herse
into

pity
such

whatever
their

could
not

resolve
never

the
gentlemen
perhaps
thought
each
to
himself
,
“
Women
will
have
their
little
nonsenses
and
needless
cares.”
One
perplexity
,
however
,
arose
,
which
the
gentlemen
did
not
disdain
:
it
regarded
a
supper-mom
.
At
the
time
of

hall

built
supper
:
had
not
been
in

;
and
a
small
card-room

was
the

addition

What

to
be
done
?

cardroom

a

or
,
if
cards
were

by
their
four
selves

still
was
it
not
too
small
for
any
comfortable
supper

the
home
,
and
a
long
awkward
passage
must
be
gone
through
to
get
at
it
.
This
made
a
difﬁculty
.
Mrs
Weston
was
afraid
of
drought
:
for
the
young
peo
le
in
that
passage
;
and
neither
Emma
nor
the
gen
men
could
tolente
the
prospect
of
being
miserably
crowded
at
su
per
.
rs
Wenon
proposed
having
no
regular
supper
;
merely
sandwiches
,
&
c.
,
set
out
in
the
little
room
;
but
that
was
taunted
at
n
wretched
suggenion
.
A
private
dance
without
sitting
down
to
supper
,
was
pronounced
an
infamous
fraud
upon
the
rith
of
men
and
women
;
and
Mrs
Weston
must
not
speak
of
it
again
.
She
then
took
another
line
of
expediency
,
and
looking
into
the
doubtful
room
,
observed
—
“I
donotthink
it
i
:
so
veryunall
.
Wenhnll
not
be
many
,
on

And
r
Weston
at
the
tame
lime
,
walking
briskly
with
long
steps
through
the
ge
,
was
calling
out
,
—
“
You
talk
a
great
deal
the
length
of

passage
,
my
dear
.
It
is
a
mere
nothing
after
all
;
and
not
the

draught
from

said
Mn

,
“one

“You

said
Emma
;
"
she

Here
Mr

joined

and
on
hating

was

gave
it
his

probao'oo

he

Emma
felt
so
torry

foresaw
so
great
a
loss
to
their
little
society
from
his
aboence
as
to
begin
to
be
afraid
of
being
too
sorry
,

feeling
it
too
much
.
It
was
a
and
change
.
They
had
been
meeting
almost
every
day
since
his
arrival
.
Certainly
his
being
at
Randalle
had
given
great
epirit
to
the
last
two
weeks
—
indeecribable
spirit
;
the
idea
,
the
expectation
of
seeing
him
which
every
morning
had
brought
,
the
assurance
of
his
attentions
,
his
liveliness
,
hie

!
It
had
been
a
very
happy
fortnight
,
and
forlorn
must
be
the
sinking
from
it
into

To

every

told
her
that
he
loved
her
.
What
strength
or
what
constancy
of
affection
he
might
be
subject
to
was
another
point
;
but
at
present
she
could
not
doubt
his
having
a
decidedly
warm
admiration
,
a
conacious
preference
of
herself
;
and
this
Persuasion
,
joined
to
all

It
was
some
days
before
she
saw
Jane
Fairfax
,
to
judge
of
her
honest
regret
in
this
woeful
change
;
but
when
they
did
meet
her
composure
was
odious
.
She
had
been
particularly
unwell
,
however
,
suffering
from
headache
to
a
degree
which
made
her
aunt
declare
that
,
had
the
hall
taken
place
,
she
did
not
think
Jane
could
have
attended
it
;
and
it
was
charity
to
impute
some
of
her
unbecoming
indifference
to
the
languor
of
ill-health
.
Chaim

MMA
continued
to
entertain
no
doubt
of
her
being
in
love
.
Her
ideas
only
varied
as
to
the
how
much
.
At
ﬁrst
she
thought
it
was
a
good
deal
;
and
afterwards
but
little
.
She
had
great
pleasure
in
hearing
Frank
Churchill
talked
of
;
and
,
for
his
sake
,
grater
pleasure
than
ever
in
seeing
Mr
and
Mrs
Weston
;
she
was
very
often
thinking
of
him
,
and
quite
impatient
for
a
letter
,
that
she
might
know
how
he
was
,
how
were
his
spirits
,
how
was
his
aunt
,
and
what
was
the
chance
of
his
coming
to
Randalls
again
thir
spring
.
But
,
on
the
other
hand
,
she
could
not
admit
herself
to
he
unhappy
,
nor
,
after
the
ﬁrst
morning
,
to

the
was

and
,

she

yet
imagine
him
to

;
and
farther
,
though
thinking
of
him
so
much
,
and
,
as
she
sat
drawing
or
working
,
forming
a

for

When
ahe
became

struck
her
that

for

in

of
her
previour
and
ﬁxed
determination

,
never
to

,
a
nrong
attachment
certainly
must
produce
more
of
a
struggle
than
Ill

could
foresee
in
her

.
“

“

from

His
inﬂammation
and
prosas
to
Enscombe
,
were
neither
worse
nor
better
than
had
been
anticipated
;
Mn
Chumhill
um
recovering
,
and
he
dared
not
yet
,
even
in
his
own
imagination
,
ﬁx
a
time
for
coming
to
Randall
:
again
.
Gratifying
,
however
,
and
nirnulative
as
was
the
letter
in
the
material
part
,
its
sentiments
,
she
yet
found
,
when
it
was
folded
up
and
returned
to
Mn
Weston
,
that
it
had
not
added
any
lasting
warmth
—
that
she
could
ﬁll
do
without
the
writer
,
and
that
he
mun
learn
to
do
without
her
.
Her
intentions
were
unchanged
.
Her
resolution
of
refusal
only
grew
more
interesting
by
the
addition
of
a
scheme
for
his
subsequent
consolation
and
happiness
.
His
recollection
of
Harriet
,
and
the
words
which
clothed
it
—
the
“
beauu'ful
little
friend
,
'
—
in|ggested
to
her
the
ides
of
Harrict’s
succeeding
her
in
his
allectiuns
.
Was
it
impossible
.’
—
-No
.
Harriet
undoubtedly
was
greatly
his
inferior
in
understanding
;
but
he
had
been
very
much
struck
with
the
loveliness
of
her
face
and
the
warm
simplicity
of
her
manner
;
and
all
the
probabilities
of
circumstance
and
connection
were
in
her
favour
.
For
Harriet
it
would
be
advantageous
and
delightful
indeed
.
“
I
must
not
dwell
upon
it
,
”
said
she
;
“
I
must
not
think
of
it
.
I
know
the
danger
of
indulging
such
speculations
.
But
stranger
things
have
happened
;
and
when
we
cease
to
care
for
each
other
as
we
do
now
,
it
will
be
the
means
of
conﬁrming
us
in
that
sort
of
true
disinterested
friendship
which
I
can
already
look
forward
to
with
pleasure.
'
It
was
well
to
have
a
comfort
in
store
on
Harriet’s
behalf
,
though
it
might
be
wise
to
let
the
fancy
touch
it
seldom
;
for
evil
in
that
quarter
was
at
hand
.

would

any

But
no
change
of
subject
could
avail
,
and
the
next
half-hour
saw
her
an
anxious
and
miles
:
about
the
Elton
:
as
before
.
At
laat
Emma
attacked
her
on
another
ground
.
“Your
allowing
yourself
to
be
an
occupied
and
so
unhappy
about
Mr
Elton’u
marrying
,
Harriet
,
is
the
atmngat
reproach
you
can
make
nu
.
You
could
not
give
me
a
greater
reproof
for
the
mistake
I
fell
into
.
t
wan
all
my
doing
,
I
know
.
I
have
not
forgotten
it

I
manure
you
.
Deceived
myaelf
,
I
did
very
minerany
deceive
you
;
and
it
will
be
a
painful
reﬂection
to
me
for
ever
.
Do
not
imagine
me
in
danger
of
forgetting
it
.
'
Harriet
felt
thin
too
much
to
utter
more
than
a
few
words
of
eager
exclamation
.
Emma
continued
—
'
“I
have
not
aid
,
exert
yourself
,
Harriet7
for
my
take
;
think
lens
,
talk
less
of
Mr
Elton
for
my
sake
;
because
,
for
your
own
sake
rather
,
I
would
wish
it
to
be
done
,
for
the
take
of
what
in
more
important
than
my
comfort
—
a
habit
of
eelf-command
in
you
,
a
conriderntion
of
what
in
your
duty
,
an
attention
to
propriety
,
an
endeavour
to
avoid
the
suspicion
of
others
,
to
save
your
health
and
credit
,
and
restore
your
tranquillity
.
These
are
the
motives
which
I
have
been
pruning
on
you
.
They
are
very
important
,
and
sorry
I
am
that
you
cannot
feel
them
sufﬁciently
to
act
upon
them
.
My
being
naved
from
pain
in
a
very
accoudary
consideration
.
I
want
you
to
save
younelf
from
greater
pain
.
Perhaps
I
may
aometimet
have
felt
that
Harriet
would
not
forget
what
wax
due
—
or
lather
,
what
would
be
kind
by
me.”
This
appeal
to
her
affections
did
more
than
all
the
met
.
The
idea
of
wanting
gratitude
and
consideration
for
Mira
Woodhouse
,
whom
she
really
loved
extremely
,
made
her
wretched
for
a
while
;
and
when
the
violence
of
grief
wan
comforted
away
,
still
remained
powerful
enough
to
prompt
to
what
was
right
,
and
support
her
in
it
very
tolembly
.
“
You
,
who
have
been
the
best
friend
I
ever
had
in
my
lifel
—
Want
gratitude

you

nobody

I

you
!
Oh
,
Min
Woodhouae
,
how

I
have
been
!
”
Such
expressions
,
assisted
as
they
were
by
everything
that
look
and
manner
could
do
,
made
Emma
feel
that
she
had
never
loved
Harriet
so
well
,
nor
valued
her
affection
so
highly
before

RS
ELTON
was
Em
seen
at
church
:
but
though
devotion
might
be
interrupted
,
curiosity
could
not
be
satisﬁed
by
a
bride
in
a
pew
,
and
it
mustbe
left
for
the
visits
in
form
which
were
then
to
be
paid
,
to
settle
whether
she
were
very
pretty
indeed
,
or
only
rather
retry
,
or
not
retty
at
all
.
Emma
had
ings
,
less
a
curiosity
than
of
pride
or
propriety
,
to
make
her
resolve
on
not
being
the
last
to
pay
her
respects
:
and
she
made
a
point
of
Harriet’s
going
with
her
,
that
the
worst
of
the
business
might
he
gone
through
as
soon
a
:
possible
.
She
could
not
enter
the
house
again
,
could
not
he
in
the
lame
room
to
which
she
had
with
such
vain
artifice
retreated
three
months
ago
,
to
lace
up
her
hoot
,
without
recolleca'ug
.
A
thousand
vexatious
thoughts
would
recur

Compliments

blunders
;
and
it
was
not
to
be
mppoeed
that
poor
Harriet
should
not
be
recollecting
too
;
but
the
behaved
very
well
,
and
was
only
rather
pale
and
Iilent
.
The
visit
was
of
court
:
short
!
and
there
wan
to
much
embarrassment
and
occu
tion
of
mind
to
charter

it
that
Emma
would
not
al
ow
heruelf
entirely
to
form
an
opinion
of
the
lady
,
and
on
no
account
to
give
one
,
beyond
the
nothing-meaning
tenm
of
being
“
elegantly
dressed
,
and
very
leasing.”
She
did
not
ly
like
her
.
She
would
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
ﬁnd
fault
,
but
the
mspected
that
there
vm
no
elegance
;
—
eaee
,
but
not
elegance
.
She
was
almost
sure
that
for
a
young
woman
,
a
stranger
,
a
bride
,
there
war
too
much
ease
.
Her
person
was
ﬂtllﬂ
'
good
;
her
face
not
unpretty
;
but
neither
feature
nor
air
,
nor
voice
,
nor
manner
were
elegant

no
,
she
would
not
permit
a
batty
or
a
witty
word
from
henelf
about
his
manners
.
It
wan
an
awkward
ceremony
at
any
time
to
be
receiving
wedding
Vinita
;
and
a
man
had
need
be
all
grace
to
acquit
himself
well
through
it
.
The

the
might
have
the
auiuauce
of

the
privilege
of

the
man
had
only
hit
own
good
sense
to
depend
on
:
and
when
the
considered
how
peculiarly
un
uclty
poor
Mr
Elton
was
in
being
in
the
me
room
at
once
with
the
woman
he
had
just
man-ind
,
the
woman
he
had
wanted
to
marry
,

the
woman
whom
he
had
been
expected
to
marry

the
moat
allow
himto
have
the
right
to
look

little

and
to
be
at
much
aﬂ‘ectedly
,
and
as
little
really
,
any
as
could
be
.
“
Well
,
Miss
Woodhouac

”
said
Harriet
,
when
they
had
quitted
the
house

after
waiting
in

for

to

;

Harriet’s
happening

superior

with

formed
in

pert
and
familiar
;
that
all
her
notions
were
drawn
from
one
net
of
people
,
and
one
nyle
of
living
;
that
,
if
not
foolish
,
she
was
ignorant
,
and
that
her
lociety
would
certainly
do
Mr
Elton
no
good
.
Harriet
would
have
been
a
better
match
.
If
not
wise
or
reﬁned
herself
,
she
would
have
connected
him
with
those
who
were

Miss
Hawking
it
might
be
fairly
luppooed
,
from
her
ealy

been
the
best
of

The
rich
brother-in-law
,
near
Briltol
,
was
the
pride
of
the
alliance
,

and
his
carriages
were
the
pride

him

Mr

;

a
comrison
of
mﬁeld
to

The
grounds
of

were
small
,
but
neat
and
pretty
;
and
the
house
wan
modern
and
well-built
.
Mn

seemed
most
favourably
imprelsed
by
ﬁle
size
of
the

the
entrance
,

all
that

Everybody

always

this
is
quite
one
of
the
evils

'
Emma
made
as
slight
a
reply
as
she
could
;
but
it
was
fully
sufﬁcient
for
Mrs
Elton
,
who
only
wanted
to
be
talking
herself
.
“
So
extremely
like
Maple
Grove
!
And
it
is
not
merely
the
house
;
the
grounds
,
I
assure
you
,
as
far
as
I
could
observe
,
are
strikingly
like
.
The
lands
at
Maple
Grove
are
in
the
lame
pmfuaion
as
here
,
and
mnd
very
much
in
the
same
way
—
just
across
the
lawn
;
and
1
had
a
glimpse
of
a
ﬁne
large
tree
,
with
a
bench
round
it
,
which
put
me
so
exactly
in
mind
!
My
brother
and
sister
will
be
enchanted
with
this
place
.
People
who
have
extensive
grounds
themselves
are
always
pleased
with
anything
in
the
ante
style.”
Emma
doubted
the
truth
of
this
sentiment
.
She
had
a
great
idea
that
people
who
had
extensive
grounds
themselves
cared
very
little
for
the
extensive
grounds
of
anybody
else
;
but
it
was
not
worth
while
to
attack
an
error
so
dmible-dyed
,
and
therefore
only
said
in
reply
—
“
When
you
have
seen
more
of

I
am
afraid
you
will
think
you

England.”
“
Yes
;
but
we
must
not
rest
our
claims
on
that
distinction
.
Many
counties
,
I
believe
,
are
called
the
garden
of
England
,
as
well
as
Surry.”
“No
,
I
fancy
not

'
replied
Mrs
Elton
,
with
a
most
satisﬁed
smile
.
"
[
I
]
never
heard
any
county
but
Surry
called
so.”
Emma
was
silenced
.
“

A

from

would

you

In
much
an
Emma
could
bear
,
without
being
impolite
!
The
idea
of
her
being
indebted
to
Mr
:
Elton
for
what
wu
called
an
inundation
—
of
her
going
into
public
under
the
ampicea
of
a
friend
of
Mn
38
nuns
.
Elton’r
—
probably
louse
vulgar
dashing
widow
,
who
,
with
the
helpofa
boarder
,
juu
made
a
shift
to
live
!
The
dignity
of
Miss
Woodhouse
,
of
Hartﬁeld
,
was
sunk
indeed
!
She
restrained
herself
,
however
,
from
any
of
the
reproofs
she
could
have
given
,
and
only
thanked
Mrs
Elton
coolly
;
“
but
their
going
to
Bath
was
quite
out
of
the
question
;
and
she
was
not
perfectly
convinced
that
the
place
might
suit
her
better
than
her
father.”
And
then
,
to
prevent
further
outrage
and
indignation
,
changed
the
subject
directly
.
“I
do
not
ask
whether
you
are
musical
,
Mrs
Elton
.
Upon
these
occasions
a
lady’s
character
generally
precedes
her
;
and
Highbury
has
long
known
that
you
are
a
superior
performer
.
'
“Oh
!
no
,
indeed
;
I
must
protest
against
any
such
idea
.
A
superior
performed
—
very
far
from
it
,
I
assure
you
:
consider
from
how
partial
a
quarter
your
infomration
mme
.
I
am
doatingly
fond
of
music
—
—
passionately
fond
;
and
my
friends
say
I
am
not
entirely
devoid
of
taste
;
but
as
to
anything
else
,
upon
my
honour
my
performance
is
"
idiom
to
the
last
degree
.
You
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
I
well
know
,
play
delightfully
.
I
assure
you
ithasbeen
the
greatest
satisfacn'on
,
comfort
,
and
delight
to
me
to
hear
what
a
musical
society
I
am
got
into
.
I
absolutely
can
not
do
without
music
;
it
is
A
necessary
of
life
to
me
;
and
having
alwys
been
used
to
a
very
musical
society
,
both
at
Maple
Grove
and
in
Bath
,
it
would
have
been
a
most
senous
sacriﬁce
.
I
honestly
said
as
much
to
Mr
E.
when
he
was
speaking
of
my
future
home
,
and
expressing
his
fears
lest
the
retirement
of
it
should
be
disagreeable
;
and
the
inferiority
of
the
house
too
—
knowing
what
I
had
been
accustomed
to
—
of
course
he
was
not
wholly
without
apprehension
.
When
he
was
speaking
of
it
in
that
way
,
I
honestly
said
that
to
:
world
I
could
give
up
—
parties
,
balls
,
plays
EMMA
.
39
—
for
I
had
no
fear
of
retirement
.
Blessed
with
so
many
resources
within
myself
,
the
wodd
was
not
necessary
to
nu
.
I
could
do
very
well
without
it
.
To
those
who
had
no
resources
it
was
a
different
thing
;
but
my
resources
made
me
quite
independent
.
And
as
tosmaller-sizedroomsthm
Ihadheenusedto
,
Irea3y
could
not
give
it
a
thought
.
I
ho
I
was
perfec
equal
to
any
sacriﬁce
of
that
descrigsion
.
Certainly
,
had
been
accuswmed
to
every
luxury
at
Maple
Grove
;
but
I
did
assure
him
that
two
carriages
were
not
necessary
to
m
happiness
,
nor
were
cious
a
rtmentl
.
‘
But
,
’
eai
I
,
‘
to
be
quite
honest
,
do
not
‘nk
I
can
live
without
something
of
a
musical
society
.
I
condition
for
nothing
else
;
but
,
without
music
,
life
would
be
a
blank
to
me.’
”
“
We
can
not
suppose
,
'
said
Emma
,
smiling
,
"
that
Mr
Elton
would
hesimte
to
assure
you
of
there
heing‘a
very
musical
society
in
Highbury
:
and
I
hope
you
will
not
ﬁnd
he
has
outstepped
the
truth
more
than
may
be
pardoned
,
in
consideration
of
the
motive.”
"
No
,
indeed
,
I
have
no
doubts
at
all
on
that
head
.
I
am
delighted
to
ﬁnd
myself
in
such
a
circle
:
I
hope
we
shall
have
many
sweet
little
concerts
together
.
I
think
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
you
and
I
must
establish
a
musical
club
,
and
have
regular
weekly
meetings
at
Iour
house
,
or
ours
.
Will
not
ithe
agood
plan
?
I
we
exert
ourselves
,
I
think
we
shall
not
be
long
in
want
of
allies
.
Something
of
that
nature
would
be
particularly
desirable
for
m
,
as
an
inducement
to
keep
me
in
practice
;
for
man'ied
women
,
you
know
—
there
is
a
sad
story
against
themI
in
general
.
They
are
but
too
apt
to
give
up
music.”
“
But
you
,
who
are
so
extremely
fond
of
itr
—
there
can
be
no
danger
,
surely
?
”
“
I
should
hope
not
;
but
really
when
I
look
around
among
my
acquamtance
,
I
tremble
.

nothing

after

Mrs

to
have
held
such
a

as
Mrs

co

There
was
no
reason
to
suppose
Mr
Elton
thought
at
all
differently
from
his
wife
.
He
oeerned
not
merely
happy
with
her
,
but
proud
.
He
had
the
air
of
congratulating
himself
on
having
brought
such
a
woman
to
Highhury
,
as
not
even
Miss
Woodhoune
could

who
readily
condoned

,
and
talked
with
a
good
grace
of
her
being
“very

,
and
very

'
In
one
respect
Mrs

grew
even
worle
than
the
had
appeared
at
ﬁrst
.
Her
feeling
:
altered
toward
:
Emma
.
Oﬂ‘ended
,
probably
,
by
the
little
encouragement
which
her
proposal
:
of
intimac
met
with
,
she
drew
back
,
in
her
turn
,
and
gradua
y
beanie
much
more
cold
and
distant
;
and
though
the
effect
wu
agreeable
,
the
ill-will
which
produced
it
waneceﬂarily
increasing
Emma'a
dislike

;
but
the
negation
:

sunk
them
both
v
much
.
It
was
not
to
be
doubted
that

had
been
an
olfering
to
conjugal
unreeerve
,
and
her
own

in

under
a
colouring
the
least
ﬁvourable
to
her
,
and

nothing

had
in
all
likelihood
been
given
also
.
She
was
,
of
course
,
the
ob'eet
of
their
joint
dislike
.
When
they
had
nothing
else
to
lay
,
it
must
be
always
easy
to
begin
abusing
Min

;
and
the
enmity
which
they
dared
not

found
a
broader
vent
in
contemptqu
treatment
of

Mn

took
a

to

only
made

of

,
with
the
umal
regular
difﬁculty
of
deciding
who
should

It
was
preasely
what
Emma
would
have

had
she
deemed
it
possible
enough
for

She
was
delighted
with
the
fortitude
of
her

—
for
fortitude
she
knew
it
was
in
her
to
give
up

and
she

invite

she
was
more
conuknwuﬁckm
about

had
often
been

Mr

words
dwelt
with

had
said
that

received

were

The
preparatory
interest
of
this
dinner
,
however
,
wan
not
yet
over
.
A
circumstance
rather
unlucky
occurred
.
The
two
eldest
little
Knightleys
mre
engaged
to

their
grand
pa
and

a
visit
of
some
weeks
in

of
this
party

Hie

not
a
low
of
hu
being
put
off
,
But
both
father
and
daughter
were
dimmed
by
its
happening
on
.
Mr
Woodhouse
conIidered
eight
persons
at
dinner
together
as
the
utmost
that
his
nerves
could
bear
—
and
here
would
be
a
ninth
—
and
Emma
apprehended
that
it
would
be
a
ninthvery
much
out
of
humour
,
at
not
being
able
to
come
even
to
Hartﬁeld
for
forty
—
eight
houn
,
without
falling
in
with
a
dinner
party
.
She
comforted
her
father
better
than
she
could
comfort
herself
,
by
representing
that
though
he
certainly
would
make
them
nine
,
yet
he
always
said
no
little
,
that
the
incmoe
of
noise
would
be
re
immaterial
.
She
thought
it
in
mlity
a
and
exchange
r
herself
,
to
have
him
,
with
his
grave
looks
and
reluctant
conversation
,
opposed
to
her
instead
of
his
brother
.
The
event
wan
more
favourable
to
Mr
Woodhouoe'
than
to
Emma
.
John
Knightley
came
;
but
Mr
Weston
was
unexpectedly
summoned
to
town
,
and
mutt
be
absent
on
the
very
day
.
He
might
he

to
'
in
them
in
the
evening
,
but
certainly
not
to
dinner
.
iWr
Woodhoule
was
quite
at
ease
;
and
the
seeing
him
to
,
with
the
arrival
of
the
little
boys
,
and
the
philonophic
composure
of
her
brother
on
hearing
hi
:
fate
,
removed
the
chief
of
even
Emma’s
vexatinn
.

day

and
Mr
John
Knighdey
learned
early
to
devote
him-elf
to
the
bulinell
of
being
agreeable
.
Instead
of
drawing

of
to
a
window
while
they
waited
for

,
he
was

coolly

it

not
your

Very

what
I

,
because

there

in

difﬁcult

the

You
can
not

Mn

of

Mr
Churchill
has
pride
;
but
his
pride
is
nothing
to
his
wife’s
;
his
is
a
quiet
,
indolent
,
gentleman-like
sort
of
pride
,
that
would
harm
nobody
,
and
only
make
himaelf
a
little
helpless
and
tiresome
;

her
pride
is
arrogance

insolence

in

who
are
such
an

from

give

!
Your
description
of
Mrs
Chum
'
made
me
think
of
them
directly
.
People
of
the
name
of
Tupman
,
very
lately
settled
there
,
and
encumbered
with
many
low
connections
,
but
giving
themselves
immense
airs
,
and
expecting
to
be
on
a
footing
with
the
old
established
ﬁrmilies
.
A
year
and
a
half
is
the
very
utmost
that
they
can
have
lived
at
West
Hall
;
and
how
they
got
their
fortune
nobody
know
.
They
came
from
Bimiingham
,
which
is
not
a
place
to
promise
much
,
you
know
,
Mr
Weston
.
One
has
not
great
hopes
from
Birmingham
.
I
always
say
there
is
something
direiiil
in
the
sound
;
but
nothing
more
is
positively
known
of
the
Tuprnans
,
though
a
good
many
things
,
I
asmre
you
,
are
suspected
;
and
yet
by
their
manner
:
they
evidently
think
themselves
equal
even
to
my
brother
,
Mr
Suckling
,
who
happens
to
be
one
of
their
nearest
neighbours

Mr

having
said
all
that

The
remaining
ﬁve
were
left
to
their
own
powers
,
and
Emma
doubted
their
getting
on
very
well
;
for
Mr
Knightley
seemed
little
disposed
for
convenau'on
;
Mn
Elton
was
wanting
notice
,
which
nobody
had
inclination
to
pay
,
and
the
was
herself
in
a
worry
of
rpirita
which
would
have
made
her
prefer
being
silent
.
Mr
John
Knightley
proved
more
talkative
than
hie
brother
.
He
was
to
leave
than
early
the
next
day
;
and
he
soon
began
with
—
“

Emma

be

Emma
u
to
the
nature

thia

all

Her

had
really

into

nothing

it
was
not
worth

if
he

who
had
undoubtedly

were
to

a

and
et

could

ing
a
crisis
,
an
event
,
a
something
to
alter
her
present
composed
and
tranquil
state
.
It
was
not
very
long
,
though
rather
longer
than
Mr
Weston
had
foreseen
,
before
she
had
the
power
of
forming
some
0
inion
of
Frank
Churchill’s
feelings
.
The
Enscombc
amin
were
not
in
town
quite
so
soon
as
had
been
imagined
,
but
he
was
at
Highbury
very
soon
afterwards
.
He
rode
down
for
a
couple
of
hours
;
he
could
not
I
:
do
more
;
but
.
as
he
came
from
Randalls
immediatey
to
Hartﬁeld
,
she
could
then
exercise
all
her
quick
observation
,
and
speedin
determine
how
he
was
inﬂuenced
,
and
how
she
must
act
.
They
met
with
the
utmost
friendliness
.
There
could
be
no
doubt
of
his
great
pleasure
in
seeing
her
.
But
she
had
an
almost
inmnt
doubt
of
his
caring
for
her
as
he
had
done
,
of
his
feeling
the
same
tenderness
in
the
same
degree
.
She
watched
him
well
.
It
was
a
clear
thing
he
was
has
in
love
than
he
had
been
.
Absence
,
with
the
conviction
probably
of
her
indiﬂ'erenoe
,
had
produced
this
veﬁnatursl
and
very
desirable
eﬂ'ect
.
e
was
in
high
irits
;
as
ready
to
talk
and
laugh
as
ever
;
and
ate
delighted
to
speak
of
his
fonner
visit
,
and
recur
to
old
stories
;
and
he
was
not
without
agitation
.
It
was
not
in
his
calmness
that
she
read
his
comparative
difference
.
He
was
not
calm
;
his
spirits
were
evidently
ﬂuttered
;
there
was
restlessness
about
him
.
Lively
as
he
was
,
it
seemed
a
liveliness
that
did
not
satisfy
himself
;
but
what
decided
her
belief
on
the
subject
,
was
his
staying
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
hurrying
away
to
make
other
calls
in
Highbury
.
“
He
ad
seen
a
group
of
old
acquaintance
in
the
street
as
he
passed
—
he
had
not
stopped
,
he
would
not
stop
for
more
than
a
word
—
but
he
had
the
vanity
to
think
they
would
be
disappoian
if
he
did
not
call
;
and
.
much
as
he
wished
to
stay
longer
at
Hartﬁeld
,
he
must
hurry
all
.

neither
his
agitated
spirits
nor
his
hurrying
away
seemed
like
a
rfect
cure
;
and
she
was
rather
inclined
to
think
it
imp
ied
a
dread
of
her
returning
power
,
and
a
discreet
revolution
of
not
trusting
himeelf
wrth
her
long
,
This
was
the
only
vitit
from
Frank
Churchill
in
the
court
:
of
ten
days
.
He
was
often
gaping
,
intending
to
come
;
but
was
alwayl
prevented
.
it
aunt
could
not
bear
to
have
him
leave
her
.
Such
wan
his
own
account
at
Randall
;
If
he
were
uite
IinCeI'e
,
if
he
really
tried
to
come
,
it
was
to
he
in
rred
that
Mn
Churchill’s
removal
to
London
had
been
of
no
Iervice
tn
the
wilful
or
nervous
part
of
her
disorder
.
That
she
was
reallyill
was
very
certain
;
he
had
declared
himtell
'
convinced
of
it
,
at
Randall
;
Though
much
might
be
fancy
,
he
could
not
doubt
,
when
he
looked
back
,
that
she
was
in
a
Weaker
muof
health
than
the
had
been
half
a
year
ago
.
He
did
not
believe
it
to
proceed
from
anything
that
care
and
medicine
might
not
remove
,
or
at
leaat
that
the
might
not
have
many
yen
of
existence
before
her
;
but
he
could
not
be
prevailed
on
,
by
all
his
father‘s
doubts
,
to
say
that
hercomplainu
were
merely
imaginary
,
or
that
the
waa
at
mung
at
ever
.
It
aoon
appeared
that
London
war
not
the
place
for
her
.
She
could
not
endure
in
noise
.
Her
nervet
were
under
continual
irritation
and
suffering
;
and
by
the
ten
days’
end
,
her
nephew’s
letter
to
Randalls
communicated
a
change
of
plan
.
They
were
going
to
remove
immediately
to
Richmond
.
Mn
Churchill
had
been
recommended
to
the
medical
sltill
of
an
eminent
person
there
,
and
had
otherwise
a
fancy
for
the
place
.
A
readyfurnithed
home
in
a
favourite
lpot
was
engaged
,
and
much
beneﬁt
expected
from
the
change
.
Emma
heard
that
Frank
wrote
in
the
highest
spiritof
this
arrangement
,
and
seemed
most
fully
to
appreciate
the
blessing
of
having
two
months
before
him
of
such
urn
.
8r
nur
neighbourhood
to
my
dear
friend
:
;
for
the
house
waa
taken
for
May
and
June
.
She
was
told
that
now
he
wrote
with
the
greatest
confidence
of
being
often
with
them
,
almost
an
often
as
he
could
even
wish
.
Emma
aw
how
Mr
Weston
undentood
the-e

He
was
considering
her
an
the
source
of
all
the
happineu
they
olfcred
.
She
hoped
it
was
not
an

Two
months
must
bring
it
to
proof
.
Mr
Weaton'u
own
happiness
was
indisputable
.
He
was
quite
delighted
.
It
was
the
very
circurnetance
he
could
have
wished
for
.
Now
,
it
would
be
fully
having
Flank
in
their
neighbourhood
.
What
were
nine
miles
to
a
young
man
?
—
—
An
hour'l
ride
.
He
would
be
always
coming
over
.
The
difference
in
that
respect
of
Richmond
and
London
was
enough
to
make
the
whole
difference
of
eeeiug
him
always
and
Ieeing
him
never

miles

.
Were
he
ever
able
to
get
away
,
the
day
would
be
spent
in
coming
and
returning
.
There
was
no
comfort
in
having
him
in
London
;
he
might
as
well
be
at
Enscombe
;
but
Richmond
was
the
very
dimnce
for
easy
intercourse
.
Better

One
good
thing
was
immediately
brought
to
a
certainty
by
thil
removal
—
the
ball
at
the

It
had
not
been
forgotten
before
;
but
it

been

it

and
that
he
had
no
doubt
of
being
able
to
join

for
twenty-four

at

Frank
Churchill
,
in

of
his
own
self
,
reached
Randalls
before
dinner
;
and
everything
was
safe
.
No

meeting
had
there
et
been
between
him
and
Emma
.
The
room
at
the
rown
was
to
witness
it
;
but
it
would
he
better
than
a
common
meeting
in
a

Mr
Weston
had
been
so
very
earnest
in
his
entreatien
for
her
early
attendance
,
for
hem-arriving
there
as
soon
at

the

she
was
going
to
exclaim
;
but
\she
presently
found
that
it
was
a
family
of
old
friends
,

were
coming

,
by
particular
desire

to

hreip
Mr
Wemn
s
judgment
;
and
they
were
so
very
dlcsely
followed
by
another
carriage
of
cousins
,
who
had
been
entreated
to
come
early
with
the
same
distinguishing
earnestness
,
on
the
same
errand
,
that
it
seemed
as
if
h‘ﬂ
'
the
company
might
soon
be
collected
together
for
the
rpose
of
preparatory
inspection
.
I
mma
perceived
that
her
taste
was
not
the
only
taste
on
which
Mr
Weston
depended
,
and
felt
that
to
be
the
faiourite
and
intimate
of
a
man
who
had
so
many
intimates
and
conﬁdantes
,
was
not
the
very
ﬁrst
distinction
in
the
scale
of
vanity
.
She
liked
his
open
manners
,
but
a
little
less
of
open-heartedness
would
have
made
him
a
higher
chamcter

The
whole
party
walked
about
,
and
looked
,
and
iced
again
;
and
then
,
having
nothing
else
to
do
,
ormed
a
sort
of
half-circle

Emma
found
that
it
was
not
Mr
Weston’s
fault
that
the
number
of
priVy
counsellors
was
not
yet
larger
.
They
had
stopped
at
Mrs

door
to
offer
the
use
of
their
carriage
,
but
the
aunt
and
niece
were
to
be
brought
by
the
Eltons
.
Frank
was
standing
by
her
,
but
not
steadily
;
there
was
a
restlessness
,
which
showed
a
mind
not

He

he
was

he
was
watching
for
the
sound
of

—
impatient
to
begin

or
afraid
of
being
always

Churchill
returned
to
his
station
by
Emma
;
and
as
soon
as
Miss
Bates
was
quiet
,
she
found
herself
necessarily
overheating
the
discourse
of
MrIElton
and
Miss
Fairfax
,
who
were
tending
a
little
way
behind
her
.
He
was
thoughtful
.
Whether
he
were
overbearing
too
she
could
not
determine
.
After
I
good
many
cornpliments
to
lane
on

dress

look
—
compliments
very
quietly
and
properly
taken
—
Mrs
Elton
was
evidentl
wanting
to
be
complimented
herself
—
and
it
was
,
"

”
vuth
many
other
relative
questions
,
all
answered
with
patient
politeness
.
Mrs
Elton
then
said
—

'
At
this
moment
Frank
began
talking
no
vigoroualy
,
that
Emma
could
not
but
imagine
he
had
overheard
his
own
pmisea
,
and
did
not
want
to
hear
more
;
—
and
the
voicea
of
the
ladies
were
drowned
for
a
while
,
till
another
Inapemion
brought
Mrs
Elton’n
tones
again
distinctly
fomrd
.
Mr
Elton
had
just
joined
them
,
and
his
wife
was
exclaiming
—

Then
changing
from
a
frown
to
a
tmilc
,
—
“No

,
—
—
I
do

know

my

When
are

to
begin
dancing
?
”
Emma
could
hardly
understand
him
;
he
neemed
in
an
odd
humour
.
He
walked
off
to
ﬁnd
his
father
,
but
was
quickly
back
again
with
both
Mr
and
Mrs
Weston
.
ElﬂlA
.
89
He
had
met
with
them
in
a
little
perplexity
,
which
must
be
laid
before
Emma
.
It
had
just
occurred
to
Mrs
Weston
that
Mrs
Elton
must
be
asked
to
begin
the
hall
;
that
she
would
expect
it
;
which
interfered
with
all
their
wishes
of
giving
Emma
that
distinction
.
Emma
heard
the
d
truth
with
fortitude
.
“And
what
are
we
to
do
for
a
proper
partner
for
her
?
”
said
Mr
Weston
.
“
She
will
think
Frank
ought
to
ask
her.”
Frank
turned
instantly
to
Emma
,
to
claim
her
former
promise
;
and
beamed
himself
an
engaged
man
,
which
his
father
looked
his
most
wﬁct
approbation
of
—
and
it
then
red
that
Mrs
eston
was
wanting
bins
to
dance
wnh
Mrs
Elton
himself
,
and
that
their
business
was
to
help
to
persuade
him
into
it
,
which
was
done
pretty
soon
.
Mr
Weston
and
Mrs
Elton
led
the
way
;
Mr
F
mnk
Churchill
and
Miss
Woodhouse
followed
.
Emma
must
submit
to
stand
scond
to
Mrs
Elton
though
she
had
always
considered
the
ball
as
peculiarly
for
her
.
It
was
almost
enough
to
make
her
think
of
marrying
.
Mrs
Elton
had
undoubtedly
the
advantage
,
at
this
time
,
in
vanity
completely
gratiﬁed
;
for
though
she
had
intended
to
begin
with
Frank
Churchill
,
she
could
not
lose
by
the
change
.
Mr
Weston
might
be
his
son’s
superior
.
In
spite
of
this
little
nib
,
however
,
Enum
was
smiling
with
enjoyment
,
delighted
to
see
the
11
>
spectable
length
of
the
set
as
it
was
forming
,
and
to
feel
that
she
had
so
many
hours
of
unusual
festivity
before
her
.
She
was
more
disturbed
by
Mr
Knighdey’s
not
dancing
than
by
anything
else
.
There
he
was
,
among
the
modern-by
,
when
:
he
ought
not
to
be
;
he
ought
to
be
dancing
,
not
classing
himself
with
the
husbands
,
and
fathers
,
and
whiIt-players
,
who
were
pretending
to
feel
an
interest
in
the
dance
till
their
rubbers
were
made
up
,
—
w
young
as
he
looked
!
He
could
not
have
appeared

.
to
greater
advtanta
rha
an
here
,
than
where
he
had
placed
himefts
.
PCl‘liswtallzwlirrn
,
upright
ﬁgure
,
among
the
bulky
forms
and
aooping
thoulders
of
the
elderly
men
,
was
such
as
Emma
felt
mutt
draw
everybody’s
eyes
;
and
,
ex
ng
her
own
partner
,
there
was
not
one
among
the
who
e
row
of
young
men
who
could
be
compared
with
him
.
He
moved
a
few
steps
nearer
,
and
thoee
few
step
:
were
enough
to
prove
in
how
gentlemanlilte
a
manner
,
with
what
natural
grace
,
he
must
have
danced
,
would
be
but
take
the
trouble
.
Whenever
she
caught
his
eye
,
she
forced
him
to
smile
;
but
in
general
he
was
looking
grave
.
She
wished
he
could
love
a
ball-room
better
,
and
could
like
Frank
Churchill
better
.
He
seemed
often
observing
her
.
She
must
not
ﬂatter
herself
that
he
thoughtof
her
dancing
;
but
if
he
were
criticising
her
behaviour
,
she
did
not
feel
afraid
.
There
was
nothing
like
ﬂirtation
between
her
and
her
partner
.
They
seemed
more
like
cheerful
any
friends
than
loven
.
That
Frank
Churchill
thought
less
of
her
than
he
had
done
was
indubitable
.
The
ball
proceeded
pleammly
.
The
anxious
cares
,
the
incessant
attentions
of
Mrs
Weston
were
not
thrown
away
.
Everybody
seemed
hapPy
;
and
the
praise
of
being
a
delightful
ball
,
which
is
seldom
bestowed
till
after
a
ball
has
ceased
to
be
,
wae
repeatedly
given
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
existence
of
this
.
Of
very
important
,
very
recordable
events
,
it
was
not
more
productive
than
such
meetings
usually
are
.
There
was
one
,
however
,
which
Emma
thought
something
of
.
—
The
two
last
dances
before
supper
were
begun
,
and
Harriet
had
no
partner
;
—
the
only
young
lady
sitting
down
;
and
to
equal
had
been
hitherto
the
number
of
dancers
,
that
how
there
could
be
any
one
disengaged
wu
the
wonder
.
But
Emma’s
wonder
lessened
soon
afterwardt
,
on
seeing
Mr
Elton
sauntering
about
.
He
would
not
ask
nuns
.
9r
Harriet
to
dance
,
ifit
were
possible
to
be
avoided
;
she
was
sure
he
would
not
—
4nd
she
was
expecting
him
every
moment
to
escape
into
the
card-room
.
Escape
,
however
,
was
not
his
plan
.
He
came
to
the
part
of
the
room
where
the
sittemby
were
collected
,
spoke
to
some
,
and
walked
about
in
front
of
them
,
as
if
to
show
his
liberty
,
and
his
resolution
of
maintaining
it
.
He
did
not
omit
being
sometimes
directly
before
Miss
Smith
,
or
speaking
to
those
who
were
close
to
her
.
Emma
saw
it
.
She
was
not
yet
dancing
;
she
was
working
her
way
up
from
the
bottom
,
and
had
therefore
leisure
to
look
around
,
and
by
only
turning
her
head
a
little
she
saw
it
all
.
When
she
was
half
way
up
the
set
,
the
whole
group
were
exactly
behind
her
,
and
she
would
no
longer
allow
her
eyes
to
watch
;
but
Mr
Elton
was
so
near
,
that
she
heard
every
syllable
of
a
dialogue
which
just
then
took
lace
between
him
and
Mrs
Weston
;
and
she
percei
that
his
wife
,
who
was
standing
immediately
above
her
,
was
not
only
listening
also
,
but
even
encournging
him
by
signiﬁcant
glances
.
The
kind-hearted
,
gentle
Mrs
Weston
had
left
her
seat
to
join
him
and
say
,
“Do
not
you
dance
,
Mr
Elton
?
”
to
which
his
prom
reply
was
,
“Most
readily
,
Mrs
Weston
,
if
you
will
nee
with
me.”
“Me
!
—
oh
!
no
—
I
would
get
you
a
better
partner
than
myself
.
I
am
no
dancer.”
“
If
Mrs
Gilbert
wishes
to
dance
,
”
said
he
,
"
I
shall
have
great
pleasure
,
I
am
sure
;
for
,
though
beginning
to
feel
myself
rather
an
old
married
man
,
and
that
m
dancing
days
are
over
,
it
would
give
me
very
reat
ensure
at
any
time
to
sand
up
with
an
old
friend
files
rs
Gilbert.”
“
Mrs
Gilbert
does
not
mean
to
dance
,
but
there
is
a
young
lady
disengaged
whom
I
should
be
very
glad
to
see
dancing
—
Miss
Smith.”
"
Miss
Smith
—
oh
l
—
I
had
not
observed
.
You
are
9
:
nuns
.
extremely
obliging
—
ond
if
I
were
not
an
old
married
—
hut
my
dancing
days
are

,
Mrs
Weston
.
You
will
excuse
me
.
Anything
else
I
should
be
most
happy
to
do
,
at
your
command
—
hut
my
dancing
days
.are
over.”
Mrs
Weston
said
no
more
;
and
Emma
could
imagine
with
what
surprize
and
mortilication
she
must
be
returning
to
her
seat
.
This
was
Mr
Elton
!
the
amiable
,
ohliging
,
gentle
Mr
Elton
.
She
looked
round
for
a
moment
;
he
had
joined
Mr
Knighth
at
a
little
distance
,
and
wan
arranging
himself
for
settled
convenition
,
while
smiles
of
high
glee
passed
between
him
and
his
wife
.
She
would
not
look
again
.
Her
heart
was
in
a
glow
,
and
she
feared
her
face
might
be
as
hot
.
In
another
moment
a
happier
right
caught
her
—
Mr
Knightley
loading
Han'iet
to
the
set
!
Never
had
she
been
more
on
riled
,
seldom
more
delighted
,
than
at
that
instant
.
he
was
all
pleasure
and
glau'tude
,
both
for
Harriet
and
herself
,
and
longed
to
be
thanking
him
;
and
though
too
distant
for
speech
,
her
countenance
said
much
,
as
soon
as
she
could
catch
his
eye
again
.
His
dancing
proved
to
he
just
what
she
had
believed
it
,
extremely
good
;
and
Harriet
would
lave
seemed
almost
too
lucky
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
the

He
shook
his

there

he
only
said
—

And

HIS
little
explanation
with
Mr
Knightley
gave
Emma
comiderable
plmmre
.
It
was
one
of
the
agreeable
recollectionof
the
ball
,
which
she
walked
about
the
lawn
the
next
morning
to
enjoy
.
She
wan
extremely
glad
that
they
had
come
to
no
good
an
understanding
respecting
the
Eltonl
,
and
that
their
opinions
of
both
huaband
and
wife
were
to
much
alike
;
and
his
nine
of
Harriet
,
his
concoction
in
her
favour
,
wan

.
The
impertinence
of
the
Eltons
,
which
for
a
few
mutants
had
threatened
to
ruin
the
mat
of
her
evening
,
had
been
the
occasion
of
name
of
its
highest
satisfaction
;
and
she
looked
forward
to
another
happy
result
—
the
cure
of
Harriet’a
infatuation
.
From
Harriet'r
manner
of
speaking
of
the
circumstance
before
they
quitted
the
ball-room

had
strong
hopes
.
It
aeemed

suddenly

and

were

to

that

headed

woman
,
and
a.

,

were
too
tempting
;
and
the
we
followed
,
or
rather
lurrounded
,
by
the
whole
gang
,
demanding
more
.
In
this
state
Frank
Churchill
had
found
her
,
the
trembling
and
conditioning
,
they
loud
and
imlent
.
By
a
moat
fortunate
chance
,
hie
leaving
Highbury
had
been
delayed
to
as
to
bring
him
to
her
auinance
at
this
critical
moment
.
The
plasantneat
of
the
morning
had
induced
him
to
walk
forward
,
and
leave
his
horses
to
meet
him
by
another
road
,
a
mile
or
two
beyond
Highbury
;
and
happening
to
have
borrowed
a
of
scissors
the
night
before
of
Miss
Bates
,
and
to
have
forgotten
to
reuore
them
,
he
had
been
obliged
to
stop
ennui
.
.
99
at
her
door
,
and
go
in
for
a
few
minutes
;
he
was
therefore
later
than
he
had
intended
;
and
being
on
foot
,
was
unseen
by
the
whole
party
till
almost
close
to
them
.
The
terror
which
thewoman
and
boy
had
been
wing
in
Harriet
was
then
their
own
portion
.
He
had
left
tlem
completely
frightened
;
and
Harriet
eagerly
clinging
to
him
,
and
hardly
able
to
speak
,
had
strength
enough
to
reach
Hatﬁeld
,
before
her
spirits
were
quite
orroome
.
It
was
his
idea
to
bring
her
to
Hartﬁeld
;
he
had
thought
of
no
other
lace
.
This
was
the
amount
of
the
whole
story
—
of
his
communication
and
of
Harﬁet’gas
soon
as
she
had
movered
her
senses
and
speech
.
He
dared
not
stay
larger
than
to
see
her
well
;
—
—
—
tholc
several
delays
loft
h’nr
not
another
minute
to
lose
;
and
Emma
engrging
to
give
assurance
of
her
safety
to
Mrs
Goddard
,
and
soh'ce
of
their
being
such
a
set
of
people
in
the
neighbourhood
to
Mr
Knightley
,
he
set
off
,
with
all
the
grateful
blessings
that
she
could
utter
for
her
friend
and
herself
.
Such
an
adventure
as
thief
—
a
ﬁne
young
man
and
a
lovely
young
woman
thrown
together
in
such
a
way
,
—
oould
hardly
fail
of
suggesting
certain
ideas
to
the
coldest
heart
and
the
steadim
brain
.
So
Emma
thought
,
at
last
.
Could
a
linguist
,
could
a
grammar-inn
,
could
even
a
mathematician
have
seen
what
she
did
.
have
witnessed
their
appearance
together
,
and
heard
their
history
of
it
,
without
feeling
that
circumstances
had
been
at
work
to
make
them
peculiarly
interesting
to
each
other
?
How

an
imaginist

like
herself
,
be

ﬁre
with
speculation
and
foresight
?
—
especially
with
such
a
groundwork
of
anticipation
as
her
nund
had
already
made
.
It
was
a
very
extraordinary
thing
!
Nothing
of
the
sort
had
ever
occurred
before
to
any
young
ladies
in
the
place
,
within
her
memory
;
no
rencontre
,
no
alarm
of
I

IMIA
.
the
kind
;
and
now
it
had
happened
to
the
very
person
,
and
at
the
very
hour
,
when
the
other
very
person
was
chnncing
to
pass
by
to
rescue
her
!
It
certainly
W

!
And
knowing
,
as
she
did
,
the
favoumhle
state“
?
mind
of
each
at
this
period
,
it
struck
her
the
more
.
He
was
wishing
to
get
the
better
of
lis
attachment
to
herself
,
she
just
recovering
from
her
maria
for
Mr
Elton
.
It
seemed
as
if
everything
united
Io
promise
the
most
interesting
consequence
.
It
was
mt
possible
that
the
occurrence
should
not
be
stronﬂy
recommending
each
to
the
other
.
In
the
few
minutes
'
conversation
which
she
had
yet
had
with
him
,
while
Harriet
had
been
partially
insensibh
,
he
had
spoken
of
her
terror
,
her
na'i‘veté
,
her
fervor
as
she
seized
and
clung
to
his
arm
,
with
a
sensibili
amused
and
delighted
;
and
at
last
,
after
Harriets
own
account
had
been
given
,
he
had
ex
reused
his
indignation
at
the
abominable
folly
of
Miss
iekerton
in
the
warmest
terms
.
Everything
was
to
take
its
natural
course
,
however
,
neither
impelled
nor
assisted
.
She
would
not
stir
a
signer
dro
a
hint
.
No
,
she
had
had
enough
of
inte
noe
.
re
could
be
no
harm
in
a
scheme
,
a
mere
passive
scheme
.
It
was
no
more
than
a
wish
.
Beyond
it
she
would
on
no
account
proceed
.
Emma’s
ﬁrst
resolution
was
to
keep
her
father
from
the
knowledge
of
what
had
passed
,
aware
of
the
anxiety
and
alarm
it
would
occasion
;
but
she
soon
felt
that
concealment
must
be
impossible
Within
half
an
hour
it
was
known
all
over
Highbury
.
It
was
the
very
event
to
engage
those
who
talk
most
—
the
young
and
the
low
;
and
all
the
ﬁnds
and
servants
in
the
place
were
soon
in
the
lulppincts
of
frightful
news
.
The
last
night’s
ball
seemed
lost
in
the
gipsies
.
Poor
Mr
Woodhouse
trembled
as
he
sat
,
and

as
Emma
had
foreseen
,

Itwaa
some
comfort
to
hilir
that

after
himself
and
Min
Woodhouae

for

that

were
coming
in
during
the
rest
of
the
day

and
he
had
the
pleasure
of
returning
for
answer
,
that
they
were
all
very
indifferent
;
which
,
though
not

true
,
for

was
perfectly

would

for

for
she
hardl

and
if

lnenee
for
her
,
she
could
make

.
The
gipaiea
did
not
wait
for
the
operations
of
justice
;
they
took
themselves
at

in
a
hurry
.
The

of

might
have
walked
again
in

before
their
panic
began
,
and
the
whole
history
dwind

into

matter

to
Emma

it

A

few

had
ylmd
after

,
when
Harriet
came
one
morning
to
Emma
with
a
small
parcel
in
her
hand
,
and
after
sitting
down

hesitating

began

,
which

opened
:
it
was
well
lined
with
the

cotton
;
but
,
excepting
the
cotton
,
Emma
saw
only
a
small
piece
of
court-plaister
.
“
Now

Harriet
,
“

“No
,
indeed
,
I
do
not.”
“Dear
me
!
I
should
not
have
thought
it
possible
you
could
forget
what
passed
in
this
very
room
about
courtrplaister
,
one
of
the
very
last
times
we
ever
met
in
it
.
It
was
but
a
very
few
(
L1
s
before
I
had
my
sore
thrash
—
just
before
Mr
and
rs
John
Knightley
came
;
I
think
the
very
evening
.
Do
not
you
remember
his
cutting
his
ﬁnger
with
your
new
penknife
,
and
your
recommending
oourt-plnister
?
But
,
as
you
had
none
about
you
,
and
knew
I
bad
,
you
desired
me
to
supply
him
;
and
so
I
took
mine
out
,
and
cut
him
a
piece
:
but
it
was
a
great
deal
too
large
,
and
he
cut
it
smaller
,
and
kept
playing
some
time
with
what
was
left
before
he
gave
it
back
to
me
.
And
so
then
,
in
my
nonsense
,
I
could
not
help
making
a
treasure
of
it
;
so
I
put
it
by
,
never
to
be
used
,
and
looked
at
it
now
and
then
as
a
great
treat.”
“My
dearest
Harriet
!

cried
Emma
,
putting
her
hand
before
her
face
,
and
jumping
up
,
“
you
make
me
more

myself
than
I

Harriet

to
have

.
About
a
fortnight
after
the
alarm
they
came
to
a
sufﬁcient
explanation
,
and
quite
undeaignedly
.
Emma
was
not
thinking
of
it
at
the
moment
,
which
made
the
infbrmah'on
the
received
more
valuable
.
She
merel
aid
in
the
course
of
some
trivial
chat
,
“Well
,
Harriet
,
whenever
you
marry
,
I
106
nuns

would
advise
you
to
do
so
and
so
"
—
and
thought
no
more
of
it
,
till
,
after
a
minute’s
silence
she
heard
Harriet
say
,
in
a
very
serious
(
one
,
“I
shall
never
marry.’'
Emma
then
looked
up
,
and
immediately
saw
how
it
was
;
and
after
a
moment’s
debate
,
a
to
whether
it
should
pass
unnoticed
or
not
,
replied
—
“
Never
marry
l
—
This
is
a
new
rewlution.”
"
It
is
one
that
I
shall
never
change
,
however.”
After
another
short
hesitation
,
“
I
ha
it
doel
not

I
hope
it
is
not

"
“Mr

,
indeed

cried
Harriet
,
indignantl
.
“
Oh
l
no
"
—
and
Emma
could
just
catch
the
wordii
,
“
so
superior
to
Mr
Elton
!
”
She
then
took
a
longer
time
for
considerstion
.
Should
she
proceed
no
farther

—
should
she
let
it
pass
,
and
seem
to
mpect
nothing
P
—
Perhaps
Harriet
might
think
her
cold
or
angry
if
Ihe
did
;
or
,
perhaps
,
if
she
were
totally
silent
,
it
might
only
drive
Harriet
into
asking
her
to
hear
too
much
;
and
ngaim
anything
like
such
an
unreserve
as
had
been
,
such
an
open
and
frequent

June
opened
upon
Hatﬁeld

To
Highbury
,
in

,
it
brought
no
material
change

The

were
mill
talking
of
a
visit
from
the
Sucklings
,
and
of
the
use
to
be
made
of
their
harouehe-landau
,
and
Jane
Fairfax
was
still
at
her
grandmother’a
;
and
as
the
return
of
the
Cumpbells
from
Ireland
wan
again
delayed
,
and
August
,
instead
of
Midsummer
,
ﬁxed
for
it

was
likely
to
remain
(
here
full
two
months
longer
,
provided
at
least
she
were
able
to
defeat
Mrs
Ellen’s
activity
in
her
service
,
and
save
herself
from
being
hurried
into
a
delightful
situation
against
her
will
.
Mr
Knightley
,
who
,
for
some
reason
best
known
to
himself
,
had
certainly
taken
an
early
dislike
to
F
mnk
Churchill
,
was
only
growing
to
dislike
him
more
.
He
began
to
ulpect
him
of
tome
double
dealing
in
his
pursuit
of
Emma
.
That
Emma
was
his
object
appeared
indisputable
.
Everything
declared
it
;
his
own
attention
,
hi

Father
s
hints
,
his
mother-in-law’a
guarded
lence
;
it
was
all
in
unison
;
words
,
conduct
,
discretion
and
indiscretion
,
told
the
same
story
.
But
while
so
many
were
devoting
him
to
Emma
,
and
Emma
herself
making
him
over
to
Harriet
,
Mr
Knightley
began
to
suspect
him
of
some
inclination
to
triﬂe
with
Jane
EMMA
.
I

Fairfax
.
He
could
not
understand
it
;
but
there
were
symptoms
of
intelligence
between
slum
—
he
thought
so
at
least
—
symptoms
of
admiration
on
his
side
,
which
,
having
once
observed
,
he
could
not
per-wade
himself
to
think
entirely
void
of
meaning
,
however
,
he
might
wish
to
escape
any
of
Emma’s
errors
of
imagination
.
Sb
:
was
not
present
when
the
suspicion
ﬁrst
arose
.
He
was
dining
with
the
Randalls
family
and
Jane
at
the
Eltons’
;
and
he
had
seen
a
look
,
more
than
a
single
look
,
at
Miss
Fairfax
,
which
,
from
the
admirer
of
Miss
Woodhonse
,
seemed
somewhat
out
of
place
.
When
he
was
again
in
their
company
,
he
could
not
help
remembering
what
he
had
seen
;
nor
could
he
avoid
observations
which
,
unless
it
were
like
Cowper
and
his
ﬁre
at
twihghg
“
Myself
creating
what
I
saw
,
”
brought
him
yet
stronger
suspicion
of
there
being
a
something
of
private
liking
.
of
private
understanding
even
,
between
F
rank
Churchill
and
Jane
.
He
had
walked
up
one
day
after
dinner
,
as
he
very
often
did
,
to
spend
his
evening
at
Hartlield
.
Emma
and
Han-iet
were
going
to
walk
;
he
joined
them
;
and
,
on
returning
,
they
fell
in
with
a
larger
party
,
who
like
themselves
,
judged
it
wisest
to
take
their
exercise
early
,
as
the
weather
threatened
rain
;
Mr
and
Mrs
Weston
and
their
son
,
Miss
Bates
and
her
niece
,
who
had
accidentally
met
.
They
all
united
;
and
,
on
reaching
Hartlield
gates
,
Emma
,
who
knew
it
was
exscd
the
sort
of
visiting
that
would
be
welcome
to
her
fiither
,
pressed
them
all
to
go
in
and
drink
tea
with
him
.
The
Randalls
party
agreed
to
it
immediately
;
and
after
a
retty
long
speech
from
Miss
Bates
,
which
few
persons
listened
to
,
she
also
found
it
possible
to
accept
dear
Miss
Woodhouse’s
most
obliging
invitation

they

after
every

took
it
up
,
and
fell
to
work
.
She
was
sitting
by
lab
Knightley
,
and
turned
to
him
for
help
.
The
word
was
blunder
,
and
as
Harriet
exnltingly
proclaimed
it
,
there
was
a
blush
on
Jane’s
cheek
which
ave
it
a
meaning
not
otherwise
ostensible
.
Mr
Knigh
cy
connected
it
with
the
dram
;
but
how
it
could
all
be
,
was
beyond
his
comprehension
.
How
the
delicacy
,
the
discretion
of
his
favourite
could
have
been
n4
suns
.
so
lain
asleep
!
He
feared
there
mun
be
some
decided
involvement
.
Dingmuousnm
and
double
dealing
seemed
to
meet
him
at
every
turn
.
These
letters
were
but
the
vehicle
for
gallantry
and
trick
.
It
was
a
child’s
play
,
chosen
to
conceal
a
deeper
game
on
Frank
Churchill’s
part
.
With
great
indignation
did
he
continue
to
observe
him
;
with
great
alarm
and
dinnm
,
to
observe
also
his
mo
blinded
companions
.
He
saw
a
short
word
prepared
for
Emma
,
and
given
to
her
with
a
look
sly
and
demure
.
He
saw
that
Emma
had
soon
made
it
out
.
snd
found
it
highly
entertaining
,
though
it
was
something
which
she
judged
it
pro
r
to
appear
to
censure
;
for
she
aid
,
“
Nonsense
!
or
shame
!
”
He
heard
Funk
Churchill
next
say
,
with
a
glance
towards
June
,
“
I
will
give
it
to
her
—
shall
I
i”
and
as
clearly
heard
Emma
oppodng
it
with
eager
laughing
warmly
—
“No
,
no
,
you
must
not
,
you
shall
not
,
indeed.”
It
was
done
,
however
.
This
gallant
young
man
,
who
seemed
to
love
without
feeling
,
and
to
recommend
himself
without
complaisance
,
directly
handed
over
the
word
to
Miss
Fairfax
,
and
with
a
particular
degree
of
sedate
civility
entreated
her
to
study
it
.
Mr
Knightleﬁs
exceeaive
curiosity
to
lrnow
what
this
werd
might
,
made
him
seize
every
possible
moment
for
darting
his
eye
towards
it
,
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
saw
it
to
he
Dixon
.
Jane
Fairfax’s
perception
seemed
to
accom
‘
ny
his
;
her
comprehension
was
certainly
more
equa
to
the
covert
meaning
,
the
mperior
intelligence
,
of
those
ﬁve
letters
so
arranged
.
She
was
evidently
displeased
;
looked
up
,
and
seeing
herself
watched
,
blushed
more
deeply
than
he
had
ever
perceived
her
,
and
saying
only
,
“
I
did
not
know
that
proper
names
were
allowed

letters

as

as

he
was
immediately
up
,
and
wanting
to
quit
the
table
:
but
so
many
were
also
moving
,
that
she
could
not
get
away
;
and
Mr
Kuightley
thought
he
saw
anodier
collection
of
letters
,
anxiously
pushed
towards
her
,
and
resolutely
swept
away
by
her
unexamined
.
She
was
afterwards
looking
for
her
shawl
—
Frank
Churchill
was
looking
also
:
it
was
growing
dusk
,
and
the
room
was
in
confusion
;
and
how
thezlpaned
Mr
Knightley
could
not
tell
.
e
remained
at
Hartlield
afar
all
the
rest
,
his
thoughts
full
of
what
he
had
seen
;
so
full
,
that
when
the
candles
came
to
assist
his
observations
,
he
must
—
yes
,
he
certainly
must
,
as
a
friend
—
an
anxious
friend
—
—
give
Emma
some
him
,
ask
her
some
question
.
He
could
not
see
her
in
a
situation
of
such
danger
without
trying
to
preserve
her
.
It
was
his
duty
.
“Pray

said
he
,
“my
I

Emma
was
extremely
confused
.
She
could
not
endure
to
give
him
the
true
explanation
;
for
though
her
cions
were
by
no
means
removed
,
she
was
really
ashamed
of
having
ever
imparted
them
.
“Oh
!

she
cried
injeudent
embarrassment
,
“it
all
meant
nothing
,
a

“The

he
replied
gravely
,
“teemed

Mr

e
had
hoped
she
would
speak
again
,
but
the
did
not

She
would
rather
hney
herself
about
anything
than

a
little
while
in

Emma’s
confusion
,
and
the
acknowledged
intimacy
,
seemed
to
declare
her
aﬁ'ection
engaged
.
Yet
he
would
speak
.
He
owed
it
to
her
,
to
risk
anything
that
might
be
involved
in
an

to

world
were

to
endure
the
ramiﬁcation
of
hearing
that

No

whose
happiness

it
was
to

hoped
,
might
eventually

as
much
increased
by
the
arrival
of
a
child
,
as
that
of
all
her
neighbour
:
was
by
the
approach
of
it
.
Mrs
Elton
was
very
much
disappointed
.
It
was
the
delay
of
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
and
pande
.
Her
introductions
and
recommendations
must
all
wait
,
and
every
projected
party
be
still
only
talked
of
.
So
she
thought
at
ﬁrst
;
but
a
little
consideration
convinced
her
that
everything
need
not
be
put
off
.
Wh
should
not
they
explore
to
Box
Hill
though
the
Sun
inge
did

They
could
go
there
again
with
them
in
the
autumn
.
It
was
settled
that
they
should
go
to
Box
Hill
.
That
there
was
to
be
such
a
party
had
been
long
generally
known
;
it
had
even
given
the
idea
of
another
.
Emma
had
never
been
to
Box
Hill
;
she
wished
to
see
what
eve
body
found
so
well
worth
lecing
,
and
she
and
Mr
woman
had
agreed
to
choose
some
ﬁne
morning
and
drive
thither
.
Two
or
three
more
of
the
choten
only
were
to
be
admitted
to
join
them
,
and
it
was
to
be
done
in
a
quiet
,
unpretending
,
elegant
way
,
inﬁnime
superior
to
the
bustle
and
preparation
,
the
regular
eating
and
drinking
,
and
piconic
parade
of
the
Eltona
and
the
Suckling
;
.
This
was
so
very
well
understood
between
them
that
Emma
could
not
but
feel
some
surprise
,
and
a
little
displeasure
,
on
hearing
from
Mr
Wenon
that
he
had
been
reporting
to
Mrs
Elton
,
as
her
brother
and
sister
had
.
iled
her
,
that
the
two
parties
should
unite
,
and
go
together
;
and
that
an
Mrs
Elton
had
very
readily
acceded
to
it
,
so
it
was
to
be
,
if
she
had
no
objection
.
Now
,
as
her
objection
was
nothing
but
her
very
great
dislike
of
Mrs
Elton
,
of
which
Mr
Weston
must
already
be
Perfectly
aware
,
it
waa
not
worth
bringing
forward
again
:
—
it
could
not
be
done
without
a
reproof
to
him
,
which
would
be
giving
pain
to
his
wife
;
and
she
found
herself
,
therefore
,
obliged
to

which
she
would
have
done
a
great
deal
to
avoid
;
an
arrangement
which
would
,
probably
,
expose
her
even
to
the
degradation
of
being
said
to
be
of
Mn
Elton’s
party
!
Every
feeling
was
offended
;
and
the
forbearance
of
her
outward
submission
left
a
heavy
arrear
due
of
secret
severity
in
her
reﬂections
,
on
the
unmanageable
good-will
of
Mr
Woman
s
temper
.
“I
am
glad
you
approve
of
what
I
have
done
,
”
said
he
,
very
comfombly
.
“
But
I
thought
you
would
.
Such
schemes
as
these
are
nothing
without
numbers
.
One
can
not
have
too
large
a
party
.
A
large
party
secures
its
own
amusement
.
And
she
is
a
good-natured
woman
after
all
.
One
could
not
leave
her
out.”
Emma
denied
none
of
it
aloud
,
and
agreed
to
none
of
it
in
private
.
It
was
now
the
middle
of
June
and
the
weather
ﬁne
;
and
Mn

was

he
ventured
on
,
and
it
was
all
melancholy
stagnation
.
Mrs
Elton’s
resources
were
inadequate
to
such
an
attack
.
"

most
vexatious

she
cried
;

like

It

My

The

I
think
is

observed
by

'
r
Knightley
had
another
reason
for
avoiding
a
table
in
the
shade
.
He
wished
to
persuade
Mr
Woodhouse
,
as
well
as
Emma
,
to
join
the
party
;
and
he
knew
that
to
have
any
of
them
sitting
down
out
of
door
:
to
eat
would
inevitably
make
him
ill.
Mr
Woodhousc
must
not
,
under
the
specious
gen-nee
of
a
morning
drive
,
and
an
hour
or
two
spent
at
onwell
,
be
tempted
.
away
to
his
misery
.
He
was
invited
on
good
faith
.
No
lurking
horrors
were
to
u
mid
him
for
his
easy
credulity
.
He
did
consent
.
e
had
not
been
at
Donwell
for
two
years
.
“
Some
very
ﬁne
morning
,
he
,
and
Emma
,
and
Harriet
could
go
very
well
;
and
he
could
sit
still
with
Mr

Weston
while
the
dear
girls
walked
about
the
gardens
.
He
did
not
suppose
they
could

damp
now
,
in
the
middle
of
the
day
.
He
should
like
to
see
the

exceedingly
,
and
should
he
very
happy
to
meet
t
and
Mn
Elton
,
and
any
other
of
his
neighbours
.
He
could
not
see
any
objection
at
all
to
his
,
and
Emma’s
,
and
Harriet
s
going
there
some
very
ﬁne
morning
.
He
thought
it
very
well
done
of
Mr
Knightleytoinvitethem
;
very
kindand
sensible
;
much
cleverer
than
dining
out
.
He
was
not
fond
of
dining
out.”
Mr
Knightle
was
fortunav
:
in
everybody’s
most
read
concurrence
.
‘he
invitation
was
everywhere
so
wel
received
,
that
it
seemed
as
if
,
like
Mrs
Elton
,
they
were
all
taking
the
scheme
as
a
particular
compliment
to
themaelves
.
Emma
and
Harriet
professed
very
high
expectations
of
pleasure
from
it
;
and
Mr
Weston
,
unasked
,
promised
to
get
Frank
over
to
them
,
if
possible
;
a
proof
of
approbation
and
gratitude
which
could
have
been
dispensed
with
.
Mr
Knightley
was
then
obliged
to
my
that
he
should
be
glad
to
see
him
;
and
Mr
Weston
engaged
to
lose
no
time
in
writing
,
and
spare
no
mgunwnts
to
induce
him
to
come
.
In
the
meanwhile
the
lame
horse
recovered
so
fast
that
the
party
to
Box
Hill
was
again
under
ha
y
consideration
;
and
at
last
Donwell
was
settled
1
'
one
day
;
and
Box
Hill
for
the
next
,
the
weather
appearing
exactly
right
.
Under

,
at

,
Mr
Woodhouse
was
safely
conveyed
in

with

,

to

and

more
exact
understanding
of
a
house
and
groundo
which
mun
ever
be
to
interesting
to
her
and
all
her
family
.
She
felt
all
the
honett

and
complacency
which
her
alliance
with
the
present
and
future
pro
etor
could
fairly
waran

respec

in

and

;
it
:
ample
gardens
stretching
down
to
meadows
washed
by
a
stream
,
of
which
the
A
,
with
all
the
old
neglect
of

,
had
scarcely

beysight
—
and
in
abundance
of
tiinber
in
rows
and
avenues
,
which
neither
faahion
nor
extravagance
had
rooted
up
.
The
house
was
larger
than
artﬁeld
,
and
totally
unlike
it
,
covering
a
good
deal
of
ground
,
rambling
and
irregular
,
with
many
comfortable
,
and
one
or
two
hand-ome
room
.
It
was
just
what
it
ought
to
be
,
and
it
looked
what
it
was
;
and
Emma
felt
an
increasing
respect
for
it
,
as
the
residence
of
a
family
of
such
true
gentility
,
unmlntetl
in

and
underamnding
.
Some
faults
of
temper
John
Kuiglltlcy
had
;
but
Isabella
had
connected
herself
unexceptionally
.
She
had
given
them
neither
men
,
nor
names
,
nor
places
,
that
could
raise
a
blush
.
Thane
were
pleasant
feelings
,
and
she
walked
about
and
indulged
them
till
it
was
necestary
to
do
as
the
others
did
,
and
collect
round
the
strawberry-beds
.
The

Such
,
for
half
an
hour
,
was
the
conversation
;
interrupted
only
once
by
Mrs
Weston
,
who
came
out
,
in
her
solicitude
after
her
son
—
in-lnw
,
to
inquire
if
he
were
come
;
and
she
was
a
little
uneasy
.
She
had
some
fears
of
his
horse
.
Sears
tolembly
in
the
shade
were
found
;
and
now
Emmawas
obliged
to
overhear
what
Mrs
Elton
and
Jane
Fairfax
were
talking
of
.
A
situation
,
a
most
desirable
situation
,
was
in
question
.
Mrs
Elton
had
received
notice
of
it
that
morning
,
and
was
in
m
tures
.
It
was
not
with
Mrs
Suckling
,
it
was
not
wi
Mrs
Bmgge
,
but
in
felicity
and
splendour
it
fell
short
only
of
them
:
it
was
with
a
cousin
of
Mrs
Bragge
,
an
acquaintance
of
Mrs
Suckling
,
a
lady
known
at
Ma
le
Grove
.
Delightful
,
charming
,
superior
,
first
circes
,
spheres
,
lines
,
ranks
,
everything
:
and
Mrs
Elton
was
II
.
I
126
units
.
wild
to
have
the
oﬁ'cr
closed
with
immediately
.
On
her
side
,
all
was
warmth
,
energy
,
and
triumph
;
and
she
positively
refused
to
take
her
friend’s
negative
,
though
Miss
Fairfax
continued
to
assure
her
that
she
would
not
at
present
engage
in
anything
—
Wong
the
same
motives
which
she
had
been
heard
to
urge
before
.
Still
Mrs
Elton
insisted
on
being
authorized
to
write
an
acquiescence
by
the
morrow’s
post
.
How
Jane
could
hear
it
at
all
,
was
astonishing
to
Emma
.
She
did
look
vexed
;
she
did
speak
pointedly
;
and
at
last
,
with
a
decision
of
action
unusual
to
her
,
roposed
a
removal
.
“Should
not
they
walk
?
W
d
not
Mr
Knightlcy
show
them
the
gardens
—
all
the
gardens
?
She
wished
to
see
the
whole
extent.”
The
pettiuacity
of
her
ﬁiend
seemed
more
than
she
could
bear
.
It
was
hot
;
and
after
walking
some
time
over
the
gardens
in
a
scattered
,
dispersed
way
,
scarcely
any
three
together
,
they
insensibly
followed
one
another
to
the
delicious
shade
of
a
broad
short
avenue
of
limes
,
which
,
stretching
beyond
the
garden
at
an
equal
distance
from
the
river
,
seemed
the
ﬁnish
of
the
pleasure
grounds
.
It
led
to
nothing
;
nothing
but
a
view
at
the
end
over
a
low
stone
wall
with
high
pillars
,
which
seemed
intended
,
in
their
erection
,
to
give
the
appearance
of
an
approach
to
the
hmwe
,
which
never
had
been
there
.
Diqiutable
,
however
,
as
might
be
the
taste
of
such
a
termination
,
it
was
in
itself
a
charming
walk
,
and
the
View
which
closed
it
extremely
pretty
.
The
considerable
slope
,
at
nearly
the
foot
of
which
the
Abbey
stood
,
gradually
acquired
a
steeper
form
beyond
its
grounds
;
and
at
half
a
mile
distant
wasa
bank
of
considerable
abruptncss
and
grandeur
,
well
clothed
with
wood
;
and
at
the
bottom
of
this
bunk
,
favourably
placed
and
sheltered
,
rose
the
Abbey
Mill
Farm
,
with
meadows
in
front
,
and
the
river
making
a
close
and
handsome
curve
around
it
.

In
this
walk
Emma
and
Mr
Weston
found
all
the
others
assembled
;
and
toward
:
this
view
she
immediately
perceived
Mr
Knightley
and
Harriet
distinct
from
the
rest
,
quietly
leading
the
way
.
Mr
Knightloy
and
Harriet
!
It
was
an
odd
téte-i-téte
;
but
she
was
glad
to
see
it
.
There
had
been
a
time
when
he
would
have
scomed
her
as
a
companion
,
and
turned
from
her
with
little
ceremony
.
Now
they
seemed
in
pleasant
conversation
.
There
had
been
a
time
also
when
Emma
would
have
been
sorry
to
see
Harriet
in
a
spot
so
favourable
for
the
Abbey
Mill
Farm
;
but
now
she
feared
it
not
.
It
might
be
safely
viewed
,
with
all
its
appendages
of
prosperity
and
beauty
,
its
rich

more
engaged

than
in
looking
around

He
was
giving
Han'iet
information
as
to

,
&

;
and
Emma
received
a
smile
which
seemed
to
say
,
“
These
are
my
own
concerns
.
I
have
a
right
to
talk
on
such
subjects
,
without
being
suspected
of
introducing
Robert
Martin
.
'
She
did
not
suspect
him
.
It
was
too
old
a
story
.
Robert
Martin
had
probably
ceased
to
think
of
Harriet
.
They
took
a
few
turns
together
along
the
walk
.
The
shade
was
moot
refreshing
,
and
Emma
found
it
the
pleasantest
part
of
the
day
.
The
next
remove
was
to
the
house
;
they
must
all
go
in
and
eat
;
and
they
were
all
seated
and
buy
,
and
still
Frank
Churchill
did
not
come
.
Mrs
Weston
looked
,
and
looked
in
vain
.
His
father
would
not
own
himself
uneay
,
and
laughed
at
her
fears
;
but
she
could
not
be
cured
of
wishing
that
he
would
part
with
his
black
mare
.
He
had
expressed
himself
as
to
coming

.
“His
aunt
was
so
much
better
,
that
he
had
not
a
doubt
ofgutting

to
them.”
Mn
Churchill’s
state
,
however
,
as
mny
were
ready
to
remind
her
,
was
liable
to
such
mdden
variation
as
might

and
Mr

was
at

persuaded
to
believe
,
or
to
any
,
that
it
must
be
by
some
attack
of
Mn
:
Churchill
that
he
was
prevented
coming
.
Emma
looked
at
Harriet
while
the
point
.
was
under
consideration
;
she
behaved
very
well
,
and
betrayed
no
emotion

his

that
Mrs

might
be
persuaded
away
by
her
husband
to
the
exercise
and
variety
which
her
spirits
seemed
to

Mr

had
done

had
perfectly

Mr

had
been
exceedingly
well
amused

Mrs

had
been

was
hardly
there
when
Jane
Fairfax
appeared
,
coming
quickly
in
from
the
garden
,
and
with
a
look
of
escape
.
Little
expecting
to
meet
Miss
Woodhonse
so
soon
,
there
was
a
start
at
ﬁrst
;
but
Miss
Woodhouse
was
the
very
person
she
was
in
quest
of
.
“Will

”
said
she
,
“

and
I
am

to
go
directly

I
have
said
nothing
about
it
to
anybody

It
would
only
be
giving
trouble
and
distress
.
Some
are
gone
to
the

,
and
some
to
the

“
Certainly
,
if
you
wish
it
;
but
you
are
not
going

"
"
Yes

She
spoke
with
great
agitation
;
and
Emma
very
feelineg
replied
—
“

“

,
“

it
is
not

Emma
land
not
another
word
to
oppose
.
She
saw
it
all
;
and
entering
into
her
feelings
,
promoted
her
quitting
the
house
immediately
,
and
watched
her
safer
off
with
the
zeal
of
a
friend
.
Her
rting
look
was
grateful
;
and
her
parting
words
,
“
Ir
!
Miss
Woodhouae
,
the
comfort
of

"
seemed
to
burst
from
an
overcharged
heart
.
and
to
delcrihe
now
what
of
the
continual
endurance
to
be
practised
by
her
,
even
towards
some
of
those
who
loved
her
best
.
“
Such
a
home
,
indeed
!
such
an

Emma
,
as
she
turned
back
into
the
hall
again
.
“

Jane
had
not
been
gone
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
they
haul
only
accomplde
some
views
of
St
Mark’Plaoe
,
Venice
,
when
Frank
Churchill
entered
the
room
.
Emma
had
not

He
had
been
detained
by
a
temporary
increase
of
illness
in
her
—

nervous
seizure
which
had
lasted
some
hours
;
and
he
had
quite
given
up
every
thought
of
coming
till
very
late
;
and
had
he
known
how
ho

a

how

,
with
all
his
hurry
,
he
must

,
he
believed
he

The
heat
was
excessive
;

never

anything

it
—

,

and

rat
down
,
at
the
greatest
possible
distance
from
the
slight

of

”
Emma
listened
,
and
looked
,
and
soon
perceived
that
Frank
Churchill’s
rtate
might
be
beat
deﬁned
by
the
expressive
phrase
of
being
out
of
humour
.
Some
people
were
always
crosn
when
they
were
hot
.
Such
might
be
his
constitution
;
and
as
she
knew
that
eating
and
drinking
were
often
the
cure
of
such
incidental
complaints
,
the
recommended
his
taking
some
refreshment
;
he
would
find
abundance
of
everything
in
the
diningroom
;
and
the
humaner
pointed
out
the
door
.
“
No
;
he
should
not
eat
.
He
was
not
hungry
;
it
would
only
make
him
hotter
.
'
In
two
minutes
,
however
,
he
relented
in
his
own
favour
;
and
muttering
something
about
spruce-beer
,
walked

'
.
Emma
returned
all
her
attention
to
her
father
,
saying
in
accret
—
“

She
smiled

from

to

had
a
very
line
day
for
Box
Hill
;
and
all
the
other
outward
circumstances
of
Imagement
,
accommodation
,
and
punctuality
,
were
in
favour
of
a
pleasant
party
.
Mr
Weston
directed
the
whole
,
ofﬁciating
safely
between
Hartﬁeld
and
the
Vicarage
,
and
everybody
was
in
good
time
.
Emma
and
Harriet
went
together

and
her
niece
with

Eltoua
;
the
gentlemen

nuns

remained
with
Mr
Woodhouse
.
Nothing
was
wanting
but
to
be
happy
when
they
got
there
.
Seven
miles
were
travelled
in
expectation
of
enjoyment
,
and
everybody
had
a
burst
of
admiration
on
ﬁrst
arriving
;
but
in
the
general
amount
of
the
day
there
was
deﬁciency
.
There
was
a
languor
,
a
want
of
spirits
,
a
want
of
union
,
which
could
not
be
got
over
.
They
separated
too
much
into
parties
.
The
Elton
:
walked
together
;
Mr
Knightley
took
charge
of
Miss
Bates
and
Jane
;
and
Emma
and
Harriet
belonged
to
Frank
Churchill
.
And
Mr
Weaon
tried
,
in
vain
,
to
make
them
harmonise
better
.
It
accrued
at
Iim
an
accidental
division
,
but
it
never
materially
varied
.
Mr
and
Mr
:
Elton
,
indeed
,
showed
no
unwillingness
to
mix
,
and
be
as
agreeable
as
they
could
;
but
during
the
two
whole
hours
that
were
spent
on
the
hill
,
there
seemed
a
principle
of
separation
between
the
other
mrties
,
too
strong
for
any
ﬁne
Wapects
,
or
any
coid
collation
,
or
any
cheerful

seen
Frank
Churchill
so
ilent
and
stupid
.
He
said
nothing
worth
hearing
—
~looked
without
seeing
u-admired
without
intelligence
—
listened
without
knowing
what
she
said
.
While
he
was
no
dull
,
it
was
no
wonder
that
Harriet
should
be
dull
likewise
;
and
they
were
both
insufferable
.
When
they
all
sat
down
it
was
better
—
to
her
taste
a
great
deal
better
—
for
Frank
Churchill
grew
talkative
and
gay
,
making
her
his
ﬁrst
object
.
Every
distinguishing
attention
that
could
be
paid
,
was
paid
to
her
.
To
amuse
her
,
and
be
agreeable
in
her
eyes
,
seemed
all
that
he
cared
for
—
and
Emma
,
glad
to
be
enlivened
,
not
sorry
to
be
ﬂattered
,
\m
gay
and
easy
too
,
and
gave
him
all
the
friendly
encouragement
,
the
admission
to
be
gallant
,
which
she
had
ever
given
in
the
ﬁrst
and
most
animating
period
of
their
acquaintance
;
but
which
now
,
run

in
her
own
estimation
,
meant
nothing
,
though
in
the
judgment
of
most
people
looking
on
,
it
must
have
had
such
an
appearance
as
no
English
word
but
ﬂimtion
could
very
well
describe
.
“Mr
Frank
Churchill
and
Miss
Woodhause
ﬂirted
together
excedvely.”
They
were
laying
themselves
to
that
very
phrase
—
and
to
having
it
sent

'
in
a
etter
to
Maple
Grove
by
one
lad
,
to
Ireland
by
another
.
Not
that
Emma
was
gay
an
thoughtless
from
any
real
felicity
;
it
was
rather
because
she
felt
less
happy
than
she
had
expected
.
She
laughed
because
the
was
dinppointed
;
and
though
she
liked
him
for
his
attention»
and
thought
them
all
,
whether
in
friendship
,
admiration
,
or
playfulness

extremely
udicious
,
the
were
not
winning
back

heart

She
still
inten

him
for
her
friend
.
“How
much
I
am
obliged
to
you

”
said
he
,
“
for

me

Mr

Emma
,
I
must
once
more
opeak
to
you
as
I
have
been
used
to
do
;
a
privilege
rather
endured
than
allowed
,
perhaps
;
but
I
must
still
use
it

I
can
not

you
acting
wrong

without
a
remonstrance

How
could
you
be
so
unfeeling
to
Miss

How

you
be

imolent
in

to
a

“

me.”
“
I
assure
you
she
did
.
She
felt
your
full
meaning
.
She
has
talked
of
it
since
.
I
wish
you
could
have
heard
how
she
talked
of
it
—
with
what
mndour
and
generosity
.
I
wish
you
could
have
heard
her
honouring
your
forbearance
,
in
being
able
to
pay
her
such
attentions
,
as
the
was
for
ever
receiving
from
yOurself
and
your
father
,
when
her
society
must
be
so
irksome.”
“
Oh
!
"
cried
Emma
,
“
I
know
there
in
not
a
better
creature
in
the
world
;
but
you
must
allow
,
that
what
is
good
and
what
is
ridiculous
are
most
unfortunately
blended
in
her.”
“They
are
blended
,
”
said
he
,
“I
acknowledge
;
and
,
were
the
prosperous
,
I
could
allow
much
for
the
occasional
prevalence
of
the
ridiculous
over
the
good
.
Were
she
a
woman
of
fortune
,
I
would
leave
every
harmless
absurdity
no
take
its
chance
;
I
would
not
quarrel
with
you
for
any
liberties
of
manner
.
Were
she
your
equal
in
situation“
but
,
Emma
,
consider
how
far
Burnt
143
this
in
from
being
the
cate
.
She
is
poor
;
she
has
sunk
from
the
comfom
she
was
born
to
;
and
if
ehe
live
to
old
age
mutt
probably
link
more
.
Her
uituau'on
should
aecure
your
companion
.
It
was
badly
done
,
indeed
!
You
,
whom
she
had
known
from
an
infant
,
whom
she
had
seen
grow
up
from
a
period
when
her
notice
was
an
honour
—
to
have
you
now
,
in
thoughtleu
Ipiritl
,
and
the
pride
of
the
moment
,
laugh
at

before

—
and
before

,

of

(
certainly
more
)
would
be
entirely
guided
bylawtreatmcnt
of
her
.
This
is
not
pleasant
to
you
,
Emma
—
and
it
is
very
far
from
plmnt
to
me
;
but
I
must
,
I
will
—
I
will
tell
you
truths

I

While
they
talked
they
were
advancing
toward
.
the
mrriage
;
it
was
ready
;
and
,
before
she
could
speak
again
,
he
had
handed
her
in
.
He
had
misinterpreted
the
feelings
which
had
kept
her
face
averted
,
and
her
tongue
motionless
.
They
were
combined
only
of
anger
against
herself
,
mortification
,
and
deep
concern
.
She
had
not
.
been
able
to
speak
;
and
,
on
entering
the
carriage
,
sunk
back
for
a
moment
overeome
;
then
reproaching
herself
for
having
taken
no
leave
,
making
no
acknowledgement
,
paru'ng
in
apparent
Iullenness
,
she
looked
out
with
voice
and
hand
eager
to
show
a
difference
;
but
it
was
just
too
late
.
He
had
turned
away
,
and
the
horses
were
in
motion
.
She
continued
to
look
back
,
but
in
vain
;
and
soon
,
with
what
ap
unusual
speed
,
they
were
half
way
down
the
hill
,
and
everything
left
far
behind
.
She
van
vexed
beyond
what
could
have
been
expressed
—
almost
beyond
what
she
could
conceal
.
Never
had
she
felt
so
agitated
,
mortiﬁed
,
grieved
,
at
any
circumstance
in
her
life
.

She

The
truth
of

representation

She
felt
it
at
her
heart
.
How
could
ahe
have
been

brutal

How
could
she
have

herself

And
how
suffer
him
to
leave
her
without

wretchedness
of
a

in
Emma’s
thoughts
all
the
evening
.
How
it
might
be
‘considered
by
the

of
the
party
she
could
not

They
,
in
their
dill'erent
homes
,
and
their
different
ways
,
might
be
looking
back
on
it
with
pleasure
;
but
in
her
View
it
was
a
morning
more
completely

,
more
totally
hare
of
rational
satisfaction
at
the
time
,
and
more
to
he
nbhorred
in
recollection
,
than
any
the
had
ever
passed
.
A
whole
evenin
of
backgammon
with
her
father
was
felicity
to
it
.
T
,
indeed
,
lay
real
pleasure
,
for
there
the
was
giving
up
the
sweetest
hours
of
the
twenty

four

his
comfort
;
and
feeling
that
,
unmerited
as
might
be
the
degree
of
hil
fond
affection
and
conliding
esteem
,
she
could
not
,
in
her
general
conduct
,
be
open
to
any
severe
reproach

EMMA

As
a
daughter
she
hoped
she
was
not
without
a
heart
.
She
hoped
no
one
could
have
said
to
her
,
“
How
could
you
be
so
unfeeling
to
your
father
?
—
—
-I
must
,
I
will
tell
you
truths
while
I
can.”
Miss
Batu
should
never
again
—
mo
never
!
If
attention
in
future
could
do
away
the
past
she
might
hope
to
be
forgiven
.
She
had
been
often
remiss
,
her
conscience
told
her
Io
;
remiss
,
perhaps
,
more
in
thought
than
fact
;
scomful
,
uogmcioua
.
But
it
should
he
so
no
more
.
In
the
warmth
of
true
contrition
she
would
call
upon
her
the
very
next
maming
,
and
it
should
he
the
beginning
.
on
her
side
,
of
a
regular
,
equal
,
kindly
intercourse
.
She
was
just
as
determined
when
the
marrow
came
and
went
early
,
that
nothing
might
revent
her
.
It
was
not
unlikely
,
she
thought
,
that
she
might
see
Mr
Knightley
in
her
way
;
or
perhapa
he
might
come
in
while
she
were
paying
her
visit
.
She
had
no
objection
.
She
would
not
be
ashamed
of
the
appearance
of
the
penitence
,
so
justly
and
truly
hers
.
Her
eyes
were
toward

him
not

“
The
ladies
were
all

She
had
never
Iejoiced
at
the
sound
before
,
nor
ever
before
entered
the
passage
,
nor
walked
up
the
stairs
,
with
any
wish
of
giving
pleasure
,
but
in
conferring
obligation
,
or
of
deriving
it
,
except
in
subsequent
ridicule
.
There

a

of
moving
and

Miss
Bates’s

something
was
to
be
done
in
a

;
the
maid
looked
frightened
and
awkward
;
hoped
she
would
be
pleased
to
wait
a
moment
,
and
then
ushered
her
in
too
soon
.
The
aunt
and
niece
seemed
both
escaping
into
the
ad‘oining
room
.
Jane
the
had
a
distinct
glimpoe
of
,
looking
extremely
ill
;
and
,
before
the
door
had
shut
them
out
,
she
heard
Mia
Bates
saying
,

Emma
seriously
hoped
she
would
.
She
had
a
moment
s
fear
of
Miss
Bates
keeping
away
from
her
.
But
Miss
Bates
soon
came
—
“
Very
happy
and
0in
”
—
—
but
Emma’s
conscience
told
her
that
there
was
not
the
same
cheerﬁrl
volubility
as
before
—
less
ease
of
look
and
manner
.
A
very
friendly
inquiry
after
Miss
Fairfax
,
she
hoped
,
might
lead
the
way
to
a
return
of
old
feelings
.
The
touch
seemed
immediate
.
“
Ah
,
Miss
Woodhouse
,
how
kind
you
are
!
I
suppose
you
have
heard
—
and
are
come
to
give
or
joy
.
This
does
not
seem
much
like
joy
,
indeed
,
in
me”
(
twinkling
away
a
tear
or
two
)
;
“but
it
will
be
very
trying
for
u
:
to
part
with
her
,
after
having
had
her
so
long
;
and
she
has
a

,
as

You

were

at

was

somehow
there
was
a

foritso
happened
that

till

Emma
was
most
sincerely
intereﬁed
.
Her
hrt
had
been
long
growing
kinder
towards
Jane
;
and
this
picture
of
her
present
sufferings
acted
as
a
cure
of
every
former
ungenerous
suspicion
,
and
left
her
nothing
but
pity
;
and
the
remembrance
of
the
less
and
less
gentle
sensations
of
the
past
obliged
her
to
admit
that
ane
might
very
naturally
resolve
on
seeing
Mrs

,
or
any
other
steady
friend
,
when
she
might
not

She
spoke
as

she

it
:
something
happened
before

Mr

The
contrast
between

struck
her
;

was

musing
on
the
difference
of
woman’s
desﬁny
,
and
quite
unconscious
on
what
her
eyes
were
ﬁxed
,
till
roused
by
Miss
Bates
saying
—
“Ay
,
I
see
what
you
are

of

the
pianoforte
.
What
Is

And
to
this

I
do

Now
Emm
was
obliged
to
think
of
the

the
remembrance
of
all
her
former

MMA’S
pensive
meditations
,
as
she
walked
home
,
were
not
interrupted
;
but
on
entering
the
parlour
,
she
found
those
who
must
rouse
her
.
Mr
Knightley
and
Harriet
had
arrived
durin
her
absence
,
and
were
sitting
with
her
father
.
r
Knightley
immediately
got
up
,
and
,
in
a
manner
decidedly
graver
than
usual
,
said
—
“I

”
“
Yes
—

—
I
have
been
thinking
of
it
some
little
time.”
Emma
was
sure
he
had
not
forgiven
her
;
he
looked
unlike
himself
.
Time
,
however
,
she
thought
,
would
tell
him
that
they
ought
to
be

again
.
While
he
stood
,
as
if

to

,

her

began
his
inquiries
.

Dear

Emma’s
colour
was
heightened
by
this
unjust
praise
;
and
with
a
smile
and
shake
of
the
head
,
which
spoke
much
,
she
looked
at
Mr

It
seemed
as
if
there
were

favour

and
in
another
moment
still
more
so
,
by
a
ttle
movement
of
more
than
common
friendliness
on

rt

He
took
her
hand

he
took
her
hand
,
pressed
it
,
and
certainly
was
on
the
point
of
carrying
it
to
his
lips
—
when
,
from
some
fancy
or
other
,
he
suddenly
let
it
go
.
Why
he
should
feel
such
a
scruple
,
why
he
should
change
his
mind
when
it
was
all
but
done
,
she
could
not
rceive
.
He
would
have
judged
better
,
she
thought
,
'
he
had
not
stopped
.
The
intention
,
however
,
was
induhitable
;
and
whether
it
was
that
his
manners
had
in
general
so
little
gallantry
.
or
however
else
it
happened
,
but
she
thought
nothing
became
him
more
.
It
was
with
him
of
so
simple
,
yet
so
digniﬁed
a
nature
.
She
could
not
but
recall
the
attempt
with
great
satisﬁcn'on
.
It
spoke
such
perfect
amity
.
He
left
them
immediately
afterwards
—
gone
in
a
moment
.
He
always
moved
with
the
alertness
of
a
mind
which
could
neither
be
undecided
nor
dilawry
,
but
now
he
seemed
more
sudden
than
usual
in
his
disappearance
.
Emma
could
not
regret
her
having
gone
to
Miss
Bates
,
but
she
wished
she
had
left
her
ten
minutes
earlier
;
—
—
it
would
have
been
a
great
ensure
to
talk
over
Jane

Knightley

Neither
would
she

as
to
the

of

of

her

thoughts
from
the
disagreeableness
of
Mr
Knighdey’s

,
and
going
so
suddenly
,

going
on

,
which
she
knew

communicated
her

Mr

to

on

,
she
had
not

above
six-and-thirty

A

of
a
different
nature
from
anything
foreboded
by

general
state

had
carried
her
off

She

The

all
that
was
immediately
important
of

Mr

was
boner
than

and
their

removal

on

It

to

to
Jane
Fairfax
,
whose

at

with

it

and
the
person
,
whom
she
had

,
was
now
the
very
one
on
whom
she
would
have
lavished
every
distinction

She
resolved

to

A

was
written
to
urge

The

with

the

she

:

everything

unpersuadable

to
make
her
worse

wished
she
could
have
seen

,
and
tried
her
own
powers
;
but
,
almost
before
she
could
hint
the
wish

Miss

made
it

Miss

was
very

,
and
very
communicative
;

would
hardly

Mr

recommended

food
;
but
everything
the
could
command
(
and
never
had
anybody
such
good
neighbours
)
was
distasteful
.
Emma
,
on
reaching
home
,
called
the
housekeeper
directly
to
an
examination
of
her
stores
;
and
some

In
half
an

the

was
returned
,
with
a
thounnd
thankl
from
Miss
Bates
,
but
“
dear
Jane
would
not
be
natislied
without
its
being
out

;
it

a
thing

and
,
moreover

she
insisted
on

saying

heard
that

wandering

at

Emma
s
courage
remmed

she
walked
on

I
was
wrong

he
continued
,
“in
talking
of
its

you

I
should
not

myself

Humph

In

my

there

Emma
found
that
the
must

now
it
required
little
effort
.
She
asked
no

,

employed
her
own

that
soon
pointed
out
to
her

to

Emma
dirtinctly
heard
him
add
,
in

lower
tone
,
before
he
quitted
the

—
“
I

Mrs

looking
so
ill

an
air
of

much

that
Emma’s
uneasiness
increased
:

the

they
were

she
agerly

Mrs

So

a
that

hemmed
Mn

:
“

Emma
even
jumped
with
nil-prise
;
and
,
horror-struck
,
exclaimed
—
“Jane
Fairfax
!
Good
God
!
You
are
not

You
do
not
mean

?
'
“
You
may
well
be
amazed

”
returned
Mra
Weston
,
nil
!
averting
her
eyes
,
and
talking
on
with
eagerness
,
that
Emma
might
have
time
to
recover
—
“
you
may
well
be
amazed
.
But
it
in
even
so
.
There
ha
:
been
a
solemn
engagement
between
them
ever
since
October
—
formed
at
Weymouth
,
and
kept
a
secret
from
everybody
.
Not
a
creature
knowing
it

themselves
—
neither
the
Campbells
,
nor
her

,
nor
his

in

wonderful

though
perfectly
convinced
of

fact

it
it
yet
almost
incredible
to
mytelf
.
I
can
hardly
believe
it

I
thought
I
knew
him.”
Emma
scarcely
heard
what
was
said
.
Her
mind
was
divided
between
two
ideas
;
her
own
former
convenathan
:
with
him
about
Miss
Fairfax
,
and
poor
Harriet
;
and
for
some
time
she
could
only
exclaim
,
and
require
conﬁrmation
,
ted
conﬁrmation

“Well
!
”
said
she
at
last
,
1
ing
to
recover
herself
,
“this
is
a
circumstance
which
must
think
of
at
least
half
a
day
before
I
can
at
all
comprehend
it

What

hurt
me
,
Emma
,
very
much
.
It
has
hurt
his
father
equally
.
Some
par
!
of
his
conduct
we
can
not
excuse.”
Emma
pondered
a.
moment
,
and
then
replied
:
—
“I
will
not
pretend
no
!
to
understand
you
;
and
to
give
an
all
the
relief
in
my
power
,
be
assured
that
no
such
e
t
has
followed
his
attentionto
me
as
you
are
apprehensive
of
.
'
Mn
Weston
looked
up
,
afraid
to
believe
;
but
Emma’s
countenance
was
as
steady
as
her
words
.
“That
you
may
have
less
diﬂiculty
in
believing
this
boast
of
my
present
perfect
indifference
,
”
the
continued
,
“
I
will
farther
tell
you
,
that
there
was
a
period
in
the
early
part
of
our
acquaintance
when
I
did
like
him
—
when
I
was
very
much
disposed
to
be
amehed
to
him
;
nay
,
was
attached
—
and
how
it
came
to
cease
isyerhaps
the
wonder
.
Fortunately
,
however
,
it
did
ease
.
I
have
really
for
some
time
past
—
for
at
least
these
three
months
—
ﬁred
nothing
about
him
.
You
may
believe
me
,
Mrs
Weston
.
This
is
the
simple
truth.”
Mrs
Weston
kind
her
with
tears
of
joy
;
and
when
she
could
ﬁnd
utterance
,
amured
her
that
this
protestation
had
done
her
more
good
than
anything
else
in
the
world
could
do
.
“Mr
Weston
will
be
almost
as
much
relieved
as
myself
,
”
said
she
.
“
On
this
point
we
have
been
wretched
.
It
was
our
darling
wish
that
you
might
be
attached
to
each
other
,
and
we
were
pemaded
that
it
was
so
.
Imagine
what
we
have
been
feeling
on
your
account
.
'
“I
have
escaped
;
and
that
I
shouldesca
maybe
:
matter
of
grateful
wonder
to
you
and
myse
.
But
this
does
not
acquit
bin
,
Mrs
Weston
;
and
I
must
say
that
I
think
him
greatly
to
blame
.
What
right
had
he
to
come
among
us
with
affection
and
faith
engaged
,
and
with
manner
:
so
every
disengaged
?
What
right
had
he
to
endeavour
to
please
,
“
he
certainly
did
—
to
distinguish

any
one
onng
woman
with
pernevering
mention
,
as
he
certainlyzlid
,
while
he
really
belonged
to
another
?
How
could
he
tell
what
milchief
he
might
be
doing
?
How
could
he
tell
that
he
might
not
be
making
me
in
love
with
him
?
Very
wrong
,
very
wrong
,
indeed
.
'
“From
something
that
he
said
,
my
dear
Emma
,
I
rather
imagine
—
—
”
“And
how
could
the
hear
such
behaviour
?
Compoeure
with
a
witness
!
to
look
on
,
while
attentions
were
oﬂ'ering
to
another
woman
before
her
face
,
and
not
recent
it
.
That
is
a
degree
of
placidity
which
I
can
neither
comprehend
nor
respect.”
"
There
were
mixrmdemandin
between
them
,
Emma
;
he
said
so
expressly
.
e
had
not
time
to
enter
into
much
explanation
.
He

:
here
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
in
a
state
of
agitation
which
did
not
allow
the
full
use
even
of
the
time
he
could
stay
—
but
that
there
had
been
misunderstandings
,
he
decidedly
laid
.
The
present
crisis
,
indeed
,
seemed
to
be
brought
on
by
them
;
and
those
misunderstandings
might
very
possibly
arise
from
the
impropriety
of
his
conduct
.
'
“Impropriety
!
0h
!
Mrs
Weston
,
it
is
too
calm
in
censure
.
Much
,
much
beyond
impropriety
!
It
has
sunk
him
—
I
can
not
say
how
it
has
sunk
him
in
my
opinion
.
So
unlike
what
a
man
should
be
!
None
of
that
upright
integrity
,
that
strict
adherence
to
truth
and
principle
,
that
diadain
of
trick
and
littleness
,
which
lalf
man
should
display
in
every
transaction
of
his
e.”
“
Nay
,
dear
Emma
,
now
I
must
take
his
part
;
for
though
he
has
been
wrong
in
this
instance
,
I
have
known
him
long
enough
to
answer
for
his
having
many
,
very
many
good
qualities
;

“

Emma

not
attending
to
her
,
“

horrible
indelicacy

!

“
He
knew
nothing
about
it
,
Emma
.
On
this
article
I
can
frilly
acquit
him
.
It
was
a
private
resolution
of
hen
,
not
commuuimted
to
him
,
or
at
least
not
communicated
in
a
w
:
to

conviction

burst
on
him
,
I
do
not
know
how
,
but
by
some
letter
or
message
—
and
it
was
the
discovery
of
what
she
was
doing
,
of
this
very
project
of
hers
,
which
determined
him
to
come
forward
at
once
,
own
it
all
to
his
uncle
,
throw
himself
on
his
kindness
,
and
,
in
short
,
put
an
end
to
the
miserable
state
of
concealment
that
had
been
carrying
on
so
long
.
'
Emma
began
to
listen
better
.
“
I
am
to
hear
from
him
soon
,
'
continued
Mrs
Weston.
"
He
told
me
at
parting
that
he
should
soon
write
;
and
:
he
spoke
in
a
manner
which
seemed
to
promise
me
many
particulars
that
could
not
be
given
now
.
Let
us
wait
,
therefore
,
for
this
letter
.
It
may
bring
many
extenuations
.
It
may
make
many
things
intelligible
and
excusable
which
now
are
not
to
be
understood
.
Don’t
let
us
be
severe
;
don’t
let
us
be
in
a
hurry
to
condemn
him
.
Let
us
have
patience
.
I
must
love
him
;
and
now
that
I
am
satisﬁed
on
one
point
,
the
one
material
point
,
I
am
sincerely
anxious
for
its
all
turning
out
well
,
and
rudyto
hope
that
it
may

They
must
both
have
suffered
a
great
deal
under
such
a
system
of
secrecy
and

“Hi

replied
Emma

dryly
,
“

not
appear
to
have
done
him
much
harm

and
how
did
Mr
Churchill
take
it

“
Most

for

Emma

would

Thil
was
settled

at

He
stopped
at

at
the
Bates’n

I
fancy
,
some
time
,
and
then
came
on
hither
;
but
was
in
such
a

a

He
was
very
much
agitated
—
very
much
indeed
—
to
a
degree
that
made
him
appear
quite
a
different
creature
from
anything
I
had
ever
seen
him
before
.
In
addition
to
all
the
rest
,
there
had
been
the
shock
of
ﬁnding
her
so
very
unwell
,
which
he
had
had
no
previous
nupicion
of
,
and
there
was
every
apparance
of
his
having
been

great
duh”
“And

aﬁ‘air

Emma
could
not
speak
the
name
of
Dixon
without
a
little
blush
.
“None

not

He
positively
said
that

“

Emma
,

suppose
we
shall
gradually
grow
reconciled
to
the
idea

I

But
I
shall
always
think

anything
of

other
which
both
might
not
have
heard.”
"
You
are
in
luck
.
Your
only
blunder
was
conﬁned
to
my
ear
,
when
you
imagined
a
certain
friend
of
ours
in
love
with
the

“True

I
have
always
had
a
thoroughly
good
opinion
of
Mine
Fairfax
,
I
never
could

spoken
ill
of
her
;
and
as
to
speaking
'
of
him
,
there
I
must
have
been
cafe.”
At
thin
moment
Mr
Weston
appeared
at
a
little
distance
from
the
window
,
evidently
on
the
watch
.
Hie
wife
gave
him
a
look
which
invited
him
in
;
and
,
while
he
was
coming
round
,
added
—
“
Now
,
dearest
Emma
,
let
me
entreat
you
to
say
and
look
everything
that
may
let
his
heart
at
cane
,
and
incline
him
to
be
satisﬁed
with
the
match
.
Let
us
make
the
bent
of
it
—
and
,
indeed
,
almost
everything
may
be
fairly
aid
in
her
favour
.
It
in
not
a
connexion
to
grau'fy
;
but
if
Mr
Churchill
does
not
feel
that
,
why
nhould
we
?
and
it
may
be
a
very
fortunate
circumnanoe
for
him
—
for
Frank
,
I
mean
—
that
he
should
have
attached
himself
to
a
girl
of
such
steadiness
of
character
and
good
jud
ment
as
I
have
always
given
her
credit
for
,
and
still
am
'
to
give
her
credit
for
,
in
spite
of
thin
one
great
deviation
from
the
strict
rule
of
right
.
And
how
much
maybe
laid
,
in
her
eituation
,
for
even
that
error
!

“Much
,
indeed
!
”
cried
Emma
,
feelingly
.
“If
a
woman
can‘ever
be
excused
for
thinking
only
of

,
it
is
in
a
situation
like
Jane

Of
ouch
,
one
may
alwayu
n
,
that
‘
the

not

,
nor
the
world’s
law.’
’
She
met
Mr
Weston
on
his
entrance
with
a
smiling
countenance
,
exclaiming
—
“A
very
pretty
trick
you
havebeen
playing

,

!

,
I

I

you

,
instead
of
its
being

it

out

be

I
congrauilate
you

with

heart
,
on
the
prospect
of
having
one
of
the
most
I
x

lovley
and
accompliohed
young
women
in
England
for
‘
your
daughter.”
A
glance
or
two
between
him
and
hit
wife
convinced
him
that
all
was
a
:
right
as
this
speech
proclaimed
;
and
in
happy
eﬁ'ecton
his
spirits
was
immediate

Hie
air
and
voice
recovered
their
usual
briakneu
;
he
chock
her
heartily
and
grateﬁilly
by
the
hand
,
and
entered
on
the
Iubject
in
a
manner
to
prove
that
he
now
only
wanted
time
and
perwaoion
to
think
the
engagement
no
very
bad
thing
.
His
companions
suggested
only
what
could
palliate
or
Imooth
objections
;
and
by
the
time
they
had
talked
it
all
over
together
,
and
he
bad
talked
it
all
over
again
with
Emma
,
in
their
walk
back
to
Hartlield

he
was
become
perfectly
reconciled

and
not
far
from
thinking
it
the

best
thing
that
Frank
could
possibly
have
done

“
ARRIET
,
poor
Harrietl”
—
-Thooe
were
the
words
;
in
them
lay
the
tormenting
ideas
which
Emma
could
not
get
rid
of
,
and
which
constituted
theoreal
misery
of
the
Maine“
to
her
.
Frank
Churchill
had
behaved
very
ill
by
herself
—
very
ill
in
many
ways
—
hut
it
was
not
so
much
Li
:
behaviour
as
her
own
which
made
her
so
angry
with
him
.
It
was
the
scrape
which
he
had
drawn
her
into
0n
Haniet’s
account
,
that
gave
the
deepest
hue
to
his
offence
—
Poor
Harriet
!
to
be
a
second
time
the
dupe
of
her
misconceptions
and
ﬂattery
.
Mr
Knightley
had
spoken
prophetically
,
when
he
once
said
,
“
Emma
,
you
have
been
no
friend
to
Harriet
Srnith.”
—
She
was
afraid
she
had
done
her
nothing
but
disservice
—
It
was
true
that
she
had
not
to
charge
herselfin
this
inmnce
,
as
in
the
former
,
with
being
the
sole
and
original
author
of
the
mischief
:
with
having
suggested
such
feelings
as
might
otherwise
never
have
entered
Harriet’s
imagimﬁon
;
for
Harriet
had
acknowledged
her
admiration
and
preference
of
Frank
Churchill
before
she
had
evergiven
hers
hint
on
the
subject
;
but
she
felt
complewa
guilty
of
having
encouraged
what
she
might
have
rapressed
.
She
might
have
prevented
the
indulgence
and
increase
of
such
sentiments
.
Her
inﬂuence
would
have
been
enough
.
And
now
she
was
very
conscious
that
she
ought
to
have
prevented
them
—
She
felt
that
she
had
been
risking
her
friend’s
happiness
on
most
insufﬁcient
grounds
.
Common
sense
would
have
directed
her
to
tell
Harriet
that
she
must
not
allow
herself
to
think
of
him
,
and
that
there
were
ﬁve
hundred
chances
to
one
against
his
ever
caring
for
her
.
—
“
But
with
common
sense
,
'
she
added
,
“
I
am
afraid
I
have
had
little
to
do

I

EMMA
.
She
was
extreme
angry
with
herself
.
If
Ihe
could
not
have
been
angry
with
Frank
Churchill
too
,
it
would
have
been
dreadful
.
As
for
Jane
Fairfax
.
she
might
at
least
relieve
her
feelings
from
any
present
solicitude
on
her
account
.
Harriet
would
he
anxiety
enough
;
she
need
no
longer
be
unhappy
about
Jane
,
whose
troubles
and
whose
ill
health
having
,
of
course
,
the
same
origin
,
must
be
equally
under
cure
—
Her
days
of
insigniﬁcance
and
evil
were
oven
—
She
would
soon
be
well
,
and
happy
and
prospemua
—
Emma
could
now
imagine
why
her
own
attentions
had
been
slighted
.
This
discovery
laid
many
smaller
matters
open
.
No
doubt
it
had
been
from
jealousy
—
In
Jane’s
eyes
she
had
been
a
riwl
;
and
well
might
anything
she
could
offer
of
assiatance
or
regard
be
repulsed
.
An
airing
in
the
Hatﬁeld
can'iage
would
have
been
the
rack
,
and
arrowroot
from
the
Hartﬁeld
store-mom
must
have
been
poison
.
She
understood
it
all
;
and
as
far
as
her
mind
oould
disengage
itself
from
the
injustice
and
selﬁahness
of
angry
feelings
,
she
acknowledged
that
Jane
Fairfax
would
have
neither
elevation
nor
happiness
beyond
her
desert
.
But
poor
Harriet
was
such
an
engrossing
charge
!
There
was
little
sympathy
to
be
spared
for
anybody
else
.
Emma
was
nadly
fearful
that
this
second
disappointment
would
be
more
more
than
the
ﬁrst
.
Considering
the
very
superior
claim
of
the
object
,
it
ought
;
and
judging
by
in
apparently
stronger
effect
on
Harriet’s
mind
,
producing
reserve
and
self-command
,
it
would
—
She
must
communicate
the
painful
truth
,
however
,
and
as
soon
as
ssible
.
An
injunction
of
secrecy
had
been
among
r
Weaton’s
parting
words
.
“For
the
present
the
whole
affair
was
to
be
completelya
secret
.
Mr
Churchill
had
made
a
point
of
it
,
as
a
token
of
respect
to
the
wife
he
had
so
very
recently
lost
;
and
everybody
admitted
it
to
be
no
more
than
due
decorum.”
—
Emma
had
promised
;
but
still
Harriet
must
be
excepted
.
It
was
her
superior
duty
.
EMMA

!

In
spite
of
her
vexation
,
the
could
not
help
feeling
it
almost
ridiculous
,
that
she
should
have
the
very
same
dimeuing
and
delicane
ofﬁce
to
perform
by
Harriet
which
Mrs
Weston
had
just
gone
through
by
herself
.
The
intelligence
,
which
had
been
no
anxioully
announced
to
her
,
she
was
now
to
he
anxiously
announcing
to
another
.
Her
heart
beat
quick
on
hearing
Harriet’a
footrtzp
and
voice
;
no

supposed

poor
Mrs

But
of
that
,
unfomrnahely
,
there
could
be
no
chance
.
“Well

Woodhousc

cried
Harriet
,
coming
eagerly
into
the
room
,
"
in
not
this
the
oddest
news
that
ever
was
?
“
What
new
do
you

replied
Emma
,
unable
to
guess
,
by
look
or
voice
,
whether
Harriet
could
indeed
have
received
any
hint
.
“
About
Jane

Did
you
ever

Oh

“What

tell

said
Emma
,
still
perplexed

Harriet
was
atanding
at

of

Emma

round
to

in

haatily
laid

“

she

to

Harriet
had
been
conscious
of
a
difference
in
his
behaviour
ever
since
those
two
decisive
dances
.
Emma
knew
that
he
had
,
on
that
occasion
,
found
her
much
mnerior
to
his
expectation
.
From
that
evening
,
or
at
lent
from
the
time
of
Miss
Woodhouse’s
encouraging
he
:
to
think
of
him
,
Harriet
had
begun
to
be
sensible
of
his
talking
to
her
much
more
than
he
had
been
used
to
lo
,
and
of
his
having
,
indeed
,
quim
a
different
manner
towards
her
;
—
a
manner
of
kindness
and
sweetness
.
Laterly
,
she
had
been
more
and
more
aware
of
it
.
When
they
had
been
all
walking
together
,
he
had
so
often
come
and
walked
by
her
,
and
talked
so
very
deligxtﬁillyl
—
He
seemed
to
want
to
be
acquainted
with
her
.
Emma
knew
it
to
have
been
very
much
the
case
:
she
had
often
observed
the
change
,
to
almost
the
same
extent
.
Harriet
repeated
expressions
of
approbation
md
praise
from
him
—
and
Emma
felt
them
to
be
in
tle
closest
agreement
with
what
she
had
known
of
his
)
pinion
of
Harriet
.
He
praised
her
for
being
witlnut
art
or
affectation
;
for
having
simple
,
honest
,
generous
feelings
.
She
knew
that
he
saw
such
recommendations
in
Han'iet
;
he
had
dwelt
on
them
to
her
nore
than
once

but
the
two

occurrences
to
he
mentioned
—
the
two
of
strongest
promise
to
Harriet
—
were
not
without
some
degree
of
witness
from
Emma
herself
.
The
ﬁrst
was
his
walking
with
her
apart
from
the
ohers
in
the
lime-walk
at
Donwell
,
w
ere
they
had
h-en

hadtakenpainc
(

todnw
her
from
the
rest
to
himself
;
and
at
ﬁrst
he
had
talked
to
her
in
a
more
particular
way
than
he
had
ever
done
before
—
in
a
very
particular
way
indeed
l
—
(
Harriet
could
not
recall
it
without
a
blush
.
)
He
seemed
to
be
almoat
asking
her
whether
her
affections
were
engaged
.
But
as
noon
on
the
(
Miss
Womlhounc
)
appeared
likely
to
join
them
,
he
changed
the
subject
,
and
began
mlkng
about
farming
.
The
second
wan
his
having
at
talking
with
her
nearly
half
an
hour
before
Emma
came
lack
from
her
visit
,
the
very
last
morning
of
his
being
at
Hartlield
—
—
though
,
when
he
ﬁm
came
in
,
he
had
said
that
he
could

and
his
having
told
her
,
during
their
conversation
,
that

to

,
it
was
very
much
against
his
inclination
that
he
left
home
at
all
,
which
was
much
more
(
as
Enma
felt
)
than
he
had
acknowledged
to
liar
.
The
luptrior
degree
of
conﬁdence
towards
Harriet
which
this
one
article
marked
gave
her
severe
in

,
she
did

after

When
Harriet
had
closed
her
evidence
,
the
appealel
to
her
dear
Min
Woodhouee
to
naywhethershehal
not
good
ground
for

The
bitter
feelings
occasioned
by
this
speech
,
the
many
bitter
feelings
,
made
the
utmost
exertion
necessary
on
Emma’s
side
to
enable
her
to
say
on
ly
—
—
“Hnn'iet
,
I
will
only
venture
to
Clem
'
,
that
Mr
Knightley
is
the
last
man
in
the
world
who
would
intentionally
give
any
woman
the
idea
of
his
feeling
for
her
more
than
he
really
does.”
Harriet
seemed
ready
to
worship
her
friend
for
a
sentence
so
satisfactory
;
and
Emma
was
only
saved
from
ruptures
and
fondness
,
which
at
that
moment
would
have
been
dreadful
penance
,
by
the
sound
of
her
father’s
footsteps
.
He
was
coming
through
the
hall
.
Harriet
was
too
much
agitated
to
encounter
him
.
“
She
could
not
compose
herself
—
Mr
Woodhouse
would
be
alarmed
—
she
had
better
go
;
”
—
-with
most
ready
encouragement
from
her
friend
.
therefore
,
she
passed
off
through
another
door
—
and
the
moment
she
was
gone
,
this
was
the
ntaneons
burst
of
Emma’s
feelings
:
—
-“
O
God
I
that
had
never
seen
her
!
”
The
rest
of
the
day
,
the
following
night
,
were
hardly
enough
for
her
thoughts
.
She
was
bewildered
amidst
the
confusion
of
all
that
had
rushed
on
her
within
the
last
few
hours
.
Every
moment
had
brought
a
fresh
surprise
;
and
every
surprise
must
be
matter
of
humiliation
to
her
.
How
to
understand
it
all
!
How
to
understand
the
deceptions
she
had
been
thus
practising
on
herself
,
and
living
under
!
The
blunders
,
the
blindness
of
her
own
head
and
heart
!
She
sat
still
,
she
walked
about
,
she
tried
her
own
room
,
she
tried
the
shrubbery
—
in
every
place
,
every
posture
,
she
perceived
that
she
had
acted
most
weakly
;
that
she
had
been
imposed
on
by
others
in
a
most
mortifying
degree
;
that
she
had
been
imposing
on
herself
in
a
degree
more
mortifying
;
that
she
was
wretched
,
and
shoal
probably
ﬁnd
this
day
but
the
beginning
of
wretchedness
.

thoroughly
undemand
her

Wu
the
lint
endeavour
.
To
that
point
went
every
leisure
moment
which
her
father’s
claims
on
her
allowed
,
and
every
moment
of
involuntary
absence
of
mind
.
How
long
had
Mr
Knightley
been
so
dmr
to
her
,
as
every
feeling
declared
him
now
to
be
?
When
had
his
inﬂuence
,
such
inﬂuence
begun
?
When
had
he
rucceeded
to
that
place
in
her
affection
which
Frank
Churchill
had
once
,
for
a
short
period
,
occupied
?
—
She
looked
back
;
she
compared
the
two
—
compared
them
,
as
they
had
alwa
s
stood
in
her
estimation
,
from
the
time
of
the
latter’s
coming
known
to
her
—
and
as
they
must
at
any
time
have
been
compared
by
her
,
had
it
—
oh
!
had
it
,
by
any
blessed
Felicity
,
occurred
to
her
to
institute
the
comparison
.
She
saw
that
there
never
had
been
a
time
when
she
did
not
consider
Mr
Knightley
as
inﬁnitely
the
superior
,
or
when
his
regard
for
her
had
not
been
inﬁnitely
the
moat
dear
.
She
saw
,
that
in
persuading
herself
,
in
fancying
,
in
acting
to
the
contrary
,
she
had
been
entirely
under
a
delusion
,
totally
ignorant
of
her
own
heart
—
and
,
in
short
,
that
the
had
never
mlly
cared
for
Frank
Churchill
at
all
!
This
was
the
conclusion
of
the
ﬁrst
series
of
[
reﬂections
]
.
Thin
was
the
knowledge
of
herself
,
on
the
lint
qmmion
of
inquiry
,
which
she
reached
;
and
without
being
long
in
reaching
it
.
She
was
most
sorrowfully
indignant
;
ashamed
of
every
sensation
but
the
one
revealed
to
her
—
her
affection
for
Mr
Knightley
.
Every
other
part
of
her
mind
was
disgusting
.
With
insufferable
vanity
had
she
believed
herself
in
the
secret
of
everybody'a
feelings
;
with
unpardonahle
arrogance
proposed
to
arrange
eve
body’s
destiny
.
She
wan
proved
to
have
been
universal
y
mistaken
;
and
she
had
not
quite
done
nothing
—
for
the
had
done
mischief
.
She
had
brought
evil
on
Harriet
,
on
herself
,
EMMA
.
183
and
,
she
too
much
feared
,
on
Mr
Knightley
.
Were
this
most
on
ual
of
all
connections
to
take
place
,
on
her
must
rest
the
reproach
of
having
given
it
a
beginning
;
for
his
attachment
she
must
believe
to
be
produced
only
by
a
consciousness
of
Harriet’s
;
—
snd
even
were
this
not
the
case
,
he
would
never
have
known
Harriet
at
all
but
for
her
folly
.
Mr
Knightley
and
Harriet
Smith
l
—
It
was
an
union
to
distance
every
wonder
of
the
kind
.
The
attachment
of
Frank
Churchill
and
Jane
Fairfax

commonplace
,
threadbare
,
stale
in
the
com
rison
,
exciting
no

to

he

every

had
shown
how

was

Such

She

well
of

was
more

she
loved
him
very

She
talked
with

she

fumished
Emma
with

reﬂection

by
increasing
her
esteem

compassion
,

The
weather
affected
Mr

;
and
he
could
only
be
kept
tolerany
comfortable
by
almost

attention

:
side
,
and
by
exertion
:
which
had
never
coat
her
half
to
much
before
.
It
reminded
her
of
their
ﬁrst
forlorn
the
—
‘a-tete
,
on
the
evening
of
Mn
Weston'a
weddingday
;
but
Mr
Knightley
had
walked
in
then
,
soon
after
tea
,
and
dissipated
every
melancholy
fancy
.
Alas
!
ouch
delightful
proofs
of
Hartﬁeld’a
attraction
,
an
those
sort
of
visita
conveyed
,
might
uhortly
be
over
.
The
picture
which
she
had
then
drawn
of
the
privatiom
of
the
approaching
winter
had
proved
erroneous
;
no
friends
had
deserted
them
,
no
pleaturea
had
been
lost
.
But
her
present
forebodings
the
feared
would
experience
no
similar
contradiction
.
The
pmpect
before
her
now
wan
threatening
to
a
degree
that
could
not
be
entirely
diqrclled—
that
might
not
be
even
partially
brightened
.
If
all
took
place
that
might
take
ace
among
the
circle
of
her
friends
,
Hartﬁeld
must
comparatively
deserted
;
and
she
left
to
cheer
her
father
with
the
spirita
only
of
ruined
happinest
.
The
child
to
be
born
at
Randall
:
must
be
a
tie
there
even
dearer
than
hemlf
;
and
Mn
Weston’s
heart
and
time
would
be
occupied
by
it
.
They
should
lose
her
;
and
probably
,
in
great
more
,
her
husband
also
.
Frank
Churchill
would
return
among
them
no
more
;
and
Miss
Fairfax
,
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose
,
would
noon
ceaae
to
belong
to
Highbury

They
would
be
married
,
and
settled
either
at
or
near
Enacombe

All
that
were
good
would
be
withdrawn

they
were
together

The
“Haw-d’ye-do'l
"
were
quiet
and
constrained
on
each
tide
.
She
asked
after
their
mutual

;
they
were
all
well
.
When
had

She
thought
he
was
often
looking
at
her
,
and
trying
for
a
fuller
View
of
her
face
than
it
suited
her
to

And
thibelief
produced
another
dread
.
Perhaps

—

“

After
waiting
a
moment
,
as
if
to
be
sure
she
intended
to
as
no

,
he
replied
—
“lf

,
I
have

almdy.”
“How
is
it
possible
?
'
cried
Emma
,
turning
her
glowing
cheeks
towards
him
;
for
,
while
she
spoke
,
it
occurred
to
her
that
he
might
have
called
at
Mrs
Goddard
s
in
his
way
.
“I
had
a
few
lines
on
parish
business
from
Mr
Weston
this
morning
,
and
at
the
end
of
them
he
gave
me
a
brief
account
of
what
had
happened
.
'
Emma
was
quite
relieved
,
and
could
presently
say
,
with
a
little
more
composure
—
“
You
probably
have
been
less
surprised
than
any
of
us
,
for
you
have
had
your
suspicions
.
I
have
not
forotten
that
you
once
tried
to
give
me
a
caution

I

it

(
with
a
linking
voice
and
a
heavy
sigh
)
“
I
seem
to
have
been
doomed
to
blindness
.
'
For
a
moment
ortwo
nothing
was
said
,
and
she
was
unluspicions
of
having
excited
any
particular
interest
,
till
she
found
her
arm
drawn
within
his
,
and
pressed
against
his
heart
,
and
heard
him
thus
mying
,
in
a
tone
of
great
sensibility
,
speaking
low
—
“
Time

excellent
sense
;
your

:
I
know
you
will
not
allow

"
Her
arm
was
ressed
again
,
as
he
added
,
in
a
more
broken
and
cu
ued
accent
,
“The
feelings
of

And
in

could
recover
from
the

of

excited
by

cried

with

;

at

I

Emma
was
almost
ready
to
link
under
the
agitation
of
tln'a
moment
.
The
dread
of
being
awakened
from
the
happiest
dream
was
perhapa
the
most
prominent
feeling
.
“
I
can
not
make

Emma
,
”
he
noon
renamed
,
and
in
a
tone
of
much
sincere
,
decided
,
intelligible
tenderneta
as
was
tolerany
convincing
.
“If
I
loved
you

,
I
might
be
able
to
talk

it
more
.
But
you
know
what
I

You

nothing

truth
from

.

and
lectured

,
and
you

a
no
other
woman
in
England
would
have

Bear
with
the
truth
:
I
would
tell
you
now
,
dearest
Emma
,
an

The
manner
,
perhaps
may

ah
only

hear
—
once
to
hear
your
voice.”
While
he
spoke
,
Emma’s
mind
was
most
busy
,
and
,
with
all
thewonderful
velocity
of
thought
,
had
been
EKMA
.
20
!
ablHnd
yet
without
losing
a
word
—
to
catch
and
comprehend
the
exact
truth
of
the
whole
;
to
see
that
Harriet’s
hopes
had
been
entirely
groundless
,
a
mistake
,
a
delusion
,
as
complete
a
delusion
as
any
of
her
own
—
that
Harriet
was
nothing
;
that
she
was
everythin
herself
;
that
what
she
had
been
saying
relative
to
arriet
had
been
all
taken
as
the
language
of
her
own
feelings
;
and
that
her
agitaﬁon
,
her
doubts
,
her
reluctance
,
her
discouragement
,
had
been
all
received
as
discouragement
from
herself
.
And
not
only
was
there
time
for
these
convictions
,
with
all
their
glow
of
attendant
happiness
,
there
was
time
also
to
rejoice
that
Harriet’s
secret
had
not
escaped
her
,
and
to
resolve
that
it
need
not
,
and
should
not
.
It
was
all
the
service
she
could
now
render
her
poor
friend
;
for
as
to
any
of
that
heroism
of
sentiment
which
might
have
prompted
her
to
entreat
him
to
transfer
his
affection
from
herself
to
Harriet
,
as
inﬁnitely
the
most
worthy
of
the
two
—
—
or
even
the
more
simple
sublimity
of
resolving
to
refuse
him
at
once
and
for
ever
,
without
vouchmﬁng
any
motive
because
he
could
not
marry
them
both
,
Emma
had
it
not
.
She
felt
for
Harriet
,
with
pain
and
with
contrition
;
but
no
ﬂight
of
generosity
run
mad
,
opposing
all
that
could
be
probable
or
reasonable
,
entered
her
brain
.
She
had
led
her
friend
astray
,
and
it
would
be
a
reproach
to
her
for
ever
;
but
her
judgment
was
as
strong
as
her
feelings
,
and
as
strong
as
it
had
ever
been
before
,
in
reprobating
any
such
alliance
for
him
,
as
most
unequal
and
degrading
.
Her
way
was
clear
,
though
not
quite
smooth
.
She
fete
then
,
on
being
so
entreated
.
What
did
she
say
?
ust
what
she
ought
,
of
course
.
A
lady
always
does
.
She
said
enough
to
show
there
need
not
be
despair
—
and
to
invite
him
to
say
more
himself
.
He
bad
despaired
at
one
period
;
he
had
received
such
an
injunction
to
caution
and
silence
,
as
for
the
time
crushed
every
hope
—
-she
had
begun
by
refusing
to
hear
him

had
been
a
long-tunding
jealouIy
,
old
as
the
arrival
,
or
even
the
expectation
,
of
Frank
Churchill
.
He
had
been
in

with

,
and
jealous
of
Frank
Churchill
,
from
about
the
same
period
,
one
sentiment
having
probably
enlightened
him
II
to
the

.
It
was
his
jealousy
of
Frank
Churchill
that
had
taken
him
from

The

had
decided
him
on

would
save
himself
from

again
such

attentions
.
He
had
gone
to
lam
to
be
indifferent
.
But
he
had
gone
to
a
wrong
place
.
There
wan
too
much
domestic
happiness
in
llll
brother’s
house
;
woman
wore
too
amiable
a
form
in
it
;
Inabella
was
too
much
like
Emma
—
dilfcring
only
in
those
striking
inferioritiee
which
always
brought
the
other
in
brilliancy
before
him
,
for
much
to
have
been
done
even
had
his
time
been
longer
.
He
had
stayed
on
,
however
,
vigorously
,
da
alter
day
—
till
this

had
Conny
the

.
Then
,
with
the
gladnesa
which
muat

,
nay
,
which
he
did
not

,
having
never

,
wan
there
to
much
fond
solicitude
,
so
much
keen
anxiety
for
her
,
tlnrt
he
could
on
no
longer
.
He
had
ridden
home
through
the
min
;
and
had
walked
up
directly
after

,
to

how
thin
Iweetett

He

her
agitated
and
low
.
Frank
Churchill
was
a
villain
.
He
heard
her
declare
that
Ihe
had
never

Frank
Churchill’o
character
was
not
desperate
.
She
was
his

Emma
,
by
hand

,
when
they

must
have
some
alloy
.
Her
father
—
and
Harriet
.
She
could
not
be
alone
without
feeling
the
full
weight
of
their
sepaﬂte
claims
;
and
how
to
guard
the
comfort
of
both
to
the
utmost
was
the
question
.
With
respect
to
her
father
,
it
was
a
question
soon
answered
.
She
hardly
knew
yet
what
Mr
Knightley
would
ask
;
but
a
very
short
parley
with
her
own
heart
produced
the
mast
solemn
resolution
of
never
quitting
her
father
.
She
even
wept
over
the
idea
of
it
,
as
a
sin
of
thought
.
While
he
lived
,
it
must
be
only
an
engagement
;
but
she
ﬂattered
herself
,
that
if
divested
of
the
danger
of
drawing
her
away
,
it
might
become
an
increase
of
comfort
to
him
.
How
to
do
her
best
by
Harriet
was
of
more
difﬁcult
decision
;
how
to
spare
her
from
any
unnecesury
pain
;
how
to
make
her
any
possible
atonement
;
how
to
a
r
least
her
enemy
?
On
these
suh'ects
her
perp
exity
and
distress
were
very
great
—
an
her
mind
had
to
pass
again
and
again
through
every
hitter
reproach
and
sorrowful
regret
that
had
ever
surrounded
it
.
She
could
only
resolve
at
last
that
she
would
will
avoid
a
meeting
with
her
.
and
communicate
all
that
need
be
told
by
letter
;
that
it
would
be
inexpressibly
desirable
to
have
her
removed
just
now
for
a
time
from
Highbury
,
and
—
indulging
in
one
scheme
more
—
nearly
resolve
that
it
might
be
practicable
to
get
an
invitation
for
her
to
Brunswick
S
uare
.
Isabella
had
been
pleased
with
Harriet
;
and
a
w
weeks
spent
in
London
must
give
her
some
amusement
.
She
did
not
think
it
in
Harriet’l
nature
to
escape
being
beneﬁted
by
novelty
and
variety
,
by
the
streets
,
the
shops
,
and
the
children
.
At
any
rate
,
it
would
be
a
proof
of
attention
and
kindness
in
herself
,
from
whom
everything
was
due
;
a
separation
for
the
present
;
an
averting
of
the
evil
day
,
when
they
must
all
be
together
again
.
She
rose
early
,
and
wrote
her
letter
to
Harriet
;

to

and
here
I
an
)
conscious
of
wrong
,
for
that
visit
might

paid
,
You
will
look
back
,
and
see
that
I
did
not
come
till
Miss
Fairfax
was
in
Highbury
;
and
as
you
were
the
person
nlighted
,
you
will
forgive
me
instantly
;
but
I
must
work
on
my
father‘s
compassion
,
by
remrnding
him
,
that
so
long
as
I
absented
myself
from
his
house
,
so
long
I
lost
the
blessing
of
knowing
you
.
My
behaviour
,
during
the
very
happy
lbrtnight
which
I
spent
with
you
,
did
not
,
I
hope
,
lay
me
open
to
reprehension
,
excepting
on
one
point
.
And
now
I
come
to
the
principal
,
the
only
important
part
of
my
conduct
,
while
belonging
to
you
,
which
excites
my
own
anxiety
,
or
requires
very
solicitous
explanation
.
With
the
greatest
res
t
,
and
the
warmest
friendship
,
do
I
men
—
tion
Miss
oodhouse
;
my
father
,
perhaps
,
will
think
I
ought
to
add
,
with
the
deepest
humiliation
.
A
few
words
which
dropped
from
him
yesterday
spoke
his
opinion
,
and
some
censure
I
acknowledge
myself
liable
to
.
My
behaviour
to
Miss
Woodhouse
indicated
,
I
believe
,
more
than
it
ought
.
In
order
to
assist
a
concealment
so
essential
to
me
,
I
was
led
on
to
make
more
than
an
allowableuse
of
the
son
of
intimacy
into
which
we
were
immediame
thrown
.
I
can
not
deny
that
Miss
Woodhouse
was
my
ostenaible
object
;
but
I
in
run
you
will
believe
the
declaration
,
that
had
I
not
been
convinced
of
her
indifference
,
I
would
not
have
been
induced
by
any
selfish
view
to
go
on
.
Amiable
and
delightful
an
Miss
Woodhouae
is
,
she
never
gave
me
the
idea
of
a
young
woman
likely
to
be
attached
;
and
that
she
was
perfectly
ﬂee
from
any
tendency
to
being
attached
to
me
,
was
as
much
mum
.
209
my
conviction
as
my
wish
.
She
received
my
attentions
with
an
easy
,
friendly
,
good-humoan
playfulness
which
exactly
suited
me
.
We
seemed
to
understand
each
other
.
From
our
relative
simadon
,
tboee
attentions
were
her
due
,
and
were
felt
to
be
so
.
Whether
Mia
Woodhouse
began
really
to
understand
me
before
the
expiration
of
that
fortnight
I
can
not
say
;
when
I
called
to
take
leave
of
her
,
I
remember
that
I
was
within
a
moment
of
confessing
the
tmth
,
and
I
then
fancied
she
was
not
without
suspicion
;
but
I
have
no
doubt
of
her
having
since
detected
me
—
at
least
in
some
degree
.
She
may
not
have
surmised
the
whole
,
but
her
quickness
must
have
penetrated
a
part
.
I
can
not
doubt
it
.
You
will
ﬁnd
,
whenever
the
subject
becomes
freed
from
its
present
restraints
,
that
it
did
not
take
her
wholly
by
surprise
.
She
frequently
gave
me
hints
of
it
.
I
remember
her
telling
me
at
the
ball
that
I
owed
Mrs
Elton
gratitude
for
her
attentions
to
Miss
Fairfax
.
I
hope
this
history
of
my
conduct
towards
her
will
be
admitted
by
you
and
my
father
as
great
extenuation
of
what
you
saw
amiss
.
While
you
considered
the
as
having
sinned
against
Emma
Woodhouse
,
I
could
deserve
nothing
from
either
.
Acquit
me
here
,
and
procure
for
me
,
when
it
is
allowable
,
the
acquinal
and
good
wishes
of
that
said
Emma
Woodhouse
,
whom
I
regard
with
so
much
brotherly
affection
as
to
long
to
have
beras
deeply
and
as
happily
in
love
as
myself
.
Whatever
strange
things
I
said
or
did
during
that
fortnight
you
have
now
a
key
to
.
My
heart
was
in
Highbury
,
and
my
business
was
to
get
my
body
thitheras
often
as
might
be
,
and
with
the
least
suspicion
.
If
you
remember
any
queernesses
set
them
all
to
the
right
account
.
Of
the
pianoforte
so
much
talked
of
,
I
feel
it
only
neeesnry
to
say
,
that
its
being
ordered
was
absolutely
unknown
to
Miss
F
—
,
who
would
never
have
allowed
me
to

Since

,

will
be

than
I
foresaw
,
I
have
heard
from
her
.
She

of
her

;
but
an

Let
me
hear
from
you
without

;
I
am
impatient
for
a

particular
;
Remember
how
few
minutes
I
was
at
Randalle
,
and
in
how
bewildered

how
mad

and
I

am

,
I
hope
,
rational
enough
to
make
the

of
my
letter
what
it
ought
to
be
.
It
is
,
in
fact
,
a
most
mortifying
retrospect
for
me
.
I

plea
of
concealing
the
truth
she
did
not
think
sufﬁcient
.
She
was
displased
:
I
thought
unreasonably
so
;
I
thought
her
,
on
a
thousand
occasions
,
unnecede
scrupulous
and
cautious
;
I
thought
her
even

.
But
the
was
always

.
If
I
had
followed
her
judgment
,
and
subdued
my
ritx
to
the
level
of
what
she
deemed
proper
,
I
Ihou
d
have
escaped
the
greatest
unhappiness
have
ever
known
.
We
quarrelled
.
Do
you
remember
the
morning
spent
at
Donwell
?
There
every
little
dissatisfaction
that
had
occurred
before
cane
to
a
crisis
.
I
was
late
:
I
met
her
walking
home
by
herself
,
and
wanted
to
walk
with
her
,
but
she
would
not
sulfer
it
.
She
absolutely
refused
to

me
,
which
I
then
thought
mm
unrusonable
.
Now
,
however
,
I
see
nothing
in
it
but
a
very
natural
and
consistent
degree
of
discretion
.
While
I
,
to
blind
the
world
to
our
engagement
,
was
behaving
one
hour
with
objectionable
particu
—
larity
to
another
woman
,
was
she
to
be
comer-rung
the
next
to
a
proposal
which
might
have
made
every
previous
caution
useless
?
Had
we
been
met
walking
together
between
Donwell
and
Highbury
,
the
truth
must
have
been
tedI
was
mad
enough
,
however
,
to
resent
.
I
oubted
her
affection
.
I
doubted
it
more
the
next
day
on
Box
Hill
;
when
,
provoked
by
such
conduct
on
my
ride
,
such
shameful
,
into
ent
,
neglect
of
her
,
and
such
apparent
devotion
to
Miss
W.
,
as

would
have
been
impossible
for
any
woman
of
sense
to
endure
,
she
ke
her
resentment
in
a
Ion-n
of
words
perfectly
inte
ligible
to
me
.
In
short
,
my
dear
madam
,
it
was
a
quarrel
blameleu
on
her
side
,
abominable
on
mine
;
and
I
returned
the
tarneeveoing
to
Richmond
,
though
I
might
have
said
with
you
till
the
next
moming
,
merely
because
I
would
be
as
angry
with
her
as
possible
.
Even
then
,
I
was
not
such
I
fool
as
not
to
mean
tobereconciled
in
time
;
but
I
was
the
injured
person
—
injured
by
her
coldness
—
and
I
went
away
determined
that
she
thould
make
the
ﬁru
advances
.
I
shall
alwa
I
congratulate
myself
that
you
were
not
of
the
Box
linll
party
.
Had
you
witnetsed
my
behaviour
there
,
I
can
hardly
suppose
you
would
ever
have
thought
well
of
me
again
.
Its
effect
upon
her
appears
in
the
immediate
resolution
it
produced
.
As
soon
as
she
found
I
was
really
gone
from
Randalls
,
the
closed
with
the
offer
of
that
olhciout
Mr
:
Elton
;
the
whole
system
of
whose
treatment
of
her
,
by
the
bye
,
has
ever
ﬁlled
me
with
indignation
and
hatred
.
I
must
not
quan-ei
with
a
spirit
of
forbearance
which
ha
been
so
richly
extended
towards
myself
;
but
,
otherwise
,
I
drould
loudly
protest
against
the
share
of
it
which
that
woman
has
known
.
‘Jane
,
’
indeed
!
You
will
observe
that
l
have
not
yet
indulged
myself
in
calling
her
by
that
name
,
even
to
you
.
Think
,
then
,
what
I
must
have
endured
in
hearing
it
bandied
between
the
Eltons
,
with
all
the
vulgarity
of
needlesl
repetition
,
and
all
the
innolenoe
of
imaginary
superiority
.
Have
patience
with
me
,
I
shall
soon
have
done
.
She
closed
with
this
offer
,
resolving
to
break
with
me
entirely
,
and
wrote
the
next
day
to
tell
me
that
we
never
were
to
meet
again

This
letter
reached
me
on
the
very
morning
of
my
poor
aunt’l
death
.
I
answered
it
within
an
hour
;
but
from
the
confusion
of
mun
.
213
my
mind
,
and
the
multiplicity
of
business
falling
on
me
at
once
,
my
answer
,
instead
of
being
sent
with
all
the
many
other
letters
of
that
day
,
was
locked
up
in
my
wridng-desk
,
and
I
,
trusting
that
I
had
written
enough
,
though
but
a
few
lines
,
to
satisfy
her
,
remained
without
any
uneasiness
.
I
was
lather
di
pointed
that
I
did
not
hear
from
heragain
speedily
;
it
I
made
excuses
for
her
,
and
was
too
busy
,
and

may
I
add
?

We
removed
to
Windsor
;
and
two
days
afterwards
I
received
a
parcel
from
her
—
my
own
letters
all
retumedl
—
and
a
few
lines
at
the
same
time
by
the
post
,
stating
her
extreme
rise
at
not
having
had
the
smallest
reply
to
her

;

I

the

,
I
knew
all
about
it
,
and
instantly
saw
what
she
had
been
doing
.
It
was
perfectly
accordant
with
that
resolution
of
character
which
I
knew
her
to
possess
;
andthc
secrecy
she
had
maintained
asto
any
such
design
in
her
former
letter
,
was
equally
descriptive
of
its
anxious
delicacy
.
For
the
world
would
not

have
seemed
to
threaten
me
.

the
shock
;
imagine
how

I
had

my

blunder

at

I
must

Without
his
sanction
I
could
not
hope
to
he

to
again
.
I
spoke
;
circumstances
were
in
my
favour
;
the
late
event
had
softened
away
his
pride
,
and
he
was

HIS
letter
must
make
its
way
to
Emma’feelings
.
She
was
obliged
,
in
spite
of
her
previous
deterrniuation
lo
the
contrary
,
to
do
it
all
the
juntice
that
Mrs
Weston
foretold
.
As
soon
as
she
came
to
her
earns

own
name
,
it
was
irresistible
;
every
line
relating
to
herself
was
interesting
.
and
almost
every
line
agreeable
;
and
when
this
charm
ceased
,
the
subject
could
still
maintain
itself
by
the
natural
retnrn
of
her
former
regard
for
the
writer
,
and
the
very
strong
attraction
which
any
picture
of
love
most
have
for
her
at
that
moment
.
She
never
stopt
till
she
had
gone
through
the
whole
:
and
though
i
:
wasimpossible
not
to
feel
that
he
had
been
wrong
,
yet
he
had
been
less
wrong
than
she
had
lup;
and
he
had
suffered
and
wasverysorry
;
and
e
was
so
grateful
to
Mrs
Weston
,
and
so
much
in
love
with
Miss
Fairfax
,
and
she
was
so
happy
herself
,
that
there
was
no
being
severe
5
and
could
he
have
entered
the
room
,
she
must
have
shaken
hands
with
him
as
hartin
as
ever
.
She
thought
so
well
of
the
letter
,
that
when
Mr
Knightley
came
a
in
she
desired
him
to
read
it
.
She
was
sure
of
Mrs
man’s
wishing
it
to
he
communicated
;
especially
to
one
who
,
like
Mr
Knighdey
,
had
seen
so
much
to
blame
in
his
conduct
.
“
I
shall
he
very
glad
to
look
itover
,
”
said
he
;
“but
it
seems
long
.
I
will
take
it
home
with
me
at
night
.
'
But
that
would
not
do
.
Mr
Weston
was
to
call
in
the
evening
,
and
she
must
return
it
by
him
.
“
I
would
rather
be
talking
to
you
,
”
he
replied
;
“but
as
it
seems
a
matter
of
justice
,
it
shall
he
done.”
He
began
—
stopping
,
however
,
almost
directly
to
say
,
“
Had
I
been
offered
the
sight
of

of
this
gentleman's

,
Emma
,
it
would
not
have
been
taken
with
such
indi
erence
.
'
He
proceeded
a
little
farther
,
reading
to
himself
;
and
then
,
with
a
smile
,
observed
,
“Humph

“

will
be
natural
for
me

Ihortly
afterwards
,

Mr

to
his

with
greater
alacrit

he
,

—
he

,
however
,
to
his

.
Mr
Weston‘s
sanguine
temper
was
a
blessing
on
all
l1ll
upright
and
honourable
exertions
;
but
Mr
Weston
earned
every
present
comfort
before
he
endeavoured
to
gain
it
.
Very
true
;
he
did
not
come
till
Mist
Fairfax
was
here.”
“
And
I
have
not
forgotten
,
”
said
Emma
,
“
how
sure
cm
were
that
he
might
have
come
sooner
if
he
would

on
pass
it
over
very
handsomely
;
but
you
were
perfectly
right.”
"

was

in

Emma
;
but
yet
,
I
think
,
had
you
not
been
in
the
use
,
I
should
nill
have
distrusted
him.”
When
he
came
to
Miss
Woodhouse
,
he
was
obliged
to
read
the
whole
of
it
aloud
—
all
that
related

at

concluding
,
however
,
seriously
,
and
,
after
steady
reﬂection
,
thus

Emma
agreed
to
it
,
and
with
a
blush
of
sensibility
on
Harriet’s
account
,
which
she
could
not
give
any
sincere
explanation
of
.
“
You
had
better
go
on
,
”
said
she
.
He
did
so
,
but
very
soon
stopt
again
to
say
,
“
The
pianoforbe
!
Ah
!
—
that
was
the
act
of
a
very
,
very
young
man
,
one
too
young
to
consider
whether
the
inconvenience
of
it
might
not
very
much
exceed
the
pleasure
.

boyish
scheme
,
indeed
!
I
can
not
comhend
a
man

wishing
to
give
a
woman
any
proof
of
affection
which
he
knows
she
would
rather
dispense
with
:
and
he
did
know
that
the
would
have
prevented
the
instrument’s
coming
if
she
could.”
After
this
,
he
made
some
progress
without
any
pause
.
Frank
Churchill’s
confession
of
having
behaved
shamefully
was
the
ﬁrst
thing
to
call
for
more
than
a
word

?
.
.
.
“

was
then
his
remark
.
“
You
did
behave
very
shamefully

You
never
wrote
a
truer
line

'
And
having
gone
through
what
immediately
followed
of
the
basis
of
their
disagreement
,
and
his
persisting
to
act
in
direct
tion
to
Jane
Fairfax
s
sense
of
right
,
he
made
2
er
pause
to
say
,
“This

,
and
in
no

,
there
would
be
much
very
much
,
to
be

with
.
She
promised
to
think
of
it
,
and
advined
him
to
think
of
it
more
;
but
he
was
fully
convinced
that
no
reﬂection
could
alter
his
wilhee
or
his
opinion
on
the
mhjeet
.
He
had
given
it
,
he
could
assure
her
,
very
long
and
calm
consideration
;
he
had
been
walking
nwayfrorn
William
Larkins
the
whole
morning
to
have
hll
thought
:
to
himself
.
“
Ah

Emma
.
“
I
am

William

:

You
mutt

She
promived
,

,
to

;
and
pretty

.
:21
nearly
promised
,
moreover
,
to
think
of
it
with
the
intention
of
ﬁnding

good
scheme
.
It
is
remarkable
that
Emma
,
in
the
many
,
very
many
,
points
of
view
in
which
she
was
now
beginning
to
consider
Danwell
Abbey
,
was
never
struck
with
any
sense
of
injury
to
her
nephew
Henry
,
whose
rights
as
heir-expectant
had
formerly
been
sounaciouely
regarded
.
Think
she
must
of
the
possible
difference
to
the
poor
little
boy
;
and
yet
the
only
gave
herself
a
nucy
conIcious
Imile
about
it
,
and
found
amusement
in
detecting
the
real
cause
of
that
violent
dislike
of
Mr
Knightley’s
marrying
Jane
Fairfax
,
or
anybody
else
,
which
at
the
time
she
had
wholly
imputed
to
the
amiable
colicitude
of
the
inter
and
the
aunt
.
This
p
of

,
this
plan
of
marrying
and
continuing

the
more
she
contemplated
it
the
more
pleasing
it
became
.
Hie

seemed
to
leuen

,

Such
a
companion
for

in
the
perioda
of
anxiety
and
cheeriecsness
before
her
!
Such
a
partner
in
all
those
duties
and
cares
to
which
time
must
be
giving
increase
of
melancholy
!
She
would
have
been
too
happy
but
for
poor
Harriet
;
but
every
hleuing
of
her
own
ueerned
to
involve
and
advance
the
eulferinge
of
her
friend
,
who
must
now
be
even
excluded
from
Hartlield

Emma

loner
in

way
.
Emma
could
not
deplore
her
future
abunce
as
any
deduction
from
her
own
enjoyment
.
In
such
a
party
,
Harriet
would
be
rather
a
dead
weight
than
otherwise
;
but
for
the
poor
girl
herself
,
it
seemed
a
peculiarly
cruel
necessity
that
was
to
be
placing
her
in
such
a
state
of
unmerited
punishment

Twasaverygreat
reliefto
Emma
to
ﬁnd
Harriet
as
desirous
as
herself
to
avoida
meeting
.
Their
intercourse
was
inful

How

herself
very
much
,
as
might
be
supposed
,
without
reproaches
,
or
apparent
use
of
illusage
;
and
yet
Emma
fancied
therewasasmnethingof
resentment
,
a
something
bordering
on
it
in
her
style
,
which
incmsed
the
desirableness
of
their
being
separate
.
It
might
be
only
her
own
comcionmeao
;
but
it
leemed
as
if
an
angel
only
could
have
been
quite
without
resentment
under
such
a
stroke
.
She
had
no
difficulty
in
procuring
Isabella’s
invitation
;
and
the
was
fortunate
in
having
a
mﬁicient
reason
for
asking
it
,
without
resorting
to
invention
.
There
was
a
tooth
amiss
.
Harriet
really
wished
,
and
had
wished
some
time
,
to
oonmlt
a
dentist
.
Mrs
John
Knig
was
delighted
to
he
of
use
;
anything
of

health
Win
a
recommendation
to
her
;
and
though
not
so
fond
of
a
dentist
as
of
a
Mr
Wingﬁeld
,
she
was
quite
eager
to
have
Harriet
under
her
care
.
When
it
was
thus
settled
on
her
sister’s
side
,
Emma
proposed
it
to
her
friend
,
and
found
her
very
pemadable
.
Harriet
was
to
go
;
min
.
:23
she
was
invited
for
at
least
a
fortnight
.
She
was
to
be
conveyed
in
Mr
Woodhouse’s
mrrisge
.
It
was
all
arranged
,
it
was
all
completed
,
and
Harriet
was
nfe
in
Bum-wick
Square
.
Now
Emma
could
,
indeed
,
enjoy
Mr
Knightley’s
visits
;
now
she
could
talk
,
and
she
could
listen
with
true
happiness
,
unchecked
by
that
sense
of
injustice
,
of
guilt
,
of
something
most
painfid
,
which
had
haunted
her
when
remembering
how
disappointed
a
heart
was
near
her
,
how
much
might
at
that
moment
,
and
at
a
little
distance
,
be
enduring
by
the
feelings
which
she
had
led
astra
heroelf
.
he
difference
of
Harriet
at
Mrs
Goddard
s
,
or
in
London
made
,
perhaps
,
an
unreasonable
difE-rence
in
Emma’s
sensations
;
but
she
could
not
think
of
her
in
London
without
objects
of
curiosity
and
employment
,
which
must
be
averﬁng
the
past
,
and
carrying
her
out
of
herself
.
She
would
not
allow
any
other
anxiety
to
succeed
directly
to
the
place
in
her
mind
which
Harriet
had
occupied
.
There
was
a
communication
before
her
,
one
which
the
only
could
be
com
nt
to
make
—
the
confession
of
her
engagement
to
er
father
;
but
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
at
preterit
She
had
resolved
to
defer
the
disclosure
till
Mrs
Weston
were
safe
and
well
.
No
additional
agitation
should
be
thrown
at
this
period
among
those
she
loved
—
and
the
evil
should
not
act
on
herself
by
anticipation
before
the
appointed
time
.
A
fortnight
,
at
last
,
of
leisure
and
peace
of
mind
,
to
crown
every
warmer
,
but
more
agitating
,
delight
,
should
be
hers
.
She
soon
resolved
,
equally
as
a
duty
and
a
pleasure
,
to
employ
half
an
hour
of
this
holiday
of
spirits
in
calling
on
Miss
Fairfax
.
She
ought
to
go
—
and
the
was
longing
to
see
her
;
the
resemblance
of
their
present
situations
increasing
every
other
motive
of
good-will
.
224
ms
.
It
would
be
a
rural
satisfaction
;
but
the
connciounneu
of
a
similarity
of
prospect
would
certainly
add
to
the
interest
with
which
she
should
attend
to
anything
Jane
might
communimte
.
She
went
—
she
had
driven
once
nnmcceatfully
m
the
door
,
but
had
not
been
into
the
house
since
the
morning
after
Box
Hill
,
when
poor
Jane
had
been
in
such
diatress
as
had
ﬁlled
her
with
companion
,
though
all
the
worst
of
her
miferinge
had
been
unsuqiected
.
The
fear
of
being
still
unwelcome
determined
her
,
though
assured
of
their
being
at
home
,
to
wait
in
the
passage
,
and
send
up
her
name
.
She
heard
Patty
announcing
it
;
but
no
tuch
bustle
succeeded
as
poor
Min
Bates
had
before
made
so
happily
intelligible
.
No
;
the
heard
nothing
but
the
instant
reply
of
.
“Beg
her
to
walk
up
;
”
and
a
moment
afterwards
she
was
meton
the
mire
by
Jane
herself
coming
eager
!
forward
as
if
no
other
reception
of
her
were
felt
in
cient
.
Emma
had
never
seen
her
look
so
well
,
so
lovely
,
so
engaging
.
There
was
consciousness
,
animation
,
and
warmth
;
there
was
everything
which
her
countenance
or
manner
could
ever
have
wanted
.
She
came
forward
with
an
oﬂ‘ercd
hand
;
and
said
,
in
a
low
,
but
very
feeling
tone—
“This
in
most
kind
,
indeed
!
Miss
Woodhouse
,

ble
for
me
to
ex
rem
—
I
ho

me

Emma
was
gratiﬁed
,
and
would
soon
have
shewn
no
want
of
words
,
if
the
sound
of
Mrs
Elton’s
voice
from
the
sitting-room
had
not
checked
her
,
and
made
it
expedient
to
compress
all
her
friendly
and
all
her
congratulatory
sensations
into
a
very
,
very
earnest
shake
of
die
hand
.
Mrs
Bates
and
Mrs
Elton
were
together
.
Miss
Bates
was
out
,
which
accounted
for
the
previous
tranquillity
.
Emma

was

and
as

met
her
with
unusual
graciouuneoe
,
she
hoped
the
rencontre
would
do
them
no

She
soon

herself

RS
WESTON’S
friends
were
all
made
happy
by
her
safety
;
and
if
the
satisfaction
of
her
well-doing
could
be
increased
to
Emma
,
it
was
by
knowing
her
to
be
the
mother
of
a
little
girl
.
She
had
been
decided
in
wishing
for
a
Miss
Weston
.
She
would
not
acknowledge
that
it
was
with
any
view
of
making
a
match
for
her
,
hex-after
,
with
either
of
InbelIa’s
sons
;
but
she
was
convinced
that
a
daughter
would
suit
both
father
and
mother
best
.
It
would
he
a
great
comfort
to
Mr
Weston
,
as
he
grew
older
—
and
even
Mr
Wesson
might
be
growing
older
ten
years
hence
—
to
have
his
ﬁreside
enlivened
by
the
sports
and
the
nonsense
,
the
freaks
and
the
fancies
of
a
child
never
banished
from
home
;
and
Mrs
Weston
—
ho
one
could
doubt
that
a
daughter
would
he
most
to
her
;
and
it
would
be
quite
a
pity
that
any
one
who
so
well
knew
how
to
teach
,
should
not
have
their
powers
in
exercise
again
.
"
She
has
had
the
advantage
,
you
know
,
of
ractising
on
me

her

Adelaide

'
“
That
is
,
”
replied
Mr
Knightley
,
"
she
will
indulge
her
even
more
than
she
did
you

that
she

“Poor

cried
Emma
;

what

“Nothing

replied
:
“
But
I

the

your

to

the

I

My

It
was
very

you
to

,
‘Whatrighthashe

and
I
am

very
natural
for
you
to
feel
that
it

manner

I

“How

“

of

about

I

of

she
added
presently
,
laughing

blushing
,
“I

Emma
grieved
that
she
could
not
he
more
openly
just
to
one
important
service
which
his
hmer
sense
would
have
rendered
her
,
to
the
advice
which
would
have
saved
her
from
the
worst
of
all
her
womanly
follies
—
41H
wilful
intimacy
with
Harriet
Smith
;
but
it
was
too
tender
a
subject
.
She
could
not
enter
on
it
.
Harriet
was
very
seldom
mentioned
between
them
.
This
,
on
his
side
,
might
merely
proceed
from
her
not
being
thought
of
;
hut
Emma
was
rather
inclined
to
attribute
it
to
delicacy
,
and
a
suspicion
,
from
some
appearances
,
that
their
friendship
were
declining
.
She
was
aware
herself
that
,
parting
under
any
other
circumstances
,
they
certainly
should
have
corresponded
more
,
and
that
her
intelligence
would
not
have
rested
,
as
it
now
almost
wholly
did
,
on
Isabella’s
letters
.
He
might
observe
that
it
was
so
.
The
pain
of
ha'ng
obliged
to
‘
concealment
towards
him
was
very
little
inrior
to
the
pain
of
having
made
Harriet
unhappy
.
Isabella
lent
quite
as
good
no
account
of
her
visitor
as
could
he
expected
;
on
her
ﬁrst
arrival
she
had
thought
her
out
of
spirits
,
which
appeared
perfectly

tince
that

had
been

,
Ibe
did
not
appear
to
ﬁnd
Harriet
different
from
what
the
had
known
her
before
.
Isabella
,
to
be
sure
,
was
no
very
quick
observer
;
yet
if
Harriet
had
not
been
equal
to
playing
with
the
children
,
it
would
not
have
eecaped
her
.
Emma’a
comforts

“Yes

yes

I
am
amused
that

What

I
am
not

conversation
that

it

by

of

and
Mn

was

on

to
consider

light

,
as

good
one

—
well
aware
of
the
near

equal
importance
of
the
two
recommendations
to

mind

him
that
it
would
be
for

,
and
having

feelings
himself
which
almost
admitted
it
,
he
began
to
think
that
some
time
or
other
,
in
another
year
or
two
,
perhaps
,
it
might
not
be
so
very
bad

She
had
such
a
regard
for
Mr
Knighrley
,
an
to

even

;
and
it

in

and

in

respect

,

And
who
but
Mr
Knightley
could
know
and
bear
with
Mr
Woodhouaeno
at
to
make
Inch
an

desirable
!
The
diﬁiculty
of

of
poor
Mr
Woodhouae
had
been
alwayl
felt
in
her
husband’r
planar
and
her
own
,
for
a
marriage
between
Frank
and
Emma
.
How
to

the
claiml
of
Enlcombe
and
Hartlield
had
been
a
continual
impediment
—

acknowledged
by
Mr
Weston

by

he
had
never

better
than
by

“Those

But
here
there
was
nothing
to
be
shifted
of
in
a
wild
Ipecularion
on
the
future
.
It
was
all
right
,
all
open
,
all
equal
.
No
ncriﬁce
on
any
ride
worth
the
name
.
It
war
a
union
of
the
highs
:
promile
of
felicity
in
itself
,
and
without
one
real
,
rational
difﬁculty
to
oppose
or
delay
it
.

If
anything
could
increase

was
perceiving
that
the

would
soon
have
outgrown

;
but
ﬁve
minutes
were
enough
to
familiarize
the
idea
to
his
quickness
of
mind
.
He
saw
the
ndvauuges
of
the
match
,
and
rejoiced
in
them
with
all
the
constancy
of
his
wife
;
but
the
wonder
of
it
was
very
soon
nothing
;
and
by
the
end
ofan
hour
he
was
not
far
from
believing
that
he
had
always
foreseen
it
.
“
It

he

tell
her
;
and
Miss
Bates

,
it
passed
,
of

,
to
Mrs
Cole
,
Mrs
Perry
,
and
Mrs
Elton
,
im

afterwards

It
was
no
more
than
the
principals
were
prepared
for
;
th
had
calculated
from
the
time
of
its
being
known
at
andalls
how
soon
it
would
be
over

;
and
were
thinking
of
themselves
,
as
the
evening
wonder
in
many
a
family
circle
,
with
great
sagacity
.
In
general
,
it
was
a
very
well-approved
match
.
Some
might
think
him
,
and
others
might
think
her
,
the

in
luck
.
One
set
might
recommend
their
all
removing
to
Donwell
,
and
leaving
Hartlield
for
the
John
Knightleys
;
and
another
might
predict
dimgreemenu
among
their
servants
;
but
yet
,
upon
the
whole
,
there
was
no
serious
objection
railed
,
except
in
one
habiution
—
the
Vicarage
.
There
,
the
surprize
was
not
softened
by
any
satisfaction
.
Mr
Elton
cared
little
about
it
,
compared
with
his
wife
;

exh'emely
glad
to
see
him
;
but
there
was
a
degree
of
conﬁuion
,
a
numberof
embarrassing
recollectione
,
on
each
die
.
They
met
and
mailing
,
but
with
a
consciousness
which
at
lint
allowed
little
to
be
laid
;
and
having
all
sat
down
again
,
there
was
for
some
time
such
a
blank
in
the
circle
that
Emma
began
to
doubt
whether
the

the
had
long
felt
,
of

Frank
Churchiﬁ
once

and
of

,
would
yield
its
proportion

When
Mr

joined
the
party
,
however
,
and
when
the

,
there
was
no
longer
a
want
of

,
or
of
courage
and
opportunity
for
Frank

to
draw

with

after

spoke

he
cried

Emma
was
deligh
,
and
only
wanted
him
to
go
on
in
the

style
;
but
his
mind
was
the
next
moment
in
his
own
concerns
and
with
his
own
Jane
,
and
his
next
words
were
—
“Did

yet
without

at

her

Ieemed
to

Before

,
Emma
attended
Harriet
to

saw
her

bemowed
on

The

The

month
was
the
one
ﬁxed
on
,
as
far
as
they
dared
,
by
Emma
and
Mr
Knightley
.
They
had
determined
that
their
marriage
ought
to
be
concluded
,
while
John

Isabella
were

at
