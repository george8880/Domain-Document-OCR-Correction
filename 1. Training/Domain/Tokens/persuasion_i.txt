IR
WALTER
ELLIOT
,
of
Kellynch
Hall
,
S
in
Somcraeuhirc
,
was
a
man
who
,
for
his
own
amusement
,
never
took
up
any
book
but
the
Baronetage
;
there
he
found
occupation
for
an
idle
hour
and
consolation
in
a
distrened
one
;
there
his
faculties
were
roused
into
admiration
and
respect
,
by
contemplating
the
limited
remnant
of
the
earliest
patents
;
there
any
unwelcome
sensations
,
arising
from
domestic
affairs
,
changed
naturally
into
pity
and
contempt
.
As
he
turned
over
the
almost
endless
creations
of
the
last
century
,
and
there
,
if
every
other
leaf
were
powerless
,
he
could
read
his
own
history
with
an
interest
which
never
failed
:
this
was
the

the
favourite
volume

of

In
an
thin
deserved
b
his
ownf'ylflaldeynElliot
had
been
an
yexcellent
woman
,
ysensible
and
amiable
,
whose
judgment
and
conduct
,
if
they
might
be
pardoned
the
youthful
infatuation
which
made
her
Lady
Elliot
,
had
never
required
indulgence
afterwards
.
She
had
hnrnoured
,
or
softened
,
or
concealed
his
failings
,
and
promoted
his
real
rcspccuibility
for
seventeen
years
;
and
though
not
the
very
happiest
being
in
the
world
herself
,
had
found
enough
in
her
duties
,
her
friends
,
and
her
children
,
to
attach
her
to
life
,
and
make
it
no
matter
of
indifference
to
her
when
she
was
called
on
to
quit
them
.
Three
girls
,
the
two
eldest
sixteen
and
fourteen
,
was
an
awful
legacy
for
a
mother
to
bequeath
,
an
awful
charge
rather
,
to
conﬁde
to
the
authority
and
guidance
of
a
conceited
,
silly
father
.
She
had
,
however
,
one
very
intimate
friend
,
a
sensible
,
deserving
woman
,
who
had
been
brought
,
by
mng
attachment
to
herself
,
to
settle
close
by
her
,
in
the
village
of
Kellynch
;
and
on
her
kindness
and
advice
Lady
Elliot
mainly
relied
for
the
best
help
and
maintainnnce
of
the
good
principles
and
instmction
which
she
had
been
anxiously
giving
her
daughters
.
This
friend
and
Sir
Walter
did
not
marry
,
whatever
might
have
been
anticipated
on
that
head
by
their
acquaintance
.
Thirteen
years
had
passed
away
since
Lady
Elliot’s
death
,
and
they
were
still
near
neighbours
and
minute
friends
,
and
one
remained
a
widower
,
the
other
a
widow
.
That
Lady
Russell
,
of
steady
age
and
character
,
and
extremely
well
provided
for
,
should
have
no
thought
of
a
second
marriage
,
needs
no
apology
to
the
public
,
which
is
rather
apt
to
be
unreasonably
diuonmted
when
a
woman
doe
:
marry
again
,
than
when
she
does
not
,
but
Sir
Walter’s
continuing
in
singlenesa
requires
explanation
.

“
I
pmme
to
observe
,
Sir

,
that
,
in
the
way
of

,
gentlemen
of

are
well
to

with
.
I
have
had
a

I

confeaa
that

,
and
are
an
likely
to
make

:
nu
any

of

Therefore

what
I

,
therefore
,
thus
much
I
venture
upon
,
that
it
will
not
greatly
surprise
me
if
,
with
all
our
caution
,
some
mmour
of
the
truth
should
get
abroad
;
in
the
w

of

,
as
I
was
going

since
app

unquestionably
follow
,
I
should
think
any

worth

beg

to
add

that

Sir

on

nodded

But
soon
afterwards
,
rising
and
pacin
the
room
,
he
observed
musically—
“There

I
imagine
,
who
would
not
be
surprised

“
They
would
look
around
them
,
no
doubt
,
and
bless
their
good
fortune
,
”
said
Mn
Clay
,
for
Mrs
Clay
was
present
:
her
father
had
driven
her
over
,
nothing
being
of
so
much
use
to
Mrs
Clay’s
health
as
a
drive
to
Kellynch
:
“but
I
quite
agree
with
my
father
in
thinking
s
tailor
might
be
a
very
detirahle
tenant
.
I
have
known
a

coolly
,
“

Lady

was
extremely
sorry
that
such
a
measure
should
have
been
resorted
to
at
all
,
wondered
,
grieved
,
and
feured

the
aﬂ'ront
it

in

Clay
s
being
of
so
much
use
,
while
Anne
could
be
of
none
,
was
I
very
sore
aggravation
.
Anne
herself
was
become
hardened
to
such
nﬂ'ronu
,
but
she
felt
the
impnrdence
of
the
arrangement
uite
st
keenly
u
Lady

.
With
a
great
dnl
is
quiet
observation
,
and
a
knowledge
,
which
she
often
wished
less
,
of
her
father
s
character
,
the
was
sensible
that
results
the
most
serious
to
his
fumin
from
the
intimacy
were
more
than
possible
.
She
did
not
imagine
that
her
father
had
at
present
an
idea
of
the
kind
.
Mrs
Clay
had
freckles
,
and
a
projecting
tooth
,
and
s
clumsy
wrist
,
which
he
was
continuelly
making
severe
remrks

,
inﬁnitely
more
dangerous
attractions
than
any
merelypersnnal
might
have
been
.
Anne
was
so
impressed
by
the
degree
of
their
danger
,
that
she
could
not
excuse
herself
from
trying
to
make
it
perc
tible
to
her
sister
.
she

in
the

a

would
be

much
more

than
herself
,
should
never
,
she
thought
,
have
reason
to
reproach
her
for
giving
no
warning
.
.
She
spoke
,
and
seemed
only
to
oﬂ'end
.
Elizabeth
could
not
conceive
how
such
an
absurd
suspicion
should
occur
to
her
,
and
indignantly
answered
for

it

not
that

themselves
,
and

walked

the

time
in
a
sort
of
desolate
tranquillity
to
the
Lodge
,
where
Ihe
was
to
spend
the
tint

.
Her
friend
was
not
in
better
lPll'lll
than
hereelf
.
Lady
Ruuell
felt
this
brak-up
of
the
family
exceedingly
.
Their
respecmbility
was
as
dear
to
her
as
her
own
,
and
a
daily
intercourse
had
become
recious
by
habit
.
It
was
painful
to
look
upon
their
deserted
grounds
,
and
still
worse
to
anticipate
the
new
hsnds
they
were
to
fall
into
;
and
to
escape
the
solitariness
and
the
melancholy
of
to

village
,
and
be
out
of
the
way
when
Admiral
Ind
Mrs
Croft
lim
arrived
,
she
had
determined
to
make
her
own
nbuence
from
home
begin
when
she
must
give
up
Anne
.
Accordingl
their
removal
was
made
together
,
and
Anne
was
set
own
at
Uppercross
Cottage
,
in
the
lint
stage
of
Lady
Russell’s
va.
.
Uppercrou
was
a
moderate-sized
village
,
which
a
few
years
back
had
been
completely
in
the
old
English
style
,
containing
only
two
houses
Iuperinr
in
apparance
to
those
of
the
yoemen
and
labourers
;
the
mansion
of
the
squire
,
with
its
high
walls
,
great
gates
,
and
old
trees
,
substantial
and
nnmodernized
,
and
the
compact
,
tight
panonage
,
enclosed
in
its
own
neat
garden
,
with
a
vme
and
a
par-tree
trained
round
it

;
but
upon
the
marriage
of
the
young
’squire
,
it
had
received
the
improvement
of
u
farm-house
,
eleveted
into
I
cottage
,
for
his
residence
,
and
Uppercrous
Cottage
,
with
its
viranda
,
French
windows
,
and
other
prettinessel
,
was
quite
as
likely
to
catch
the
traveller’s

as
the
more
consistent
and
considerable
aspect
and

of
the
Great
House
,
about
a
quarter
of

Here
Anne
had
often
been

She
knew
the
ways
of
Uppercross
as
well
as
thoee
of

Anne
had
always
thought
such
a

highly
im

she
had
ceased
to
endeavour
to
check
it

rom
believing
that
,
though
there
were
on
each
side
continual
subjects
of
offence
,
neither
family
could
now
do
without
it

To
the
Gmt

accordingly
they
went
,
to
sit
the
fiill
half
hour
in
the
old-fuhioned
square
parlour
,
with
a
small
urpet
and
ohining
floor
,
to
which
the
present
daughten
of
the
house
were
grudually
giving
the
proper
sir
of
conﬁuion
by
a
grand
piano-forte
and
a

ﬂower-stands
,
and
little

The

themselvel

to
be

in

The

in

She
had
this
communication
,
moreover
,
from
Mary
.
“
Mr

Musgrove
think
:
all
her
servant
:
to
Itady
,
that
it
would
be
high
union
to
call
it
in
queetion
;
but
I
am
sure
,
without
exaggeration
,
that
her
upper
house-maid
and
laundry-maid
,
instead
of
being
in
their
business
,
are
gadding
about
the
village
all
daylong
.
I
meet
them
wherever
I
go
;
and
I
declare
I
never
go
twice
into
my
uurlery
without
eeeing
something
of
them
.
If
Jemima
were
not
the

it
would

to

And
on

it
was
,
“

Again
.
it
won
Mary

that
Mn

How
was
Anne
to
let
all
these
matters
to

?
She
could
do
little
more
than

patiently
,
soften

altogether
an

;

her

the

of
her

been
almost
as

at

as

,
made
her
seem
to
have
lived
some
yearn
longer
in

her

.
Her

There
was
a
momentary
expre-ion
in
Ca
n
Wentworth
s
face
at
this
speech
,
a
certain
ce
of
his
bright
eye
,
and
curl
of
his
handsome
month
,
which
convinced
Anne
,
that
indeed
of
sharing
in
Mrs
Musgmve's
kind
wishes
,
as
to
her
non
,
he
had
probably
been
at
some
nltoget
rid
of
him
;
but
it
was
tootransient
an
in
ulgenoe
of
self-amusement
to
be
detected
by
any
who
undentood
him
less
than
herself
;
in
mother
moment
he
wu
perfectly
collected
and
serious
,
and
almoot
instantly
afterward
:
coming
up
to
the
tofu
,
on
which
she
and
Mrs
Mus
ve
were
sitting
.
took
a
place
by
the
latter
,
and
ente
into
convenatian
with
her
,
in
a
low
voice
,
about
her
Ion
,
doing
it
with
so
much
lympathy
and
natural
grace
,
st
ther
the
kindest
consideration
for
all
that
was
real
and
unahourd
in
the
parent’s
feelings
.
They
were
actually
on
the
same
sofa
,
for
Mrs
Musgrove
had
most
readily
made
room
for
him
:
they
were
divided
only
byMn
M
rove
.
It
was
no
inrigniﬁcant
barrier
,
indeed
.
Mn
mgmve
was
of
a
comfortable
substantial
size
,
inﬁnitely
more
ﬁtted
by
nature
to
express
good
cheer
and
good
humour
than
tenderness
and
sentiment
;
and
while
the
agitations
of
Anne’s
slender
form
,
and
pensive
face
,
may
be
considered
as
very
completely
screened
,
Captain
Wentworth
should
be
allowed
some
credit
for
the
self-command
with
which
he
attended
to
her
large
fat
sighingt
over
the
destiny
of
a
son
,
whom
alive
nobody
had
cared
for
.
Personal
size
and
mental
sorrow
have
certainly
no
necessary
proponinnr
.
A
large
bulky
ﬁgure
has
as
good
a
right
to
be
in
dee
afﬂiction
as
the
most
graceful
net
of
limbs
in
the
world
.
But
,
fair
or
not
fair
,
there
are
unbecoming
conjunctions
,
which
reason
will
patronize
in
vain
—
which
taste
can
not
tolerate
—
which
ridicule
will
seize

The

abused
him
for
hia
want
of
gallan

He
defended
himself
:
though
pmfeusing
that
he
w
d
never

ladiea
on

of

comprehend

“But

said
he
,
“

in
from
no

rather

to

from

Cousin

wan
as

quite
doubtful
,
as

as

Henrietta

It
united
Mary

to
think
Henrietta
the
one
preferred
on
the
very
account
of
Charla
:
Hayter
,
whoee
retenuiom
she
wrehed
to
see
put
an
end
to

She
ooked
down
very
decidedly
upon
the
Hnyterr
,
and
thought
it
would
be
quite
a
mirfortune
to
have
the
existing
connection
between
the
families
renewed
—
very
sad
for
herself
and
her

“You

“
I
can
not

him
at

a

for

;
and
considering
the
alliance
:
which
the
Murgrover
have
made
,
the
bar
no
right
to
throw
herself
away
.
I
do
not

woman
ha
!
a
right
to
make
a
choice
that
may
be
disagreeable
and
inconvenient
to

,
pmy
,
who
in

?
Nothing
but
a

curate
.
A
most
improper
match
for
Mira
Mungrove
of
Uppererou
.
'
Her
husband
,
however
,
would
not
agree
with
her
rmussrou

77
here
;
for
besides
having
a
regard
for
his
cousin
,
Charles
Hayter
was
an
eldest
son
,
and
he
saw
things
as
an
eldest
son
himself
.
“Now
you
are
talking
nonsense
,
Mary
,
”
was
therefore
his
answer
.
“
It
would
not
be
a
pen
:
match
for
Henrietta
,
but
Charles
has
a
very
fair
chance
,
through
the
Spicers
,
of
getting
something
from
the
Bishop
in
the
course
of
a
year
or
two
;
and
you
will
please
to
remember
,
that
he
is
the
eldest
son
;
whenever
my
uncle
dies
,
he
steps
into
very
pretty
property
.
The
estate
at
Winthro
Is
not
less
than
two
hundred
and
ﬁfty
acres
,
besides
e
farm
near
Tsunton
,
which
is
some
of
the
best
land
in
the
country
.
I
grant
you
,
that
an
of
them
but
Charles
would
be
a
very
shocking
match
or
Henrietta
,
and
indeed
it
could
not
be
;
he
is
the
only
one
that
could
be
possible
;
but
he
is
a
very
ood-nstured
,
good
sort
of
a
fellow
;
and
whenever
inthrop
comes
into
his
hands
,
he
will
make
a
diﬁ'erent
sort
of
lace
of
it
,
and
live
in
s
vc
diﬂ'erent
sort
of
way
;
an
with
that
property
he
wil
?
never
be
a
contemptibk
man
—
good
freehold
property
.
No
.
no
;
Henrietta
might
do
worse
than
many
Charles
Hayter
;
and
if
she
has
him
,
and
Louisa
can
get
Captain
Wentworth
,
I
shall
be
very
well
satisﬁed.”
“
Charles
may
say
what
he
pleases
,
'
cried
Mary
to
Anne
,
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
the
room
,
"
but
it
would
be
shockiu
so
have
Henrietta
marry
Charles
Hsyter
:
I
ve
be
thing
for
hr
,
and
still
worse
for
m
g
and
the
ore
it
is
very
much
to
he
wished
that
Captain
Wentworth
may
soon
put
him
quite
out
of
her
head
,
and
I
have
very
little
doubt
that
he
has
.
She
took
hardly
any
notice
of
Charles
Hayter
yesterday
.
I
wish
you
had
been
there
to
see
her
behaviour
.
And
as
to
Captain
Wentworth
s
liking
Louisa
as
well
as
Henrietta
,
it
is
nonsense
to
say
so
;
for
he
certainly
rim
like
Henrietta
a
great
deal
the
best
.
But
Charles
is
so
positive
!

I
wish
you
had
been
with
us
yesterda
,
for
then
you
might
have
decided
between
us
;
and

sure
you
would
have

I
did

unless

A
dinner
at
Mr
Mus
rove’s
had
been
the
occasion
when
all
these
things
shou
d
have
been
seen
by
Anne
;
but
she
had
staid
at
home
,
under
the
mixed
plea
of
a
headache
of
her
own
,
and
some
retum
of
indisposition
in
little
Charles
.
She
had
thought
only
of
avoiding
Captain
Wentworth
;
but
an
escape
from
being
aypealed
to
as
umpire
was
now
added
to
the
advantages
of
a
quiet
evening
.
As
to
Captain
Wentworth’s
views
,
she
deemed
it
of
more
consequence
that
he
should
know
his
own
mind
early
enough
not
to
be
endangering
the
happiness
of
either
sister
,
or
impeaching
his
own
honour
,
than
that
he
should
prefer
Henrietta
to
Louisa
,
or
Louisa
to
Henrietta
.
Either
of
them
would
,
in
all
Probability
,
make
him
an
affectionate
,
-humoured
wife
.
With
regard
to
Charles
Hayter
,
she
had
delicacy
which
must
be
pained
by
any
lightness
of
conduct
in
a
well-mning
young
woman
,
and
a
heart
to
|Pgilrathize
in
any
of
the
sufferings
it
occasioned
;
but
'
enrietta
found
herself
mistaken
in
the
nature
of
her
feelings
,
the
alteration
could
not
be
understood
too
soon
.
Charles
Hayter
had
met
with
much
to
disquiet
and
mortify
him
in
his
cousin’s
behaviour
.
She
had
too
old
I
regard
for
him
to
be
so
wholly
estranged
as
might
in
two
meetings
extinguish
every
past
hope
,
and
leave
him
nothing
to
do
but
to
keep
away
from
Uppercross
:
but
there
was
such
a
change
as
became
very
alarming
,
when
such
a
man
as
Captain
Wentworth
was
to
be
regarded
as
the
probable
cause
.
He
had
been
ailment
only
two
Sundays
,
and
when
they
parted
,
hid
left
her
interested
,
even
to
the
height
of
his
wishes
,
in
his
prospect
of
soon
quitting
his
present
curacy
,
and
obtaining
runsussron
.

that
of
Uppercmss
instead
.
It
had
then
seemed
the
object
nearest
her
hurt
,
that
Dr
Shirley
,
the
rector
,
who
for
more
than
fort
years
had
been
zealoiuly
discharging
all
the
duties
0
his
ofﬁce
,
but
was
now
rowing
too
Inﬁrm
for
many
of
them
,
should
be
quite
xed
an
engaging
a
curate
;
should
make
his
curacy
quite
as
good
as
he
could
afford
,
and
should
give
Charles
Hayter
the
promise
of
it
.
The
advantage
of
his
having
to
come
only
to
Uppercross
,
instead
of
going
six
miles
another
war
;
of
his
having
,
in
every
ct
,
a
better
curacy
;
0
his
belonging
to
their
dmr
Shirley
;
and
of
dear
,
good
Dr
Shirley
s
being
relieved
from
the
duty
which
he
could
no
longer
get
through
without
most
injurious
fatigue
,
had
been
a
great
deal
,
even
to
Louisa
,
but
had
been
almost
everything
to
Henrietta
.
When
he
came
back
,
alul
the
zeal
of
the
business
was
gone
Louisa
could
not
listen
at
all
to
his
account
of
a
conversation
which
he
had
held
with
Dr
Shirl
:
she
was
at
the
window
,
looking
out
for
Ca
tam
Wentworth
;
and
even
Henrietta
had
at
best
on
y
a
divided
attention
to
ive
,
and
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
the
former
don
t
and
solicitude
of
the
negociation
.
“Well
,
I
am
very
glad
,
indeed
;
but
I
always
thought
you
would
have
it
;
I
always
thought
you
sure
.
It
did
not
appear
to
me
that
—
in
short
,
you
know
,
Dr
Shirley

!
have
a
curate
,
and
you
had
secured
his
promise
.

,
Louisa
?
’
One
morning
,
very
soon
after
the
dinner
at
the
Musgroves
,
at
which
Anne
had
not
been
present
,
Captain
Weutworth
walked
into
the
drawing-room
It
the
Cottage
,
where
were
only
herself
and
the
little
invalid
Charles
,
who
was
lyin
on
the
sofa
.
The
surprise
of
ﬁnding
himself
almost
alone
with
Anne
Elliot
deprived
his
manners
of
their
usual
coinposule
:
he
started
,
and
could
only
say
,
“
I
thought
the
8°
masuasron
.
Miss
Mugroves
had
been
here
:
Mrs
Musgrove
told
me
I
should
ﬁnd
them
here
,
'
before
he
walked
to
the
window
to
recollect
himself
,
and
feel
how
he
ought
to
behave
.
“They
are
upstairs
with
my
sister
:
they
will
be
down
in
a
few
moments
,
I
dare
say
,
”
had
been
Anne’s
reply
,
in
all
the
confusion
that
was
natural
;
and
if
the
child
had
not
called
her
to
come
and
do
something
for
him
,
she
would
have
been
out
of
the
room
the
next
moment
,
and
released
Captain
Wentwonh
as
well
as
herself
.
He
continued
at
the
window
;
and
after
calmly
and
politely
saying
,
“
I
hope
the
little
boy
is
better
,
”
was
silent
.
She
was
obliged
to
kneel
down
by
the
sofa
,
and
remain
then
:
to
satisfy
her
patient
;
and
thus
they
continned
a
few
minutes
,
when
,
to
her
very
great
satisfaction
,
she
heard
some
other
person
crossing
the
little
vestibule
.
She
hoped
,
on
turning
her
head
,
to
see
the
master
of
the
house
;
but
it
proved
to
be
one
much
less
calculated
for
making
matters
easy
—
Charles
Hayter
,
robably
not
at
all
better
pleased
by
the
sight
of
Captain
(
lVentworth
,
than
Captain
Wentworth
had
been
by
the
sight
of
Anne
.
She
only
attempted
to
say
,
“How
do
you
do
?
Will
not
you
sit
down
?
The
others
will
be
here
presently
.
'
Captain
Wentworth
,
however
,
came
from
his
window
,
apparently
not
ill-disposed
for
conversation
;
but
Charles
Hayter
soon
put
an
end
to
his
attempts
,
by
sating
himself
near
the
table
,
and
taking
up
the
newspaper
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
returned
to
his
window
.
Another
minute
brought
another
addiu'on
.
The
younger
boy
,
a
remarkable
stout
,
forward
child
,
of
two
years
old
,
having
got
the
door
opened
for
him
by
some
one
without
,
made
his
determined
appearance
among
Pluuuron’

and
went
unight
to
the
cafe
to
nee
what
wan
going
on
,
and
put
in
hie
claim
to
anything
good
that
might
be
giving
away
.
.
There
being
nothing
to
be

,
he
could
only
have
some
play
;
and
:
hi

not

he
began

:
She
spoke
to

and
insieted

Once
she
did
contrive
to

In
another
moment
,
however
,
she
found
herself
in
the
state
of
being
relealed
from

;

was

of

Charles
Hayter
seemed
aware
of
being
dighted
,
and
yet
Henrietta
had
sometimes
the
air
of
being
divided
between
them
.
Anne
longed
for
the
power
of
representing
to
them
all
what
they
were
about
,
and
of
pointing
out
Iomc
of
the
evila
they
were

to

She
did
not

attribute

It
war
the

to
her
to
believe
Captain

not
in

aware
of
the
pain
he
waa

There

had

He

been
found
on
the
occasion
by
Mr

with
some

before

Mr

Charles

November

the
Mill

came
through

stopped
for

to
say
,
that
they
were
going

to
take

long

and
therefore
concluded
Mary
could
not

when
Mary
immediately
lied
,
with

jealouty
at
not

,
“
Oh
,
yea
!
I
nhould

Anne
felt

pertuaded
,
by
the
look
:
of
the
two
girll
,
that
it
was
preciaely
what
they
did
not
wish
,
and
admired
again
the
non
of
necessity
which
the
family
habit
:
uerned
to
produce
,
of
everything
being
to
be
communicated
,
and
everything
being
to
be
done

,
however
undesired
and
inconvenient
.
She
tried
to
di-uade
Mary
from
going
,
but
in

;
and
that
being
the

thought
it
beat
to

be

of

Captain

added
:

“Ah

Charles
,
in
the
manwhile
,
was
very
decidedly
declaring
his
resolution
of
calling
on
his
aunt
,
now
that
he
was
so
near
;
and
very
evidently
,
though
more
fearfully
,
t
ng
to
induce
his
wife
to
go
too
.
But
this
was
one
o
the
points
on
which
the
lady
shewed
her
strength
;
and
when
he
recommended
the
advantage
cheating
herself
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
Winthrop
,
as
she
felt
so
tired
,
«he
resolutely
answered
,
“
Oh
,
no
,
indeed
!
walking
up
that
hill
again
would
do
her
more
harm
than
any
sitting
down
could
do
her
good
;
'
and
in
short
,
her
look
and
manner
declared
,
that
go
she
would
not
.
After
a
little
succession
of
these
sort
of
debates
and
consultations
,
it
was
settled
between
Charles
and
his
two
sisters
,
that
he
and
Henrietta
should
run
down
for
a
few
minutes
,
to
see
their
aunt
and
cousins
,
while
the
rest
of
the
party
waited
for
them
at
the
top
of
the
hill
.
Louisa
seemed
the
principal
arranger
of
the
plan
;
and
,
,
as
she
went
a
link
way
with
them
down
the
hill
,
still
talking
to
Henrietta
,
Mary
took
the
opportunity
of
looking
scornfully
around
her
,
and
saying
to
Capuin
Wentworth
—
“
It
is
very
unpleasant
having
such

But

I
assure
you
,
I

'
She
received
no
other
answer
than
an
artiﬁcial
,
assenting
smile
,
followed
by
a
contemptuous
glance
,
as
he
turned
away
,

Anne
perfectly
knew
the

of

the

If
you
value

infuse
as

u
can

But
this

no

,
you
have
been

It

the
worst
evil
of

indecisive

that

My
ﬁrst
wish
for
all
whom
I
am
interested

is
that
they

ﬁlter
a
moment

pause
,
Captain

said
—
“

“Oh

The
sounds
were
retreating

and
Anne
distinguished
no
more

Her
own
emotions
still
kept
her
ﬁxed
.
She
had
much
to
recover
from
before
she
could

The

proverbial
fate
was
not

:
she
had
heard
no

of
herself
,
but
she
had
heard
a
great
deal
of
very
painﬁxl
import
.
She
saw
how
her
own
chancter
was
considered
by
Captain
Wentworth
,
and
there
had
been
just
that
degree
of
Feeling
and
curiosity
about
her
in
his
manner
which
must
give
her
extreme
agitation

to

The

had
crossed
the
lane
,

surmounting
an
opposite
stile

the

was
putting
his

into
motion
again
,
when
Captain
Wentworth
cleared
the
hedge
in
a
moment
,
to
any
something

his

:
they
compressed
themselves
into
the

possible
space
to
leave
her
a
corner
,

Captain
Wentworth
,
without
saying
a
word
,
turned
to
her
,

quietly
obliged
her
to
be
assisted
into

She
was
in

felt
that
he
had
plaCed
her
there
,
that
his
will
and
his

done
it
,
that
she
owed
it
to

a

Captain

and
if

that

They
went
back
to

so

had

people
as
Dr
and
Mrs
Shirley
,
who
have
been
doing
good
all
their
lives
,
wearing
out
their
last
days
in
a
place
like
Uppercross
,
where
,
excepting
our
family
,
they
seem
shut
out
from
all
the
world
.
I
wish
his
friends
would
propose
it
to
him
.
I
really
think
they
ought
.
And
,
as
to
procuring
a
dispensation
,
there
could
be
no
difﬁculty
at
his
time
of
life
and
with
his
character
.
My
only
doubt
is
,
whether
anything
could
persuade
him
to
leave
his
parish
.
He
is
so
ver
strict
and
scrupulous
in
his
notions
;
over-scrupulous
must
say
.
Do
not
you
think
,
Anne
,
it
is
being
,
overscrupulous
?
Do
not
you
think
it
is
quite
a
mistaken
point
of
conscience
,
when
a
clergyman
sacriﬁces
his
health
for
the
sake
of
duties
which
may
be
as
well
performed
by
another
mean
?
And
at
Lyme
,
too
,
only
seventeen
miles
0
,
he
would
be
near
enough
to
hear
if
people
thought
there
was
anything
to
complain
of.”
Anne
smiled
more
than
once
to
herself
during
this
speech
,
and
entered
into
the
subject
,
as
ready
to
do
good
by
entering
into
the
feelings
of
a
young
lady
as
of
a
young
man
,
though
here
it
was
good
of
a
lower
standard
,
for
what
could
be
altered
but
general
acquiescence
?
She
said
all
that
was
reasonable
and
proper
on
the
business
;
felt
the
claims
of
Dr
Shirley
to
repose
as
she
ought
;
saw
how
very
desirable
it
was
that
he
should
have
some
active
,
respectable
young
man
as
a
resident
curate
,
and
was
even
courteous
enough
to
hint
at
the
advantage
of
such
resident
curate’s
being
married
.

“
Putting

said

"
we
must
consider
it
to

the

of
Providence
that
you
should
not

'
When
she
could
command
Ma
’s
attention
,
Anne
quiedy
tried
to
convince
her
that
r
father
and
Mr
Elliot
had
not
,
for
man
years
,
been
on
such
terms
as
to
make
the
power
0
attempting
an
introduction
at
all
deeirahle
.
At
the
same
time
,
however
,
it
was
a
secret
gratiﬁcation
to
herself
to
have
seen
her
courin
,
and
to
know
that
the
future
owner
of
Kellynch
was
undoubtedly
a
gentleman
,
and
had
an
air
of
good
aense
.
She
would
not
,
upon
any
account
,
mention
her
having
met
with
him
the
second
time
;
luckily
Mary
did
not
much
attend
to
their
having
passed
close
by
him
in
their
early
walk
,
but
she
would
have
felt
quite
ill-used
by
Anne
3
having
actually
rnn
against
him
in
the
passage
,
and
received
his
very
polite
excuses
,
while
she
had
never
been
near
him
at
all
;
no
,
that
cousinly
littJe
interview
must
remain
a
perfect
secret
.
“Of

,
'
said
Ma
,
“
you
will
mention
our
seeing
Mr
Elliot
the
next

I
think
my

certainly
ought
to
hear
of
it
;
do
mention
all
about
him

'
Anne
avoided
a
direct
reply
,
but
it
waa
just
the
circumstance
which
she
considered
at
not
merely
unnecessary
to
be
communicated

as

that
could

be
given
to
any

but
Louisa
,
or
those
who
were
wrapped
up
in
her

Captain

was

considerater
attentive
to
her
;
and
,
united
as
they
all
seemed
by
the
distress
of
the

she

at

the
ex

with
which
Charles
was

made

a

reception
of
Anne
;
or
must
at
least
convince
her
that
she
was
valued
only
as
she
could
be
useful
to
Louisa
.
She
endeavoured
to
be
composed
,
and
to
be
just
.
Without
emulating
the
feelings
of
an
Emma
towards
her
Henry
,
she
would
have
attended
on
Louisa
with
a
Zeal
above
the
common
claims

as

In
the

while
she
was

.
He
had
handed
them
both
in
,
and
placed
himself
between
them
;
and
in
this
manner
,
under
these
circumstances
,
full
of
astonishment
and
emotion
to
Anne
,
she
quitted
Lyme
.
How
the
long
stage
would
pass
;
how
it
was
to
edict
their

;
what
was
to
be
their

,
she
could
not
foresee

It
was

felt
that

the

those
of

and
when
Lady

reverted
to
their
former
hopes
and
fears
,
and
spoke
her
satisfaction
in
the
house
in
Camden

which
had
been
taken
,
and
heiregret
that
Mrs

should
still

with

,
Anne
would
have
been

to
have
it
known
how
much
more
she
was
thinking
of
Lyme
and
Louisa
Musgrove
,
and
all
her
acquaintance
there
;
how
much
more
interesting
to
her
was
the
home
and
the
friendship
of
the
Harvilles
and
Captain
Benwick
,
than
her
own
father
s
house
in
Camden
Place
,
or
her
own
sister’s
intimacy
with
Mrs
Clay
.
She
was
actually
forced
to
exert
herself
to
meet
Lady
Russell
with
anything
like
the
appearance
of
equal
solicitude
,
on
topics
which
had
by
nature
the
[
ﬁrst
]
claim
on
her
.
There
was
a
little
awkwardness
at

in
their
dis‘course
on
another
subject
.
Th
must
alt
of
the
accident
at
.
Lyme
.
Lady
Russe
had
not
n
arrived
ﬁve
minutes
the
day
before
,
when
a
full
account
of
the
whole
had
burst
on
her
;
but
still
it
mutt
be
talked
of
,
she
must
make
enquiries
,
she
must
regret
the
impm
—
dence
,
lament
the
result
,
and
Captain
Wentworth’s
name
must
be
mentioned
by
both
.
Anne
was
conscious
of
not
doing
it
so
well
as
Lady
Russell
.
She
could
not
speak
the
name
,
and
look
straight
forward
to
Lady
Russell’s
e
e
,
till
she
had
adopted
the
expedient
of
telling
her
brieﬂy
what
she
thought
of
the
attachment
between
him
and
Louisa
.
When
this
was
told
,
his
name
distressed
her
no
longer
.
Lady
Russell
had
only
to
listen
composedly
,
and
wish
them
happy
,
but
internally
her
heart
revelled
in
angry
pleasure
,
in
leased
contempt
,
that
the
man
who
at
twenty-three
ha
seemed
to
understand
somewhat
of
the
value
of
an
Anne
Elliot
,
should
,
eight
years
afterwards
,
be
charmed
by
a
Louisa
Musgrove
.
The

three

passed
most

and

of

At
the

end
of
that
period
,
Lady
Runell'a
politeneu
could
repole
no
longer
,
and
the
fainter
cell-threatening
:
of
the
st
became
in
a
decided
tone
,
“I

Anne
did
not
shrink
from
it
:
on
the
contrary
,
the
lnrly
felt
n
the
laid
,
in
observing
—
“

are
lest

change
than
mine
.
By
remaining
in
the
neighbourhood
,
I
am
become
inured
to
it.”
She
could
have
said
more
on
the
subject
,
for
she
had
in
fact
so
high
an
opinion
of
the
Crafts
,
and
oonlidered
her
father
to

Lady
Russell
would

in

house

,

the
well-known
apartments
.
In

Anne

Mrs
Croft
always
met
her
with
a
kindness
which
gave
her
the
pleasure
of
fancying
henelf
a
favourite
,
and
on
the
present
occaeion
,
receiving
her
in

house
,
there
via-Lparticular
attention
.
The
accident
at
Lyme
was
soon
the
prevailing
topic
,
and
on
comparing
their
latest
accounts
of
the
invalid
,
it
appeared
that
each
lady
dated
her
intelligence
from
the
same
hour
of
yettennom
;
that
Captain
Wentworth
had
been
in
Kellyncll
yeeterday
(
the
lint
time
since
the
accident
)
,
had
brought
Anne
the
last
note
,

,
and
without
any

intention
of

it
any

He
had
enquired
after
her
,

,
particularly
;
had
ex
rcssed
his
hope
of
Mice
Elliot’s
not

gar
her
exemonl
,
and
had
spoken
of
there
exertions
as
great
.
This
was
handsome
,
and
gave
her
more
pleasure
than
almost
anything
else
could
have
done
.
As
to
the
sad
catastrophe
itself
,
it
could
be
canvassed
only
in
one
style
by
a
couple
of
mdy
,
sensible
women
,
whoee
judgments
had
to
work
on
ascertained
events
;
and
it
was
perfectly
decided
that
it
had
been
the
conseuence
of
much
thoughtfulness
and
much
imprudcnce

the

had
been

to

every

and
,
in

it
seemed
to
have
been
only
a
Itruggle
on

side
,
at
to
which
thould

Mary
had
had
her
evil
'

upon
the
whole
,
as
wan
evident
by
her
staying
so
long
,
she
had
found
more

to

CharleHayter
had
been
at

oftener
than
Iuited

;
and
when

dined
With

there
had
been
only
a
maid-servant
to
wait
,
and
at
ﬁrst
Mrs

given

then
the
had
received

an
apology
from

on
ﬁnding
out

there

there

;
!
between
their
lodgings
and
the
Harvilles
,
and
she
had
got
books
from
the
library
,
and
changed
them
so
often
,
that
the
balance
had
certainly
been
much
in
favour
of
Lyme
.
She
had
been
taken
to
Charmouth
too
,
and
she
had
bathed
,
and
she
had
gone
to
church
,
and
there
were
a
great
many
more
people
to
look
at
in
the
church
at
Lyme
than
at
Uppercross
;
and
all
this
,
joined
to
the
sense
of
being
so
very
useful
,
had
made
really
an
agreeable
fortnight
.
Anne
in
uired
after
Captain
Benwick
.
Mary
s
face
was
clouded
directly
.
Charles
laughed
.
"
0h
!
Captain
Benwiek
is
very
well
,
[
I
]
believe
,
but
he
is
a
very
odd
young
man
.
I
do
not
know
what
he
would
be
at
.
We
asked
him
In
come
home
with
ml
for
a
day
or
two
:
Charles
undertook
to
ve
him
come
shooting
,
and
he
seemed
quite
deligh
and
,
for
my
Kart
,
I
thought
it
was
all
settled
,
when
,
beholdl
on
uesday
night
,
he
made
a
very
awkward
sort
of
an
excuse
;
'
he
never
shot
,
’
and
he
had
‘been
quite
milundemood
,
’
and
he
had
promised
this
and
he
had
promised
that
,
and
the
end
of
it
was
,
I
found
,
that
he
did
not
mean
to
come
.
I
sup
se
he
was
afraid
of
ﬁnding
it
dull
;
but
upon
my
wo
I
should
have
though
!
we
were
lively
enough
at
the
Cottage
for
such
a
heartbroken
man
as
Ca
tain
Benwick.’
Charles
laugh
again
,
and
said
,
“Now
,
Ma
,
you
know
very
well
how
it
reall
was
.
It
was
all
your
doing
,
”
(
turning
to
Anne
.
)
"
e
fancied
that
if
he
went
with
us
he
should
ﬁnd
ou
close
by
:
he
fancied
everybody
to
be
living
in

;
and
when
he
discovered
that
Lady

lived
three

of

his

failed

he
had
not

That
is
the
fact
,
upon

honour

Mary
knows
it
is.”
But
Mary
did
not

it
very

been

A

had

,
and
he
wan
now
nite
a
dlﬂ'erent
cream
from
what
he
had
been
the

.
He
had
not
seen
Louisa
;
and
was
an
extremely
frful
of
any
ill
consequence
to
her
from
an
interview
,
that
he
did
not
pres

for
it
at

and
,
on
the
contrary
,
eeemed
to
have
a
plan
of
going
away
for
a
week
or
ten
days
,
till
her
head
was
stronger
.
He
had
talked
of
gorng
down
to
Plymouth
fur
a
week
,
and
wanted
to
nude
Captain
Benwick
to
go
with
him
;
but
,
an
harlet
maintained
to
the
Ian
.
Captain
Benwick
leaned
much
more
diapoled
to

over
to
Kellynch

There
can
be
no
doubt
that
Lad
Russell
and
Anne
were
both
oecalionnlly
thinking
0
Captain
Benwick
,
from
thin
time
.
Lady
Russell
could
not

feeling
that

in

,
or
any

in

,
without
wondering
whether
she
might
see
him
or
hear
of

.
Ca

Benwick
came
not
,
however
.
He
was
either
ecu
disposed
for
it
than
Charles
had
imagined
,
or
he
was
too
shy
;
and
after
giving
him
a
week’s
indulgence
,
Lady
Russell
determined
him
to
he
unworthy
of
the
interest
which
he
had
been
beginning
to
excite
.
The
Mu

came
back
to
receive
their
ha

boys
and
from
school
,
bringing
with
them
rs
Hsrville’s
little
children
,
to
improve
the
noise
of
Uppercross
,
and
lessen
that
of
Lyme
.
Henrictu
remained
with
Louisa
,
but
all
the
rest
of
the
family
were

in

Though
neither
Henrietta
,

,

Hayter

Captain
Wentworth

,
the
room
presented
as

was

children
from

,
expreuly
to

On

side
was
a

occupied
by
some
chattering

,

up

and
on

A
degree
of
unexpected
cordiality
,
however
,
in
the
welcome
the
received

did
her
good
.

of
being
deeply

in

Anne
could

of
it
.
Colonel
Wallis
had
known
Mr
Elliot
long
,
had
been
well
acquainted
alto
with
hie
wife
,
had
perfectly
understood
the
whole
story
.
She
was
certainly
not
a
woman
of
family
,
but
well
educated
,
accomplithed
,
rich
,
and
exoeuively
in
love
with
hie
friend
.
There
had
been
the
charm
.
She
had
taught
him
.
Without
that
attraction
,
not
all

money
would
have
tempted
Elliot
,
and
Sir
Walter

love
with

Sir
Walter
seemed
to
admit
it
as
complete
apology
;
and
though
Elizabeth
could
not
see
the
circumstance
in
quite
so
favourable
a
light
,
she
allowed
it
to
be
a
great
extenuation
.
Mr
Elliot
had
called
repeatedly
,
had
dined
with
them
once
,
evidently
delighted
by
the
distinction
of
being
asked
,
for
they
gave
no
dinners
in
.
general
;
delighted
,
in
short
,
by
every
proof
of
cousinly
notice
,
and
placing
his
whole
happiness
in
being
on
intimate
terms
in
Camden
Place
.
Anne
listened
,
but
without
quite
understanding
it
.
Allowances
,
large
allowances
must
be
made
for
the
ideas
of
those
who
spoke
.
She
heard
it
all
under
embellishment
.
All
that
sounded
extravagantorimtional
in
the
progress
of
the
reconciliation
might
have
no
origin
but
in
the
language
of
the
relators
.
Still
,
however
,
she
had
the
sensation
of
there
being
something
more
than
immediately
appeared
.
in
Mr
Elliot’s
wishing
,
after
an
interval
of
so
many
years
,
to
be
well
received
by
them
.
In
a
worldly
view
,
he
had
nothing
to
gain
by
being
on
terms
with
Sir
Walter
;
nothing
to
risk
by
a
state
of
variance
.
In
all
probability
he
was
already
the
richer
of
the
two
,
and
the
Kellynch
estate
would
as
surely
be
his
hereafter
as
the
title
.
A
sensible
man
,
and
he
had
looked
like
a
«my

,
why
should
it
be
an
object
to
him
?
She
could
only
offer
one
solution
:
it
was
,

,
for
Elizabeth’s

.

mentioned
the

had

without

He
did

Mr

,

in

were
talked
of

He
longed
to
see
her
.
e
she
might
make

amende
for
the
many
very
ain
faces
hewae
continually
panning
in
the
streets
.
Tlie
worst
of
Bath
was
the
number
of
its
plain
women
.
He
did
not
mean
to
say
that
there
were
no
pretty
women
,
but
the
number
of
the
plain
wan
out
of
all
proportion
.
He
had
frequently
observed
,
as
he
walked
,
that
one
handwme
face
would
be
followed
by
thirty
,
or
live-and-thirty
fright
:
;
and
once
,
as
he
had
wood
m
a
shop
in
Bond
Street
,
he
had
counted
eighty-seven
women
go
by
,
one
after
another
,
without
there
being
a
tolerable
face
among
them
.
It
had
been
a
frotty
morning
,
to
be
sure
,
a
sharp
front
,
which
hardly
one
woman
in
a
thousand
could
stand
the
test
of
.
But
still
,
there
certainly
were
a
dreadful
multitude
of
ugly
women
in
Bath
;
and
as
for
the
men
!
they
were
inﬁnitely
worse
.
Such
scarecrowat
the
streets
were
full
of
!
It
was
evident
how
little
the
women
were
used
to
the
eight
of
anything
tolerable
,
by
the
effect
which
a
man
of
decent
appearance
produced
.
He
had
never
walked
anywhere
nrm-in-arm
with
Colonel
Wnlliu
(
who
was

,

sandy-haired

without

He
was
not
allowed
to

,
however
.
His

united
in

there
had
just
been
a
decent
pretence
on
the
lady’s
side
of
meaning
to
lave
them
.
She
could
imagine
Mrs
Clay
to
have
said
,
that
“now
Miss
Anne
was
come
,
she
could
not
suppose
herself
at
all
wanted
;
'
for
Elizabeth
was
replying
in
a
sort
of
whisper
,
“That
must
not
be
any
reason

indeed
.
I
assure
you
I
feel
it
none
.
She
is
nothing

"
and
she
was
in
full

to
hear
her
father
say
,
“

He
spoke
and
looked
so
much
in
eamest
.
that
Anne
was
not
surprised
to
see
Mrs

stealing
a
glance
at

herself

some
watchfulness

the
praise
of

did
not

having
been
a
suspension
of
all
intercourse
by
letters
of
ceremony
,
ever
since
the
death
of
that
said
late
Viscount
,
when
,
in
consequence
of
a
dangerous
illness
of
Sir
Walter’s
at
the
same
time
,
there
had
been
an
unlucky
omission
at
Kellynch
.
No
letter
of
condolence
had
been
sent
to
Ireland
.
The
neglect
had
been
visited
on
the
head
of
the
sinner
;
for
when
poor
Lady
Elliot
died
herself
,
no
letter
of
condolence
was
received
at
Kellynch
,
and
,
consequently
,
there
was
but
too
much
reason
to
s
prehcntl
that
the
Dalrymples
considered
the
relationalin
as
Closed
.
How
to
have
this
anxious
busineu
set
to
rights
,
and
be
admitted
as
cousins
again
,
was
the
question
:
and
it
was
a
question
which
,
in
a
more
rational
manner
,
neither
Lady
Russell
nor
Mr
Elliot
thought
unimportant
.
“
Family
coonexions
were
always
worth
reserving
,
good
company
always
worth
seeking
;
Lady
alr
ple
had
taken
a
house
,
for
three
months
,
in
Laura
lace
,
and
would
be
living
in
style
.
She
had
been
at
Bath
the
year
before
,
and
Lady
Russell
had
heard
her
spoken
of
as
a
charming
woman
.
It
was
very
desirable
that
the
connexion
should
be
renewed
,
if
it
could
be
done
,
without
any
compromise
of
propriety
on
the
side
of
the
Elliots
.
'
Sir
Walter
,
however
,
would
choose
his
own
means
,
and
at
last
wrote
a
very
ﬁne
letter
of
ample
ex
lanation
,
regret
,
and
entreaty
,
to
his
right
honour-ab
e
cousin
.
Neither
Lady
Russell
nor
Mr
Elliot
could
admire
the
letter
;
but
it
did
all
that
was
wanted
,
in
bringing
three
lines
of
scrawl
from
the
Dowager
Viscountess
.
“She
was
very
much
honoured
,
and
should
be
happy
in
their
acquaintance.”
The
toils
of
the
business
were
over
,
the
sweets
began
.
They
visited
in
Laura
Place
,
they
had
the
cards
of
Dowager
Viscountess
Dalrymple
,
and
the
Honourable
Miss
Carteret

to
be
arranged
wherever
they
might

Walter
and
Elizabeth
were
auiduounly
pushing
their
good
fortune
in
Laura
Place
,
Anne
wan
renewing
an
acquaintance
of
a
very
different
description
.
She
had
called
on
her
former
governeaI
,
and
had
heard
from
her
of
there
being
an
old
Ichoolfellow
in
Bath
,
who
had
the
two
Itrong
claim
:
on
her
attention
of
past
kindneu
and
present
suffering
.
Mia
:
Hamilton
,
now
Mn
Smith
,
had
shewn
her
kindneu
in
one
of
thoae
period
;
of
her
life
when
it
had
been
moot
valuable
.
Anne
had
gone
unhappy
to
school
,
grieving
for
the
lost
of
a
mother
whorri
the
had
dearly
loved
,
feeling
her
separation
from
home
,
and
suffering
to
a
girl
of
fourteen
,
of
strong
lensibilit
and
not
high
Ipirila
,
mutt
lufl'er
at
such
a
time
;
and
ﬁlial
:
Hamilton
,
three
your
:
older
than
herself
,
but
still
,
from
the
want
of
near
relation
!
and
a
rattled
home
,
remaining
another
year
at
achool
,
had
been
uleful
and
good
to
her
in
a
way
which
had
connidernbly
lcuened
her
misery
,
and
could
never
be
remembered
with
indifierence
.
Mia
Hamilton
had
left
uhool
,
had
manicd
not
long
afterwards
,
wu
laid
to
have
married
a
man
of
fortune
,
and
this
was
all
that
Anne
had
known
of
her
,
till
now
reasmsron
.
r

that
their
govemess’s
account
brought
her
situation
forward
in
a
more
decided
but
very
diﬂ‘erent
form
.
She
was
a
widow
,
and
poor
.
Her
hudssnd
had
been
extravagant
;
and
at
his
death
,
about
two
year
!
before
,
had
left
his
alfairs
dreadfully
involved
.
She
had
had
difﬁculties
of
every
sort
to
contend
with
,
and
in
addition
to
these
distlesses
had
been
afﬂicted
with
a
severe
rheumatic
fever
,
which
,
ﬁnally
settling
in
her
legs
,
had
made
her
for
the
present
a
cripple
.
She
had
come
to
Bath
on
that
account
,
and
was
now
in
lodgin
s
near
the
hot
baths
,
living
in
a
very
humble
way
,
nnah
e
even
to
nﬁ'ord
hen-elf
the
comfort
of
a
servant
,
and
of
course
almost
excluded
from
society
.
Their
mutual
friend
answered
for
the
satisfaction
which
a
visit
from
Miss
Elliot
would
give
Mrs
Smith
,
and
Anne
therefore
lost
no
time
in
oiug
.
She
mentioned
nothing
of
what
she
had
he
:
,
or
what
she
in
—
tended
,
at
home
.
It
would
excite
no
roper
interest
there
.
She
only
consulted
Lady
Russel
,
who
entered
thorougth
into
her
sentiments
,
and
was
most
ha
to
convc
her
as
near
to
Mrs
Smith’s
lodgings
,
in
estgate
uildings
,
as
Anne
chose
to
be
taken
.
The
visit
was
paid
,
their
acquaintance
re-eslnblishcd
,
their
interest
in
each
other
more
than
rekindled
.
The
ﬁrst
ten
minutes
had
its
awkwardness
and
its
emotion
.
Twelve
years
were
gone
since
they
had
parted
,
and
each
presented
a
somewhat
different
person
from
what
the
other
had
ima
‘ned
.
Twelve
years
had
changed
Anne
from
the
booming
,
silent
,
unforrned
girl
of
ﬁfteen
,
to
the
el
ant
little
woman
of
seven-andtwenty
,
with
every
auty
excepting
bloom
,
and
with
manners
as
consciously
right
as
they
were
invarishly
gentle
;
and
twelve
years
had
transfomlcd
the
ﬁne-looking
,
well
—
grown
Miss
Hamilton
,
in
all
the
glow
of
health
and
conﬁdence
of
superiority
,
into
a
poor
,
inﬁrm
,
helpless
widow
,
receiving

visit
of

,
but
all
that
won
uncomfortable
in
the
meeting
had
noon
paued
away
.
and
left
onl
the
interesting
charm
of
remembering
former
partiahtiet
and
talking
our
old
times.
'
Anne
found
in
Mra
Smith
the
good
aeme
and
agree
.
able
manner
.
which
the
had
almoat
ventured
to
d
on
,
and
a
diepoeition
to
convene
and
be
cheerful
beyond
her
expectation
.
Neither
the
dinipationa
of
the
put
—
and
the
load
lived
very
much
in
the
world
—
nor
the
reatrictiom
of
the
prelenl
,
neither
aicltneu
nor
sorrow
aeemed
to
have
cloned
her
heart
or
ruined
her
apiritu
.
In
the
courae
of
n
necond
viait
she
talked
with
great
opennela
,
and
Anne’a
astoniehlnent
increaaed
.
She
could
ocarcely
imagine
a
more
cheerlen
situation
in
itself
than
Mrs
Smith'e
.
She
had
been
ve
fond
of
her
husband
:
the
had
hurled
him
.
She
had
n
need
to
aﬂluence
:
it
wan
gone
.
She
had
no
child
to
connect
her
with
life
and
happineu
again
,
no
relation
:
to
aaaiat
in
the
arrangement
of
pe
lexed
affairs
,
no
health
to
make
all
the
rent
mpporta
le
.
Her
accommodationa
were
limited
to
a
nouy
parlour
,
and
a
dark
bedroom
behind
,
with
no
ponibility
of
moving
from
one
to
the
other
without
auittance
,
which
there

only

the
house
to

,
and
Ill

never
quitted
the
houae
but
to
be
conveyed
into
the
warm
bath
.
Yet
,
in
Ipite
of
all
this
,
Anne
had
xenon
to
believe
that
the
had
momenta
only
of
languor
and
depreuion
to
hourt
of
occupation
and
enjoyment
.
How
oould
it
be
?
She
watched
,
ohaerved
,
reﬂected
,
and
ﬁnall
determined
that
this
was
not
a
case
of
fortitude
or
o
reaignation
only

loyment
which
carried
her
out
of
herself
;
which
was
mm
nature
alone
.
It
was
the
choicest
iﬁ
of
Heaven
;
and
Anne
viewed
her
friend
me
one
o
thoae
instances
in
which
,
by
a
merciful
appointment
,
it
seems
designed
to
counterbalance
almost
eve
other
want
.
,
There
had
been
a
time
,
rs
Smith
told
her
,
when
her
spirits
had
nearly
failed
.
She
could
not
call
herself
an
invalid
now
,
compared
with
her
state
on
ﬁrst
reaching
Bath
.
Then
she
had
,
indeed
,
been
a
pitiable
object
;
for
the
had
caught
cold
on
the
journey
,
and
had
hardly
taken
possession
of
her
lodginga
before
the
was
again
conﬁned
to
her
bed
,
and
suKering
under
severe
and
constant
pain
;
and
all
this
among
strangers
,
with
the
absolute
necessity
of
having
a
regular
nurse
,
and
ﬁnanoea
at
that
moment
particulatrly
unﬁt
to
meet
any
extraordinary
expense
.
She
had
weathered
it
,
however
,
and
could
truly
say
that
it
had
done
her
good
.
It
had
increased
her
comforts
by
making
her
feel
herself
to
be
in
good
hands
.
She
had
seen
too
much
of
the
world
to
expect
audden
or
disinterested
attachment
anywhere
,
but
her
illneaa
had
proved
to
her
that
her
landlady
had
a
character
to
preserve
,
and
would
not
use
her
ill
;
and
she
had
been
particularly
fortunate
in
her
nurse
,
u
a
sitter
of
her
landlady
,
a
nurse
by
profeaaion
,
and
who
had
ulwayr
a
home
in
that
house
when
unemployed
,
chanced
to
be
at
liberty
in
time
to
attend
her
.
uAnd
she
,
”
said
Mrs
Smith
,
“besides
nursing
me

admirably
,
hat

roved

.
As
soon
as
I
co

she
taught
me
to
ltnit
,
which
has
been
a
great
amusement
;
and
she
put
me
in

,

:
,
“there

Anne
saw
the
misery
of
such
feelings
.
The
husband
had
not
been
what
he
ought
,
and
the
wife
had
been
led
among
that
rt
of
mankind
which
made
her
think
worse
.
of
the
worl
than
she
hoped
it
deserved
.
It
was
but
1
‘ng
emotion
,
however
,
with
Mrs
Smith
;
she
shook
It
off
,
and
soon
added
in
I
different
tone—
“I
do
not
suppose
the
situation
my
friend
Mrs
Roche
is
in
at
present
will
furnish
much
either
to
interest
or
me
.
She
is
only
nursing
Mrs
Willie
of
Marlborough
Buildings
;
a
mere
pretty
,
silly
,
expensive
,
fashionable
woman
,
I
believe
;
and
of
course
will
have
nothing
to
report
but
of
lace
and
linery
.
I
mean
to
make
my
proﬁt
of
Mrs
Wallis
,
however
.
She
has
plenty
of
man
,
and
I
intend
she
shall
buy
all
the
high-priced
things
have
in

now.”
Anne
had
called
several
dmes

her
friend
,
before
the
existence
of
such
a
person
was
known
in

distant
table
,
and
,
leaning
there
in
pretended
employment
,
try
to
subdue
the
feelings
this
‘cture
excited
.
For
a
few
moments
her
imagination
an
her
heart
were
bewitched
.
The
idea
of
becoming
what
her
mother
had
been
;
of
having
the
precious
name
of
“
Lady
Elliot”
ﬁrst
revived
in
herself
;
of
being
restored
to
Kellynch
,
calling
it
her
home
again
,
her
home
for
ever
,
was
a
charm
which
she
could
not
immediately
resist
.
Lady
Russell
said
not
another
word
,
willing
to
leave
the
matter
to
its
own
operation
;
and
believing
that
,
could
Mr
Elliot
at
that
moment
with
propriety
have
s
lten
for
himself
l
—
she
believed
,
in
short
,
what
Anne
d
not
believe
.
The
same
image
of
Mr
Elliot
speak,
ing
for
himself
brought
Anne
to
composure
a
'
.
The
charm
of
Kellynch
and
of
“
Lady
Elliot’
all
faded
away
.
She
never
could
accent
him
.
And
it
was
not
only
that
her
feelings
were
still
adverse
to
any
man
save
one
;
her
judgment
,
on
a
serious
consideran'on
of
the
possibilities
of
such
a
case
,
was
against
Mr
Elliot
.
Though
they
had
now
been

a

,
she
could
not

satisﬁed
that
she

knew

That

this
was

enough
.

was

,

on

,
to
derive
much
more

She

Well

this
Min
Lnuila
,
we
all
thought
,
you
know
,
was
to
marry
Frederick
.
He
war
courting
her
week
after
week
.
The
only
wonder
on
,
what
they
could
be
waiting
for
,
till

;
then
,
indeed
,
it
was
clear
enough
that
they
muat
wait
.
till
her

waeet
to
right
.
But
even
then
there
war
Iornething
odd
in
their
way
of
going
on
.
Inatead
of
ataying
at
Lyme
,
he
went
oﬂ‘
to
Plymoudr
,
and
then
he
went
off
to
nee
Edward
.
When
we
came
back
from
Minehead
he
was
gone
down
to
Edward’e
,
and
there
he
has
been
ever
since
.
We
have
teen
nothing
of
him
aince
November
.
Em
Sophy
could
not
undemnd
it

for

with

that

were

;
Miss

she
eat
near

window
,
descned
,
most
decidedly
and
distinctly
,
Captain
Wentwotth
walking
down
the
street
.
Her
start
was
perceptible
only
to
herself
;
but
she
intrantly
felt
that
she
was
the
greatest
simpleton
in
the
world
,
the
most
unaccountable
and
absurd
!
For
a
few
minute
.
she
saw
nothing
before
her
:
it
was
all
confusion
.
She
was
lost
,
and
when
the
had
scolded
back
her
sen-es
,
she
found
the
others
still
waiting
for
the
carriage
,
and
Mr

(

setting
off
for

0
Mrs
Cla

.
.
She
now
felt
a
great
inclinaan
to
go
to
the
outer
door
;
she
wanted
to
see
if
it
rained
.
Why
was
the
to
suspect
herself
of
another
motive
?
Captain
Wentworth
mun
be
out
of
sight
.
She
left
her
seat
,
she
would
go

one
half
of
her
should

She
wool
see

She
was
sent
back
,
however
,
in
a
moment
,
by
the
entrance
of
Captain
Wentworth
himself
,
among
s
party
of
gentlemen
and
ladies
,
evidently
his
acquaintance
,
and
whom
he
must
have
joined
a
little
below
Milsom
Street
.
He
was
more
obviously
struck
and
confused
by
the
right
of
her
than
she
had
ever
observed
before
;
he
looked
quite
red
.
For
the
ﬁrst
time
since
their
renewed
acquaintance
,
she
felt
that
she
was
betraying
the
least
sensibility
of
the
two

Mr

wanot

Mn

had
been
carried
away
from
her
ﬁrst
direction

Anne
had

in

interett
of
her

,
how
much
had
been
originally

attention
was

:
liatened
to
a
recital
which
,
if
it
did
not
perfectl
jultify
the
unqualiﬁed
bitterness
of
Mn

prov
him
to
have
been
very
unfeeling
in
hit
conduct
towardher
;
very
deﬁcient
both
in
juttice
and
companion
.
She
learned
that
(
the
intimacy
between
them
continuing
unimpaired
by
Mr
Elliot

marriage
)
they
had
been
a
before
alwayl
together
,
and
Mr

had
led
hit
ﬁ-iend
into
expentel
much
beyond
his
fortune

not

to

,
and
that
from
the
lint
there
ad
been
a

deal

and
joint

.
From
his
wife’s
account
of
him
she
could
discern
Mr
Smith
to
have
been
a
man
of
warm
feelings
,
easy
temper
,
careless
habits
,
and
not
strong
understanding
;
much
more
amiable
than
his
friend
,
and
very
unlike
him
,
led
by
him
,
and
probably
despised
him
.
Mr
Elliot
.
raised
hyhis
marriage
to
great
uence
,
and
'
to
every
gratiﬁcation
of
pleasure
and
vanity
which
could
be
commanded
without
.
involving
himself
(
for
withall
his
self-indulgence
he
had
become
a
prudent
man
)
,
snd
beginning
to
be
rich
,
just
as
his
friend
ought
to
have
found
himnelf
to
be
poor
,
seemed
to
have
had
no
concern
at
all
for
that
friend’s
probableﬁnances
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
had
been
prompting
and
encouraging
expenses
which
could
end
only
in
ruin
:
and
the
Smiths
accordingl
had
been
mined
.
The
husband
had
died
‘ust
in
time
to
be
spared
the
full
knowledge
of
it

hey
had
previously
known
embarrassment
:
enough
to
try
the
friendship
of
their

,
and
to
prove
that
Mr
Elliot
s
had
better
not
be
tried
;
but
it
was
not
till
his
death
that
the
wretched
state
of
his
affairs
was
fully
known
.
With
a
conﬁdence
in
Mr
Elliot’s
regard
,
more
creditable
to
his
feelings
than
his
judgment
,
Mr
Smith
had
appointed
him
the
executor
of
his
will

but
Mr

would
not
act

it
immediately
occurred
,
that
something
might
be
done
in

fsvour
by
the
inﬂuence
of
the
woman
he
loved
,
snd
she
had
been
hastily
preparing

interest
Anne’s
feelings
as
fsr
as
the
Observances
due
to
Mr
Elliot’s
character
would
allow
,
when
Anne’s
refutation
of
the
su
engagement
changed
the
face
of
everything
;
I
while
it
took
from
her
the
new-formed
he
of
succeeding
in
the
object
of
her
ﬁrst
anxiety
,
left
er
at
least
the
comfort
of
telling
the
whole
story
her
own
way
.
After
listening
to
this
full
description
of
Mr
Elliot
,
Anne
could
not
but
express
some
surprise
at
Mrs
Smith's
having
spoken
of
him
so
favounbly
in
the
beginning
of
their
conversation
.
“
She
had
seemed
to
recommend
and
praise
him
i
”
“My
dear
,
”
was
Mrs
Smith’s
reply
,
“there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
.
I
considered
your
marrying
him
as
certain
,
though
he
might
not
yet
have
made
the
offer
,
and
I
could
no

speak
the
truth
of
him

than
if
he
had
been
your

.
My
heart
bled
for
you
as
I
talked
of
happiness
;
and
yet
he
is
sensible
,
he
is
agreesble
,
and
with
such
a
woman
as
you
,
it
was
not
absolutel

He
was

unkind

But
she
was
tooi

and

for

,
and

I
was
wiling
to
hope
that
you

'
V
Anne
could
just
acknowledge
within
herself
such
a
posI'bility
of
having
been
induced
to
marry
him
,
as'
made
her
shudder
at
the
idea
of
the
misery
which
must
have
followed
.
It
was
just
possible
that
she
might
have
been
persuaded
by
Lady
Russell
!
And
under
such
a
su

,

PERSUASION.

The
revolution
which
one
instant
had
made
in
Anne
was
almost
beyond
exyression
.
The
letter

with

to
“
Miss

'
was
evidently
the
one
which
he
had
been
folding
so
hastily

While

be
writing

he
had

also
addressing
her
I
On
the
contenta
of
that
letter
depended
all
which
this

could
do
for
her
.
Anything
was
possible
,
anything
might
be
deﬁed
rather
than

Mrs

arrangements

,
sinking
into
the
chair
which
he
had
occupied
,
succeeding
to
the
very
spot
where
he
had
luned
and
written
,
her‘
eyes
devoured
the
following
words
:
“I

In

:

enough

their

the

,

'
indeed
,
and
prepare
it
for
all
the
immortality
which
the
happiest
recollections
of
their
own
future
lives
could
bestow
.
There
they
exchanged

And
there
,
as
they

heedless
of

around
them
,
seeing
neither
sauntering

hustling
housekeepers

they

those
retrospectionl
and
acknowledgments
,
and
especially
in
those
explanations
of
what
had
directly
preceded
the
resent
moment
,
which
were
so
poignant
and
so

in

.
All
the

omitted
to

in
