Mr
Bingley
had
soon
made
himself
acquainted
with
all
the
prinei
people
in
the
room
;
he
was
lively
and
unreeerved
,
need
every
dance
,
was
angry
that
the
ball
closed
an
earl
,
and
talked
of

.
What
a
contrast
between
him
and
his
friend
!
Mr
Darcy
danced
only
once
with
Mrs
Hunt
and
once
with
Miss
Bingley
,
declined
being
introduced
to
any
other
lady
,
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
walking
about
the
room
,
king
occasionally
to
one
of
his
own
party
.
His
(
thruster
was
decided
.
He
was
the
loudest
,
moot
disagreeable
man
in
the
world
,
and
eve
y
hoped
that
he
would
never
come
there
a
ain
.
Amongst
the
most
violent
against
him
was
Mrs
ennet
,
whoue
dislike
of
his
general
behaviour
was
sharpened
into
cular
reoentment
by
his
having
elighted
one
of
er
daughters
.
Elimbeth
Bennet
had
been
obliﬁd
,
by
the
scarcity
of
gentlemen
,
to
sit
down
for
two
races
;
and
during
part
of
that
time
,
Mr
Darcy
had
been
mnding
near
enon
h
for
her
to
overhear
s
convemtion
between
him
and
r
Bingley
,
who
came
from
the
dance
for
a
few
minutes
,
to
press
his
friend
to
join
it
.
“Come
,
Darcy
,
'
said
he
,
“I
must
have
you
dance
.
I
hate
to
see
you
mnding
about
by
ourself
in
thin
stupid
manner
.
You
had
much
the
:
dance.”
"
I
certainly
Ihall
not

You

how
I
dent
it
,
unleu
I
am

such
an
assembly
as
this
it
would
be

Your

are
engaged
,
and
there
is
not
another
woman
in
the
room
whom
it
would
not
be
a
punishment
to
me
to
stand
up
with.”
“I
would
not
be
so
ﬁrstidious
as
you
are
,
cried
Bingley
,
“
for
a
kingdom
!
Upon
my
honour
,
I

;

there
are
several
of

see
uncommonly
pretty
.

“Tau

with
the
only
handsome
girl
in
the
room
,
”
said
Mrﬁhrcy
,
looking
at
the
eldest
Miss
Bennet
.
“Oh
!
the
is
the
most
beautiful
creature
I
ever
beheld
!
But
there
is
one
of
her
sisters
sitting
down
just
behind
you
,
who
is
very
pretty
,
and
I
dare
say
very
agreenhle
.
Do
let
me
ask
my
partner
to
introduce
u
.
“
Which
do
you
mean
?
”
and
turning
round
he
looked
for
a
moment
at
Elizabeth
,
till
catching
her
eye
,
he
withdrew
his
own
and
coldly
said
,
“
She
is
tolerable
,
but
not
handsome
ennugh

.and
I
am
in
no
humour
at

You
had
tter
return
to
your
partner
and
enjoy
her
smiles
,
for
you
are
wasting
your
time
with
me
.
'
Mr
Bingley
followed
his
advice
.
Mr
Darcy
walked
05‘
;
and
Elizabeth
remained
with
no
very
cordial
feelings
towards
him
.
She
told
the
story
,
however
,
with
great
irit
among
her
friends
;
for
she
had
a
lively
,
playﬁil
disposition
,
which
delighted

Mrs

admired

Mr
Bingley
had
danced
with
her
twice
,
and
she
had
been
distinguished
by
his
sisters
.
Jane
was
as
much
gratiﬁed
by
this
as
her

be

in

quieter
way

Eliubeth

Mary

heard
herself
mentioned
to
Miss

as
the
most
accomplished
girl
in

;
and
Catherine

had
been
fortunate
enough
to
be
never

partners
,
which
was
all
that
they

and
of

they
were

They
found
Mr

still
up
.
With

he
was
regardless
of

;
and
on

nothing

Everybody
said

though

his

of
being

was
continually
giving
oﬂ'euce

The
manner
in
which
they
epoke
of
the
Meryton
assembly
was
suﬂiciently
characteristic

had
never

every

;
he
had
soon
felt
acquainted
with
all

;
and
as
to
Miss
Bennet
,
he
could
not
conceive
an
angel
more
beautiful
.
Darcy
,
on
the

,
had
teen
a
collection
of
people
in
whom
there
was
little
beauty
and
no

,
for

of
whom
he
had

still

superciliousness
in

treatment
of

hardly

I'lwugh
their
kindness

such
as
it
was
,
had
a
value
as
arising
in
all
probability
from
the
inﬂuence
of
their
brother’s
admiration
.
It
was
generally
evident
whenever
they
met
,
that
he
ﬁll
admire

;
and
to

it
was
equally
evident
that
Jane

she

for

wi

did
Sir

her

had

four

to
a
Mr
Philips
,
who
had
been
a
clerk
to
their
father
and
succeeded
him
in
the
business
,
and
a
brother
settled
in
London
in
a
respectable
line
of
trade
.
The
village
of
Longbourn
was
only
one
mile
from
Meryton
;
a
most
convenient
distance
for
the
young
ladies
,
who
were
usually
tempted
thither
three
or
four
times
a
week
,
to
pay
their
duty
to
their
aunt
and
to
a
milliner’s
shop
ust
over
the
way
.
The
two
youngest
of
the
family
,
herine
and
Lydia
,
were
particularly
frequent
in
these
attentions
;
their
minds
were
more
vacant
than
their
sisters’
,
and
when
nothing
better
offered
,
a
walk
to
Meryton
was
necessary
to
amuse
their
morning
hours
and
furnish
conversation
for
the
evenin
;
and
however

At

neighbourhood

it

to
remain
the
whole

and
Meryton
was
the
head-quarters

Their
visits
to
Mrs
Philips
were
now
productive
of
the
most
interesting
intelligence
.
Every
day
added
something
to
their
knowledge
of
the
oﬂicers’
names
and
connections
.
Their
lodgings
were
not
long
a
secret
,
and
at
length
they
began
to
know
the
ofﬁcers
themselves
.
Mr
Philips
visited
them
all
,
and
this
opened
to
his
nieces
a
source
of
felicity
unknown

After
listening
one
morning
to
their
ell'usionl
on

subject
,
Mr

coolly
observed
—
“Frorn
all

Catherine
was
disconcened
,
and
made
no
answer
;
but
Lydia
,
with
perfect
indiﬂ'erence
,
continued
to
express
her
admiration
of

her
hope

seeing

he
was
going
the
next
morning
to

“
I

astonished

my

,

said
Mrs
Bennet
,
“that
you
should
be
so
ready
to
think
your
own
children
silly

If
I
wished
to

slightingly

it
should

I
must
hope

“Yea

“
This
is
the
only
point
,
I
ﬂatter
myself
,
on
which
we
do
not
agree
.
I
had
hoped
chit
our
sentiments
coincided
in
every
particular
,
but
I
must
to
far
dilI'er
from
you
as
to

youngest

:
uncommonly
foolish

“My
dear
Mr
Bennet
,
you
must
not
expect
such
girls
to
have
the
sense
of
their
father
and
mother
.
When
they
get
to
our
age
,
I
dare
say
they
will
not
think
about
oilicers
any
more
than
we
do

I

the
time
when
I
liked
a

myself

,

I
do
still
at

almost
incredible
to
Mn

;
and
Elizabeth
wan
convinced
that
they
held
her

contempt
for

.
She
was
received
,
however
,
very
politely
by
them
;
and
in
their

there
was
Iomething

The

was
divided
between
admiration
of
the
bn'lliancy
which
cxerciae
had
given
to
her
complexion
,
and
doubt
a.
to
the
occaeion’n
justifying
her
coming
to
far
alone
.
The
latter
was
thinking
only
of
his
breakfast
.
Her
inquiries
after
her
sister
were
not
very
favourably
anewered
.
Mist

had
Ilept
ill
,
and
though
up
,
wan
very
feverish
,
and
not
well
enough
to
leave
her

.
Elizabeth
was
glad
to
be
taken
to
her
immediately
;
and
Jane
,
who
had
only
been
withheld
by
the
fear
of
giving
alarm
or
inconvenience
from
expmning
in
her
note
how
much
the

at

She

and
when
Mina

left
them
together
,
could
attempt
little
beside
expressions
of
gratitude
for
the
extraordinary
kindness
the
was
treated
with
.
Elizabeth
silently
attended
her
.
When
breakfast
wan
over
they
were
joined
by
the

Elizabeth
began
to
like

herself
,
when
she

The

came
,
and
having
examined
his
patient
,
said
,
as
might
be
supposed
,
that
she
had
caught
a

,

that

get
the
better
of
it
;
advised
her
to
return
to
bed
,
and
promised
her
some
draughts
.
The
advice
was
followed
readily
,
for
the
feverish
symptoms
increased
,
and
her
head
ached
acutely
.
Elizabeth
did
not
quit
her
room
for
a
moment
,
nor
were
the
other
ladies
often
absent
:
the
entlcmen
being
out
,
they
had
,
in
fact
,
nothing
to
do
e
sewhere
.
When
the
clock
struck
three
,
Elizabeth
felt
that
the
must
go
,
and
very
unwillingly
said
so
.
Miss
Bingley
oﬂered
her

carriage
,
and
she

a
little
pressing

remain
at

for
the
present

Elizabeth
most
thankfirlly

,
and
a

to

Elizabeth
was
summoned
to

To
the
civil

then
poured
in
,

amongst

the

added
,
“if

for

“She

.
“Oh

Jane

It

what
everybody
says

But
,
however
,
he
did
not

Perhaps
he
thought
her
too
young
.
However
,
he
wrote
some
verses
on

they
were.”

”
“
I
have
been

to
consider

”

Darcy
.
“Of

the

her
carriage
.
Upon
this
signal
,
the
youngest
of
her
daughters
put
herself
forward
.
The
two
girls
had
been
whispering
to
each
other
during
the
whole
viit
,
and
the
result
of
it
was
,
that
the
youngest
should
tax
Mr
Bingley
with
having
promised
on
his
ﬁrst
coming
into
the
country
to
give
a
hall
at
Nether-ﬁeld
.
Lydia
was
:
stout
,
well-grown
girl
of
ﬁfteen
,
with
a
ﬁne
complexion
and
good-humoured
countenance
;
a
favourite
with
her
mother
,
whose
all‘ection
had
brought
her
into
public
at
an
early
age
.
She
had
high
animal
spirits
,
and
a
sort
of
natural
self-consequence
,
which
the
attentions
of
the
ofﬁcers
,
to
whom
her
uncle’s
good
dinners
and
her
own
easy
mnnerl
recommended
her
,
had
increased
into
assurance
.
She
was
very
us
]
,
therefore
,
to
address
Mr
Bingley
on
the
subject
0
the
ball
,
and
w
reminded
him
of
his
promise
;
adding
,
that
it
d
he
the
most
shameful
thing
in
the
world
if
he
did
not
keep
it
.
His
answer
to
this
sudden
amck
was
delightful
to
her
mother’s
r
—
“
I
am
perfectly
ready
,
I
assure
you
,
to
In
my

;
and
when

is
recovc
,

if
you
please
,
name

very
day
of
the
ball
.
gut
you
would
not
wish
to
be
dancin
while
she
is
ill.”
Lydia
declared
herself
anti
led
.
“Ohl
yes
—
it
would
be
much
better
to
wait
till
Jane
was
well
,
and
by
that
time
most
likely
Captain
Carter
would
be
at
Meryton
again
.
And
when
you
have
given
your
ball
,
”
she
added
,
“I
shall
insist
on
their
giving
one
also
.
shall
tell
Colonel
Forster
it
will
be
quite
a
shame
if
he
does
not.”
Mrs
Bennet
and
her
daughters
then
deported
,
and
Elizabeth
returned
instantly
to
Jane
,
leaving
her
own
and
her
relations’
behaviour
to
the
remarks
of
the
two
ladies
and
Mr
Darcy
;
the
latter
of
whom
,
however
,
could
not
be
prevailed
on
to
join
in
their
censure
of
her
,

consider
them
as
proceeding
from

,
which
,
If
not
estimable
,
you
think
at

highly
interesting
.
The
power
of
doing
anything
with
quickness
is
always
much
prized
by
the
r
,
and
often
without
an
attention
to
the
im
tioo
of
the
perfomtance
.
hen
you
told
Mrs

this
morning
,
that
if
you
ever
resolved
on
quitting

you
should
be
gone
in
ﬁve
minutes
,
you
mant
it
to
be
a
sort
of
panegyric
,
of
compliment
to
yourself
—
and
yet
what
is
there
so
very
laudable
in
a
precipitance
which
must
leave
very
necessary
business
undone
,
and
can
be
of
no
real
advantage
to
yourself
or
any
one
else
?
"
“Nay
,
”
cried
Bingley
,
“this
is
too
much
,
to
remember
at
night
all
the
foolish
things
that
were
said
in
the
morning
.
And
yet
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
believed
what
I
said
of
myself
to
be
true
,
and
I
believe
it
at
this
moment
.
At
least
,
therefore
,
I
did
not
assume
the
character
of
needless
precipitance
merely
to
show
at
?
before
the
ladies.”
“
I
dare
say
you
believed
it
;
but
I
am
by
no
means
convined
that
you
would
be
gone
with
such
celerity
.
Your
conduct
would
be
quite
as
dependent
on
chance
as
that
of
any
man
I
know
;
and
if
,
as
ou
were
mounting
your
horse
,
a
friend
were
to
say
,
‘

,
you
had
better
stay
till

,
’
you
would
probably
do
it
,
you
,
would
probably
not
go
—
and
at
another
word
,
might
stay
a
month.”
“You
have
only
proved
by
this
,
'
cried
Elizabeth
,
“that
Mr

did
not
do
justice
to
his

position
.
You
have
shown
him

now
much
more
than

did

“I
am
exceedingly
gratiﬁed
,

said
Bingley
,
“
by
your

sweetness
of

are
giving
it
a
turn
which
that
gentleman
did
by
no
means
intend
;
for
he
would
certainly
think
the
better
of
me
,
if
under
such
a
circumstance
I
were
to
give
a
ﬂat
denial
,
and
ride
oﬂ‘
as
fast
as
I
could.”
“Would
Mr
Darcy
then
consider
the
rashness
of
your
original
intention
as
awned
for
by
your
obstinacy
m
adhering
to
it
?
”
"
Upon
my
word
,
I
can
not
exactly
explain
the
matter
;
Darcy
must
speak
for
himself.”
“
You
ex
t
me
to
account
for
opinions
which
you
chuse
to
cal
mine
,
but
which
I
have
never
acknowledged
.
Allowing
the
case
,
however
,
to
stand
according
to
your
represenmtion
,
you
must
remember
,
Miss
Bennct
,
that
the
friend
who
is
supposed
to
desire
his
return
to
the
house
,
and
the
dela
of
his
plan
,
has
merely
desired
it
,
asked
it
without
0
ering
one
argument
in
favour
of
its
propriety.”
“To
yield
readily
—
easil’y
—
w
the
perman
m
of
a
friend
is
no
merit
with
you.’
“
T
n
yield
without
conviction
is
no
compliment
to
the
understanding
of
either.”
“
You
appear
to
me
,
Mr
Darcy
,
to
allow
nothing
for
the
inﬂuence
of
friendship
and
affection
.
A
regard
for
the
requester
would
often
make
one
readily
yield
to
a
request
,
without
waiting
for
arguments
to
reason
one
into
it
.
I
am
not
particularl
speakin
of
such
a
case
as
on
have
supposed
about
r
Bing
ey
.
We
may
as
weil
wait
,
perhaps
,
till
the
circumstance
occurs
before
we
discuss
the
discretion
of
his
behaviour
thereupon
.
But
in
general
and
ordinary
cases
between
friend
and
friend
,
where
one
of
them
is
desired
by
the
other
to
change
a
resolution
of
no
very
great
moment
,
should
you
think
ill
of
that
person
for
complying
with
the
desire
,
without
waiting
to
he
argued
into
it
?
”
“Will
it
not
be
advisable
,
before
we
proceed
on
this
subject
,
to
arrange
with
rather
more
precision
the
degree
5°
PRIDE
AND
PREJ'UDICE
.
of
importance
which
is
so
sppenain
to
this
net
,
as
well
this
as
the
degree
of
intimacy
ubsisting
ween
the
parties
.’
”
“
By
all
means
,
”
cried
Bingley
;
“let
us
hear
all
the
particulars
,
not
forgetting
their
comparative
height
and
size
;
for
that
will
have
more
weight
in
the
argument
,
Miss
Bennet
,
than
you
may
be
aware
of
.
I
assure
you
,
that
if
Darcy
were
not
such
a
great
tall
fellow
,
in
comparison
with
myself
,
I
should
not
pay
him
half
so
much
deference
.
I
declare
I
do
not
know
a
more
awful
object
than
Darcy
,
on
particular
occasions
,
and
in
particular
places
;
at
his
own
house
especially
,
and
of
a
Sunday
evening
,
when
he
has
nothing
to
do.”
Mr
Darcy
smiled
;
but
Elimbeth
thought
she
could
perceive
that
he
was
rather
offended
,
and
therefore
checked
her
laugh
.
Miss
Bingley
warmly
resented
the
indignity
he
had
received
,
in
an
cxpostulatiou
with
her
brother
for
talking
such
nonsense
.
“
I
see
your
design
,
Bingley
,
'
said
his
friend
.
—
“
You
dislike
an
argument
,
and
want
to
silence
this
.
'
“
Perhaps
I
do
.
Arguments
are
too
much
like
disputes
.
If
you
and
Miss
Bennet
will
defer
yours
till
I
am
out
of
the
room
,
I
shall
be
very
thankful
;
and
then
you
may
say
whatever
you
like
of
me.”
“
What
you
ask
,
'
said
Elizabeth
,
“is
no
sacriﬁce
on
my
side
;
and
Mr
Darcy
had
much
better
ﬁnidi
his
letter.”
Mr
Darcy
took
her
advice
,
and
did
ﬁnish
his
letter
.
When
that
business
was
over
,
he
applied
to
Miss
Bingley
and
Elizabeth
for
the
indulgence
of
some
music
.
Miss
Bingley
moved
with
alacrity
to
the
piano-forte
;
and
,
after
a
polite
request
that
Elizabeth
would
lad
the
way
,
which
the
other
as
litely
and
more
earnestly
negatived
,
she
ted
herself
.

0
Mrs
Hurst
sang

:
her
sister
,
and
while
they
were
thus
employed
,
Elizabeth
could
not
help
observing
,
as
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.
5
!
she
turned
over
some
music-books
that
lay
on
the
instrument
,
how
fre
uently
Mr
Darcy’s
eyes
were
ﬁxed
on
her
.
She
ha
y
knew
how
to
suppose
that
she
could
be
an
object
of
admiration
to
no
great
a
man
;
and
yet
that
he
should
look
at
her
because
he
disliked
her
,
was
still
more
strange
.
She
could
only
imagine
however
at
last
,
that
she
drew
his
notice
because
there
wax
is
something
about
her
more
wrong
and
reprehensible
,
according
to
his
ideas
of
right
,
than
in
any
other
rson
present
.
The
supposition
did
not
pain
her
.
She
iked
him
too
little
lo
care
for
his
approbation
.
After
playing
some
Italian
songs
,
Miss
Bingley
varied
the
charm
by
a
liVely
Scoteh
air
;
and
soon
afterwards
Mr
Darcy
,
drawing
near
Elizabeth
,
aid
to
her
—
“Do
not
you
feel
a
great
inclination
,
Miss
Bennet
,
to
seize
such
an
opportunity
of
dancing
a
reel
?
"
She
smiled
,
but
made
no
answer
.
He
repeated
the
uestion
,
with
some
su
rize
at
her
silence
.
"
0h
!
”
said
she
,
“
heard
you
before
,
but
I
could
not
immediately
determine
what
to
lay
in
reply
.
You
wanted
me
,
I
know
,
to
say
‘
Yes
,
’
that
on
might
have
the
pleasure
of
dcspising
my
taste
;
but
always
delight
in
overthrowing
those
kind
of
schemes
,
and
cheating
a
n
of
their
premeditated
contempt
.
I
have
,
thereore
,
made
up
my
mind
to
tell
you
,
that
I
do
not
want
to
dance
a
reel
at
all
—
and
now
despise
me
if
you
dare.”
“
Indeed
I
do
not
dare.”
Elizabeth
,
having
rather
expected
to
aﬁront
him
,
was
amazed
at
his
gallantry
;
but
there
was
a
mixture
of
sweetness
and
archness
in
her
manner
which
made
it
dillicnlt
{
or
her
to
aﬂ'ront
anybody
;
and
Darcy
had
never
been
so
bewitched
by
any
woman
as
he
was
by
her
.
He
really
believed
,
that
were
it
not
for
the
inferiority
of
her
connections
,
he
should
be
in
some
danger.

Then
taking
the

of
Mr

,
she
leﬁ
Elizabeth
to
walk
by
herself
.
The
path
admitted
three
.
Mr

felt
their
mdenesl
,
and
immediatdy
said
—
“
This
walk
is
not
wide
enough
for

party
.
We
had
better
go
into

avenue.”
But
Elizabeth
,
who
had
not
the
least
inclination
to
remain
with
them
,

answered
—
“
No

She
then
ran

rejoicing
,
as
she
rambled
about
,
in
the
hope
of
being
at
home
again
in

Jane
was
already
so
much
recovered
as
to
intend
leaving
her
room
for
a
couple
of
hours
that
evening

HEN
the
ladies
removed
after
dinner
,
Elinbeth
ran
up
to
her
sister
,
and
seeing
her
well
guarded
from
cold
,
attended
her
into
the
drawing-room
,
where
she
was
welcomed
by
her
two
friends
with
many
professions
of
pleasure
;
and
Elilabeth
had
never
seen
them
so
agreeable
as
they
were
during
the
hour
which
passed
before
the
gentlemen
appeared
.
Their
powers
of
conversation
were
considerable
.
They
could
describe
an
entertainment
with
accuracy
,
relate
an
anecdote
with
humour
,
and
lau
h
at
their
acquaintance
with
spirit
.
ut
when
the
gentlemen
entered
,
Jane
was
no
longer
the
ﬁrst
object
;
Miss
Bingley’s
eyes
were
instantly
turned
towards
Darcy
,
and
she
had
something
to
say
to
him
before
he
had
advanced
many

steps
.
He
addressed
,
himself
directlylto
Mill
Bennet
,
with
a
polite
congratulation
;
Mr
um
also
made
her
a
slight
bow
,
and
said
he
was
“
very
glad
,
”
but
dilliiseness
and
warmth
remained
for
Bingley’s
salutation
.
He
was
full
of
oy
and
attention
.
The
ﬁrst
half-hour
was
spent
in
piling
up
the
ﬁre
,
lest
she
should
suffer
from
the
change
of
room
;
and
she
removed
at
his
desire
to
the
other
side
of
the
ﬁreplace
,
that
she
might
be
further
from
the
door
.
He
then
r.
down
by
her
,
and
talked
scarcely
to
any
one
else
.
Elizabeth
,
at
work
in
the
opposite
comer
,
w
it
all
with
great
delight
.
When
tea
was
over
,
Mr
Hum
reminded
his
sisterin-law
of
the
card-table
—
but
in
vain
.
She
had
obtained
private
intelligence
that
Mr
Darcy
did
not
wish
for
cards
;
and
Mr
Hurst
soon
found
even
his
open
petition
rejected
.
She
assured
him
that
no
one
intended
to
play
,
and
the
silence
of
the
whole
party
on
the
subject
seemed
to
justify
her
.
Mr
Hurst
had
therefore
nathing
to
do
,
but
to
stretch
himself
on
one
of
the
sophas
and
go
to
sleep
.
Darcy
took
up
a
book
;
Miss
Bingley
did
the
same
;
and
Mrs
Hurst
,
principally
occupied
in
playing
with
her
bracelets
and
rings
,
joined
now
and
then
in
her
brother’s
conversation
with
Miss
Bennet
.
Miss

,
as
in
reading
her
own
;
and
she
was
perpetually
either
making
some
inquiry
,
or
looking
at
his
page
.
She
could
not
win
him
,
however
,
to
any
conversation
;
he
merely
answered
her
question
,
and
read
on
.
At
length
,
quite
exhausted
by
the
attempt
to
be
amused
with
her
own
book
,
which
she
had
only
chosen
because
it
was
the
second
volume
of
his
,
she
gave
a
great
yawn
and
said
,
“
How
pleasant
it
is
to
spend

in

way
!
I
declare

all
there
is

How

of

—
When
I
have
a
house
of
my
own
,
I
shall
be
miserable
if
I
have
not
an
excellent
library.”
No
one
made
any
reply
.
She
then
yawned
again
,
threw
aside
her
book
,
and
cast
her
eyes
round
the
room
in
quest
.
of
some
amusement
;
when
hearing
her
brother
mentioning
a
ball
to
Miss
Bennet
,
she
turned
suddenly
towards
him
and
said
—
"
By
the
bye
,
Charles
,
are
you
really
serious
in
meditating
a
dance
at
Netherlield
?
—
I
would
advise
you
,
before
you
determine
on
it
,
to
consult
the
wishes
of
the
present
party
;
I
am
much
mistaken
if
there
are
not
some
among
us
to
whom
a
ball
would
be
rather
a
punishment
than
a
leasure
.
'
"
If
you
mean

cried
her
brother
,
“he
may
go
to

,
if
he
chuses
,
before
it
begins

as
for
the
ball
,
it
is
quite
a
settled
thing
;
and
as
soon
as
Nicholls
has
made
while
soup
enough
,
I
shall
send
round
my
cards.”
“I
should
like
balls
inﬁnitely
better
,
”
she
replied
,
“if
they
were
carried
on
in
a
different
manner
;
but
there
is
something
insulfcmbl
tedious
in
the
usual
process
of
such
a
meeting
.
{
t
would
surely
be
much
more
rational
if
conversation
instead
of
dancing
made
the
order
of
the
day.”
“
Much
more
rational
,
my
dear
Caroline
,
I
dare
ﬂy
,
but
it
would
not
be
near
so
much
like
a
ball
.
'
Miss
Bingley
made
no
answer
,
and
soon
afterwards
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
.
Her
ﬁgure
was
elegant
,
and
she
walked
well
;
—
—
-but
Darcy
,
at
whom
it
was
all
aimed
,
was
still
inﬂexibly
studious
.
In
the
desperation
of
her
feelings
,
she
resolved
on
one
effort
more
,
and
,
turning
to
Elizabeth
,
said
—
“
Miss
Eliza
Bennet
,
let
me
persuade
you
to
follow
my
example
,
and
take
a
turn
about
the
room

you
it
is
very
refreshing
after
sitting
so
long
in
one
attitude.”
Eliubeth
was
surprised
,
but
agreed
to
it
immediately
.
Miss
Binglcy
succeeded
no
less
in
the
real
object
of
her
civility
;
Mr
Darcy
looked
up
.
He
was
as
much
awake
to
the
novelt
of
attention
in
that
quarter
as
Elizabeth
herself
coﬂ’d
be
,
and
unconsciously
closed
his
book
.
He
was
directly
invited
to
join
their
party
,
but
he
declined
it
,
observing
,
that
he
could
imagine
but
two
motives
for
their
chusing
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
together
,
with
either
of
which
motives
his
joining
them
would
interfere
.
“What
could
he
mean
?
she
was
dying
to
know
what
could
be
his
meaning
"
—
and
asked
Elizabeth
whether
she
could
at
all
understand
him
?
“Not
at
all
,
”
was
her
answer
;
“but
depend
upon
it
.
he
means
to
be
severe
on
us
,
and
our
surest
way
of
disappointing
him
will
be
to
ask
nothing
about
it
.
'
Miss
Bingley
,
however
,
was
incapable
of
dip
inting
Mr
Darcy
in
anything
,
and
persevered
there
ore
in
requiring
an
explanation
of
his
two
motives
.
“I
have
not
the
smallest
ob‘cction
to
explaining
them
,
”
said
he
,
as
soon
as
she
a
lowed
him
to
speak
.
“You
either
chuse
this
method
of
passing
the
evening
because
you
are
in
each
other
s
conﬁdence
,
and
have
secret
affairs
to
discuss
,
or
because
you
are
conscious
that
your
ﬁgures
appear
to
the
greatest
advantage
in
walking
;
—
if
the
ﬁrst
,
I
should
be
completely
in

way
,
and
if

,
I
can
admire
you
much
better

“Oh
!

!

Miss
Bingley
.
“I
never
heard

a

"
Nothing

“
Mr

cried
Elizabeth
.
“That
is
an
uncommon
advantage
,
and

,

would

away
to
hide
a
smile

"
I
am
perfectly
convinced
by
it
that
Mr

no

He
owns

“No”

Darcy

.
N
consequence
of
an
agreement
between
the
listen
,
Elizabeth
wrote
the
next
morning
to
her
mother
,
to
beg
that
the
carriage
mi
ht
be
sent
for
them
in
the
course
of
the
day
.
But
[
fl/
[
rs
Bennet
,
who
had
calculated
on
her
daughters
remaining
at
Netherﬁeld
till
the
following
Tnesda
,
which
would
exactly
ﬁnish
Jane’s
week
,
could
not
ring
herself
to
receive
them
with
pleasure
before
.
Her
answer
,
therefore
,
was
not
propitious
,
at
least
not
to
Elizabeth’s
wishes
,
for
she
was
impatient
to
get
home
.
Mrs
Bennet
sent
them
word
that
they
could
not
possibly
have
the
carriage
before
Tuesday
;
and
in
her
postscript
it
was
added
,
that
if
Mr
Bingley
and
his
sister
pressed
them
to
stay
longer
,
she
could
spare
them
very
well
.
A
inst
staying
longer
,
however
,
Elizabeth
was
sitive‘l
;
l
resolved
—
nor
did
the
much
expect
it
wou
d
be
asked
;
and
fearful
,
on
the
contrary
,
It
being
considered
as
intruding
themselves
needlessly
long
,
she
urged
Jane
to
borrow
Mr
Binglcy’s
carriage
immediately
,
and
it
was
at
length
settled
that
their
original
design
of
leaving
Netherﬁeld
that
morning
should
be
mentioned
,
and
the
re
nest
made
.
“The
communication
excited
many
professions
of
concern
;
and
enou
h
was
said
of
wishing
them
to
stay
at
least
till
the
fa
lowing
day
to
work
on
Jane
;
and
till
the
marrow
their
going
was
deferred
.
Miss
Bingley
was
then
sorry
that
she
had
proposed
the
delay
,
for
her
jealousy
and
dislike
of
one
sister
much
exceeded
her
affection
for
the
other
.
The
master
of
the
house
heard
with
real
sorrow
that
they
were
to
go
so
soon
,
and
repeatedly
tried
to
persuade
Miss
Bennet
that
it
would
not
be
safe
for
her
—
that
she
was
not
enough
recovered
;

was

herself

After
musing
himself
some

he
thus
explained

I
do
think
it
is
the
hardest
thing
in
the
world
,
that
your
estate
should
be
entailed
away
from
your
own
children
;

I
am
sure
,
if
I

I

or
other
about

.
Jane
and
Elizabeth
attempted
to
explain
to
her
the
nature
of
an
entail
.
They
had
often
attempted
it
before
,
but
it
was
a
subject
on
which
Mn
Bennet
was
beyond
the
reach
of
reason
,
and
the
continued
to
rail
bitterly
against
the
cruelty
of
settling
an
estate
away
from
a
family
of
live
daughters
,
in
favour
of
a
man
whom
nobody
cared
anything
about
.
“
It
certainly
is
a
most
iniquitous
aﬂ'air
,
”
said
Mr
Bennet
,
“and
nothing
can
clear
Mr
Collins
from
the
guilt
of
inheriting
Longboum
.
But
if
you
will
listen
to
his
lever
,
you
may
perhaps
be
a
little
softened
by
his
manner
of
expressing
himself.”
“No

The
disagreement
subsisting
between
yourself
and
my
late
honoured
father
always
gave
me
much
uneasiness
,
and
since
I
have
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
him
,
I
have
frequently
wished
to
heal
the
breach
;
but
for
some
time
I
was
kept
back
by
my
own
doubts
,
fearing
lest
it
might
seem
disrespectful
to
his
memory
for
me
to
be
on
good
terms
with
any
one
with
whom
it
had
always
pleased
him
to
be
at
variance
.
—
“
There

Mrs

—
My
mind
,
however
,
is
now
made
up
on
the
subject
,
for
having
received
ordination
at
Easter
,
I
have
been
so
fortunate
as
to
be
distinguished
by
the
atronage
of
the
Right
Honourable
Lady
Catherine
de

,
widow
of
Sir
Louis
de
Bourgh
,
whose
bounty
and
beneﬁcence
has
preferred
me
to
the
valuable
rectory
of
this
parish
,
where
it
shall
be
my
earnest
endeavour
to
demean
myself
with
grateful
respect
towards
her
Ladyship
,
and
be
ever
ready
to
form
those
rites
and
ceremonies
which
are
institu

the
Church
of

As

I

it
my
dut
to
promote
and
establish
the
blessing
of
peace
in

within
the
reach
of
my
inﬂuence
;
and
on
these
grounds
I
ﬂatter
myself
that
my

overtures
of
good-will
are
highly
commendable
,
and
that
the
circumstance
of
my
being

up

He

upon

if

Catherine
and
Lydia
,
neither
the

'
It
was
next
to
impossible
that
their
cousin
shoul
come
in
a
scarlet
coat
,
and
it
was
now
some
weeks
since
they
had
received
pleasure
from
the
society
of
a
man
in
any
other
colour
.
As
for
their
mother
,
Mr
Collins’a
letter
had
done
away
much
of
her
ill-will
,
and
she
was
preparing
to
see
him
with
I
degree
of
composure
which
atonished
her
husband
and
daughters
.
Mr
Collins
was
punctual
to
his
time
,
and
was
received
with
great
politeness
by
the
whole
family
.
Mr
Bennet
indeed
said
little
;
but
the
ladies
were
ready
enough
to
talk
,
and
Mr
Collins
seemed
neither
in
need
of
encouragement
,
nor
inclined
to
be
silent
himself
.
He
was
a
nil
,
heavy-looking
young
man
of
live-and-twenty
.
His
air
was
grave
and
stately
,
and
his
manners
were
very
formal
.
He
had
not
been
long
seated
before
he
complimented
Mrs
Bennet
on
having
so
ﬁne
a
family
of
daughters
;
said
he
had
heard
much
of
their
beauty
,
but
that
in
this
instance
fame
had
fallen
shon‘
.
of
the
truth
;
and
added
,
that
he
did
not
doubt
her
seeing
them
all
in
due
time
well
disposed
of
in
marriage
.
This
gallantry
was
not
much
to
the
taste
of
some
of
his
hearers
;
but
Mrs
Bennet
,
who
quarrelled
with
no
compliments
,
answered
most
readily
.
“
You
are
very
kind
,
I
am
sure
;
and
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
it
may
prove

He
was
interrupted
by
a
summons
to
dinner
;
and
the
girls
smiled
on
each
other
.
They
were
not
the
only
objects
of
Mr
Collins’e
admiration
.
The
hall
,
the
dining-room
,
and
all
its
furniture
,
were
examined
and
priced
;

his

of

and
consideration
for

,
appeared
very
remarkable
.
Mr
Bennet
could
not
have
chosen
better
.
Mr
Collins
was
eloquent
in
her
praise
.
The
subject
elevated
him
to
more
than

solemnity
of
manner
,

with
a
most

he

that

such
behaviour
in
a

of

—
such
all'ability

condescension

as
he
had
himself
experienced
from
Lady

She
had
been
graciously

to

of
both
the

also

twice

had

not

to

Mr
Bennet’s
expectations
were
fully
answered
.
His
cousin
was
as
absurd
as
he
had
hoped
,
and
he
listened
to
him
with
the
keenest
enjoyment
,
maintaining
at
the
same
time
the
most
resolute
composure
of
countenance
,

however
,
the
dose
had
been
enough
,
and
Mr

was
glad
to
take
his
guest
into

drawingroom
again
,
and
,
when
tea
was
over
,
glad
to
invite
him
to
read
aloud
to
the
ladies
.
Mr
Collins
readily
assented
,
and
a
book
was
produced
;
but
on
beholding
it
(
for
everything
announced
it
to
he
fmm
a

library
)
,
he
started
back
,
and
begging
pardon
,
protested
that
he
never
read
novels
.
Kitty
stared
at
him
,
and
Lydia
exclaimed
—
Other
books

produced
,
and
after
some
deliberation
he
chose
Fordyce’s

Lydia
gaped
as
he
opened
the
volume
,
and
before
he
had

with
very
monotonous
solemnity
,
read
three
pages
,
she
interrupted
him
with

could

was
now
high
in
her
good
graces
.
Lydia
s
intention
of
walking
to
Meryton
was
not
forgotten
;
every
sister
except
Mary
agreed
to
go
with
her
;
and
Mr
Collins
was
to
attend
them
,
at
the
request
of
Mr
Bennet
,
who
was
most
anxious
to
get
rid
of
him
,
and
have
his
library
to
himself
;
for
thither
Mr
Collins
had
followed
him
after
breakfast
,
and
there
he
would
continue
,
nominally
engaged
with
one
of
the
largest
folios
in
the
collection
,
but
really
talking
to
Mr
Bennet
,
with
little
cessation
,
of
his
house
and
garden
at
Huntford
.
Such
doings
discomposed
Mr
Bennet
exceedingly
.
In
his
library
he
had
been
always
sure
of
leisure
and
tranquillity
;
and
though
prepared
,
as
he
told
Elizabeth
,
to
meet
with
folly
and
conceit
in
every
other
room
in
the
house
,
he
was
used
to
be
free
from
them
there
;
his
civility
,
therefore
,
was
most
prompt
in
inviting
Mr
Collins
to
join
his
daughters
in
their
walk
;
and
Mr
Collins
,
being
in
fact
much
better
ﬁtted
for
a
walker
than
a
reader
,
was
extremely
well
pleased
to
close
his
large
book
,
and
go
.
In
pomPous
nothings
on
his
side
,
and
civil
assents
on
that
of
his
cousins
,
their
time
passed
till
they
entered
Merymn
.
The
attention
of
the
younger
ones
was
then
no
longer
to
be
gained
by
Lin
.
Their
eyes
were
immediately
wandering

In
the
street
in
quest
of
the
olﬁcers
,
and
nothing
can
than
a
very
smart
bonnet

,
or
a
really
new
muslin
in
a
shop
window
,
could
recall
them
.
But
the
attention
of
every
lady
was
soon
caught
by
a
young
man
,
whom
they
had
never
seen
before
,
of
most
gentlemanlike
2p
earance
,
walking
with
an
oﬁicer

aving
now
a
good

and
very
sufﬁcient

,
he
intended
to

;
and
in
seeking
a
reconciliation
with
the
Longbourn
Ilidmily
he
had
a
wife
in
view
,
aa
he
meant
to
chuae
one
of
the
daughters
,
if
he
found
them
as
handsome
and
amiable
as
they
were
represented
by
common
report
.
This
was
his
plan
of
amends
—
of
atonement
—
for
inheriting
their
father’s
estate
;
and
he
thought
it
an
excellent
one
,
full
of
eligibility
and
mitahlencss
,
and
exceuively
generous
and
disinterested
on
his
own
Part

His
lan
did
not

them

Miss

conﬁrmed

strictest
notions
of
what
was
due
to

;
and
for
the
first

was
his
settled
choice
.
The

,
however
,

an
alteration

a
conversation
beginning
with
his
parsonage-house
,
and
leading
naturally
to
the
avowal
of
his
hopes
,
that
a
mistress
for
it
might
be
found
at
Longboum
,
produced
from
her
,
amid
very
complainant
smich
and
general
encoumgcment

a
caution
against
the
very

had
ﬁxed
on
.
“

only
to

from

were

with

the

the
street
,
under
pretence

wanting
something
in

,
and
fortunatel
had
just
gained
the
pavement
when
the
two
gentlyemen
,
turning
back
,
had
reached
the
same
spot
.
Mr
Denny
addressed
them
directl
,
and
entreated
permission
to
introduce
his
friend
,
Nir
Wickham
,
who
had
returned
with
him
the
day
before
from
town
,
and
he
was
happy
to
say
had
accepted
a
commission
in
their
corps
.
This
was
exactly
as
it
should
be
;
for
the
young
man
wanted
only
regimentals
to
make
him
completely
charming
.
His
appearance
was
greatly
in
his
favour
;
he
had
all
the
best
part
of
beauty
,
3
ﬁne
countenance
,
a
good
ﬁgure
,
and
very
pleasing
address
.
The
introduction
was
followed
up
on
his
side
by
a
happy
readiness
of
conversan'ou
—
a
readiness
at
the
same
time
perfectly
correct
and
unassuming
;
and
the
whole
party
were
still
standing
and
talking
together
very
agreeably
,
when
the
sound
of
horses
drew
their
notice
,
and
Darcy
and
Bingley
were
seen
riding
down
the
street
.
On
distinguishing
the
ladies
of
the
group
,
the
two
gentlemen
came
directly
towards
them
,
and
began
the
usual
civilities
.
Bingley
was
the
principal
spokesman
,
and
Miss
Bennet
the
principal
object
.
He
was
then
,
he
said
,
on
his
way
to
Longbourn
on
purpose
to
inquire
after
her
.
Mr
Darcy
corroborated
it
with
a
bow
,
and
was
beginning
to
determine
not
to
ﬁx
his
eyes
on
Elizabeth
,
when
they
were
suddenly
arrested
by
the
sight
of
the
stranger
,
and
Elizabeth
happening
to
see
the
countenance
of
both
as
they
looked
at
each
other
,
was
all
astonishment
at
the
effect
of
the
meeu'ng
.
Both
changed
colour
,
one
looked
white
,
the
other
red
.
Mr
Wickham

after
a
few
moments

touched

ﬁr
Bingley
,
but
without
seeming
to
have
noticed
what
passed
,
took
leave
and
rode
on
with
his
friend
.
Mr
Denny
and
Mr
Wickham
walked
with
the
young
ladies
to
the
door
of
Mr
Philips’s
house
,
and
then
made
their
bows
,
in
spite
of
Miss
Lydia
s

entraties
that
they
would

in
,
and
even
in

up

was
always
glad
to
see
her
nieces
;
and
the
two
eldest
,
from
their
recent
absence
,
were
particularly
welcome
,
and
she
was
eagerly
expressing
her
surprize
at
their
sudden
return
home
,
which
,
as
their
own
can'iage
had
not
fetched
them
,
she
should
have
known
nothing
about

if
she
had
not

to

She
received

with

very

,
which
he
returned
with
as

more
,
apologizing
for
his
intrusion
,
without
any
previous
acquaintance

,

he
could
not

ﬂattering
himself
,
however
,
might
be
justiﬁed
by
his
relationship
to
the
young
ladies
who
introduced
him
to
her
notice
.
Mrs

was
quite
awed
by
such
an
excess
of
good
breeding
;
but
her
contem
lation
of
one
stranger
was
soon
put
an
end
to
by
exc
mations
and
inquiries
about
the
other
;
of
whom
,
however
,
she
could
only
tell
her
niecel
what
they
already
knew
,
that
Mr
Denny
had
brought
him
from
London
,
and
that
he
was
to
have
a
lieutenant’s
commission
in

appeared
,
Kitty

would
certainly
have
continued
the

unluckin
no

passed
the

now
except
a
few
of
the
ofﬁcers
,
who
,
in
comparison
with
the
manger
,
were
become
“
stupid
,
disagreeable
fellows.”
Some
of
them
were
to
dine
with
the
Philipses
the
next
day
,
and
their
aunt
promised
to
make
her
husband
call
on
Mr
Wickham
,
and
give
him
an
invitation
also
,
if
the
family
from
Longboum
would
come
in
the
evening
.
This
was
agreed
to
,
and
Mrs
Philips
protested
that
they
would
have
a
nice
cornfortable
noisy
game
of
lottery
tickets
,
and
a
little
bit
of

supper
afterwards
.
The
prospect
of
such

was
very
cheering
.
and
the
parted

Mr
Collins
repeate
his
apologies
in
quitting

,
and
was
assured
with
unwearyiog
civility
that
they
were
rfectly

related
to

but

have
defended
either
or
both
,
had
they
appeared
to
be

,
she
could
no
more
ex

such
behaviour
than
her
sister
.
r
Collins
on
his
return
highly
gratiﬁed
Mrs
Bennet
by
admiring
Mrs
Philips’s
manners
and
politeness
.
He
protested
that
,
except
Lady
Catherine
and
her
daughter
,
he
had
never
seen
a
more
elegant
woman
;
for
she
had
not

received
him
with
the

but
had
even
pointedly
included
him
in
her
invitation
for
the
next

,
although
utterly
unknown
to
her
before
.
Something
,
he
supposed
,
might
be
attributed
to

he

never

,
with

were
in

a
Very

,

set
,
and
the
best
of
them
were
of

party
;

Mr

was
as

beyond
them
all
in
person

,
as

were
superior
to
the

,
stuffy
uncle

,
breathing

,
who
followed
them
into

room

Mr
Wickham
was
the
happy
man
towards
whom
almost
every
female
eye
was
turned
,
and
Elizabeth
was
the
happy
woman
by
whom
he
ﬁnally
seated

;
and
the
agreeable
manner
in
which
he
immediately
fell
into
conversation
,
though
it
was
only
on
its
being
a
wet
night
,
and
on
the
probability
of
a
rainy
season
,
made
her
feel
that
the
commonest
,
dullest
,
most
threadbare
topic
might
be
rendered
interesting
by
the
skill
of
the
speaker
.
With
such
rivals
for
the
notice
of
the
fair
as
Mr
Wickham
and
the
oﬂicers
,
Mr
Collins
seemed
to
sink
into
insignilicance
;
to
the
young
ladies
he
certainly
was
nothing
;
but
he
had
still
at
intervals
a
kind
listener
in
Mrs
Philips
,
and
was
,
by
her
watchfulness
,
most
abundantly
supplied
with
coffee
and
mufﬁn
.
When
the
card-tables
were
placed
,
he
had
an
opportunity
of
obliging
her
in
return
,
by
sitting
down
to

.
“I

Mrs

was
very

for
his

could
not

it

is
blinded
by

sees

“

shook

said
he
,
at
the
next
opportunity
of
speaking
,
“whether

the

of

There
was
just
such
an
infonmlity
in
the
terms
of
the
bequest
as
to
give
me
no
hope
from
law
.
A
man
of
honour
could
not
have
doubted
the
intention
,

Mr

chose
to
doubt
it
—
or
to
treat
it
as
a
merely
conditional
recommendation
,

to
assert
that
I
had
forfeited

it

extravagance

imlmrdence
—
in

anything
or
nothing

that
the

became
vacant
two
years

exactly
as
I
was

an
age
to
hold
it
,

that
it
was
given
to
another
man
;

no

certain
is
it
,
that
I
urnnot

myself
of

the

'
Mr
Wickham’s
attention
was
caught
;
and
after
observing
Mr
Collins
for
a
few
moments
,
he
asked
Elizabeth
in
a
low
voice
whether
her
relation
were
very
intimately
acquainted
with
the
family
of
de
Bourgh
.
"
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
,
'
she
replied
,
“has
very
lately
given
him
a
living
.
I
hardly
know
how
Mr
Collins
was
ﬁrst
introduced
to
her
notice
,
but
he
certainly
has
not
known
her
long.”
“You
know
of
course
that
Lady
Catherine
de

and
Lady
Anne
Darcy

sisters
;
consequent
]
that
she
is

the
recent
Mr

,
indeed
,

nothing

of

I
never

before
yesterday
.
'
“
Her
daughter
,
Miss
de

,
will
have
a
very
large
fortune
,
and
it
is
believed
that
she
and
her
cousin
will
unite
the
two
estates
.
'
This
information
made
Elizabeth
smile
,
as
she
thought
of
poor
Mina
Bingley
.
Vain
indeed
must
be
all
her
attentions
,
vain
and
useless
her
alfection
for
his
sister
and
her
praise
of
himself
,
if
he
were
already
selfdestined
to
another
.
“Mr
Collins
,
'
said
she
,
“speaks
highly
both
or
Lady
Catherine
and
her
daughter
;
but
from
some
particulare
that

has
related

I
suspect
his

that

is

“
I
believe
her
to
be

Wickharn
;

Elizabeth

that
he

rational
account
of
it
,

the
continued
talking
together
with

satisfaction
rapper
put

could

of

of

of

LIZABETH
related
to
Jane
the
next
day
what
had
awed
between
Mr
Wickhnm
and
herself
.
Jane
iatened
with
astonishment
and
concern
;
—
—
she
knew
not
how
to
believe
that
Mr
Darcy
could
be
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
87
so
unworthy
of
Mr
Bingley
s
regard
;
and
yet
,
it
was
not
in
her
nature
to
question
the
veracity
of
a
young
man
of
such
amiable
appearance
as
Wicldram
.
The
possibility
of
his
having
really
endured
such
unkindness
,
was
enough
to
interest
all
her
tender
feelings
;
and
nothing
therefore
remained
to
[
be
]
done
,
but
to
think
well
0
them
both
,
to
defend
the
conduct
of
each
,
and
throw
into
the
account
of
accident
or
mistake
whatever
could
not
be
otherwise
explained
.
“They
have
both
,
”
said
she
,
“
been
deceived
,
I
dare
say
,
in
some
way
or
other
,
of
which
we
can
form
no
idea
.

the
causes
or
circumstances
which
may
have
alienated
them
,
without
actual
blame
on
either
side.”
“
Very
true
,
indeed
;
—
—
and
now
,
my
dear
Jane
,
what
have
you
got
to
say
in
behalf
of
the
interested
people
who
have
robably
been
concerned
in
the
business
2
—
Do
dear
I
as
too
,
or
we
shall
be
obliged
to
think
ill
of
somebody.”
“Laugh
as
much
as
you
chusc
,
but
you
will
not
laugh
me
out
of
my
opinion
.
M
dearest
Lizzy
,
do
but
consider
in
what
a
disgracefu
light
it
places
Mr
Darcy
,
to
be
treating
his
father’s
favourite
in
such
a
manner
,
—
one
,
whom
his
father
had
promised
to
provide
for
.
It
is
impossible
.
No
man
of
common
humanity
,
no
man
who
had
any
value
for
his
character
,
could
be
capable'of
it
.
Can
his
most
intimate
friends
he
so
excessively
deceived
in
him
i
—
ohl
no.”
“I
can
much
more
easily
believe
Mr
Bingley’s
being
imposed
on
,
than
that
Mr
Wickham
should
invent
such
a
history
of
himself
as
he
gave
me
last
night
;
names
,
facts
,
everything
mentioned
without
ceremony
.
If
it
be
not
so
,
let
Mr
Darcy
contradict
it
.
Besides
,
there
was
truth
in
his
looks.”

But
Jane
could
think
with
certainty
on
only
one
point
—
that
Mr
Bingley
,
if
he
bad
ken
on
,
would
have
much
to
euﬂ‘er
when
the
aﬁair
became
public
.
The
two
young
ladies
were
Iummoned
from
the
Ihrubbery
,
where
this
convemtion
pasted
,
by
the
arrival
of
some
of
the
very
persona
of
whom
they
had
been
speaking
:
Mr
Bingley
and
hiIieten
came
to
give
their
peraonal
invitation
for
the
long-ex
hall
at
Netherﬁeld
,
which
was
ﬁxed
for
the
fol
owing
Tuesday
.
The
two
ladies
were
delighted
to
see
their
dear
friend
again
,
—
called
it
an
age
rince
they
had
met
,
and
relmtcrlly
asked
what
she
haul
been
doing
with
herself
rince
their
separation
.
To
the
rest
of
the
family
they
paid
little
attention
;
avoiding
Mn
Bennet
2
:
much
an
pouihle
,
saying
not
much
to
Elizabeth
,
and
nothing
at
all
to
the
others
.
They
were
noon
gone
again
,
rising
from
their
seats
with
an
activity
which
took
their
brother
by
an
rize
,
and
hurrying
off
an
if
eager
to
escape
from
Mn
ennet'r
civilitiea
.
The
prospect
of
the
Netherlield
ball
was
extremely
agreeable
to
every
female
of
the
family
.
Mn
Bennet
choae
to
consider
it
as

in

to

ILL
Eliubeth
entered
the
drawin
-mom
at
Netherﬁeld
,
and
looked
in
vain
for
r
Wickham
among
the
cluster
of
red
coats
there
assembled
,
a
doubt
of
his
being
resent
had
never
occurred
to
her
.
The
certainty
0
meeting
him
had
not
been
checked
b
any
of
those
recollections
that
might
not
unreasoua
y
have
alarmed
her
.
She
had
dressed
with
more
than
usual
care
,
and
repared
in
the
highest
s
irita
for
the
conquea
of
al
that
remained
unaubd
of
his
heart
,
trusting
that
it
was
not
more
than
might
be
won
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
But
in
an
instant
arose
the
dreadful
suspicion
of
his
being
girposely
omitted
for
Mr
Darcys
pleasure
in
the
ingleyu’
invitation
to
the
ofﬁcers
;
and
though
this
was
not
exactly
the
case
,
the
absolute
fact
of
his
absence
waa
pronounced
by
his
'
friend
Mr
Denny
,
to
whom
Lydia
eagerly
applied
,
and
who
told
them
that
Wickham
had
been
obliged
to
go
to
town
on
business
the
day
before
,
and
was
not
yet
returned
;
adding
,
with
a
signiﬁcant
smile
,
“I
do
not
imagine
his
business
would
have
called
him
away
ust
now
,
if
he
had
not
wished
to
avoid
a
certain
gen
eman
here.”
This
part
of
his
intelligence
,
though
unheard
by
Lydia
,
was
caught
by
Elizabeth
,
and
as
it
assured
her
that
Darcy
was
not
less
answerable
for
Wickham’l
absence
than
if
her
ﬁrst
surmise
had
been
just
,
every
feeling
of
displeasure
against
the
former
was
so
sh
ned
by
immediate
disappointment
,
that
she
could
ha
y
reply
with
tolerable
civility
to
the
polite
inquiriel
which
he
directly
afterwards
approach
to
make
.
Attention
,
forbearance
,
patience
with
Darcy
,
was
injury
to
Wickham
.
She
was
resolved
against
91

AND
"
IMICL
any
non
of
convenation
with
him
,
and
turned
away
with
a
degree
of
ill-humour
which
aim
could
not
wholly
tummunt
even
in
Ipeaking
to
Mr
Bingley
,
whore
blind
partiality
provoked
her
.
But
Elizabeth
was
not
formed
for
ill-humour
;
and
though
every
pmlpect
of
her
own
waa
demyed
for
the
evening
,
it
could
not
dwell
long
on
her
spirits
;
and
having
told
all
her
grief

to
Charlotte
Luna
,
whom

a

tranlition
to
the
odditia
of
her
couin
,
and
to
point
him
out
to
her
particular
notice
.
The
two
ﬁm
dancet
,
however
,
brought
a
return
of
distress
;
they
were
dances
of
monification
.
Mr
Collina
,
awkward
and
Iolemn
,
apologiaing
innead
of
attending
,
and
often
moving
wrong
without
being
aware
of
it
,
gave
her
all
the
charm
and
mitery
which
a
disagreeable
partner
for
a
couple
of
dance
:
can
give
.
The
moment
of
her
release
from
him
wu
ecmly
.
She
danced
next
with
an
officer
,
and
had
the
refreshment
of
talking
ofWickham
,
and
of
hearing
that
hewac
univenally
liked
.
When
those
dances
were
over
,
the
returned
to
Charlotte
Lucar
,
and
war
in
convenation
with
her
,
when
she
found
heruelf
luddenly
addressed
by
Mr
Darcy
,
who
took
her
so
much
by
enrprize
in
hit
application
for
her
hand
,
that
,
without
knowing
what
she
did
,
the
accepted
him
.
He
walked
away
again
immediately
,
and
the
was
left
to
fret
over
her
own
want
of
pretence
of
mind
;
Charlotte
tried
to
console
her
.
“
I
dare
say
you
will
ﬁnd
him
very
agreeable
.
'
“
Heaven
forbid
!

would
be

To
ﬁnd

!
—
Dn
not

.
'
When
the
dancing
recommenced
,
however
,
and
Darcy
approached
to
claim
her
hand
,
Charlotte
could
not
help
cautioning
her
in
a
whisper
,
not
to
be
a
Iimpleton
,
and
allow
her
fancy
for
Wickham
to
make
her
appear

.
93
pleasant
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
of
ten
times
his
consequence
.
Elizabeth
made
no
answer
,
and
took
her
place
in
the
set
,
amazed
at
the
dignity
to
which
she
we
arrived
in
being
allowed
to
stand
opposite
to
Mr
Darcy
,
and
reading
in
her
neighbours’
looks
,
their
equal
amazement
in
heholding
it
.
They
stood
for
some
time
without
aking
a
word
;
and
she
began
to
imagine
that
their
silence
was
to
last
through
the
two
dances
,
and
at
ﬁrst
was
rescind
not
to
break
it
;
till
suddenly
fancying
that
it
would
be
the
greater
punishment
to
her
partner
to
oblige
him
to
talk
,
she
made
some
slight
observation
on
the
dance
.
He
replied
,
and
was
again
silent
.
After
a
pause
of
some
minutes
,
she
addressed
him
a
second
time
with
—
“
It
is
your
turn
to
say
something
now
,
Mr
Darcy
.
I
talked
about
the
dance
,
and
you
ought
to
make
some
kind
of
remark
on
the
size
of
the
room
,
or
the
number
of
couples.”
He
smiled
,
and
assured
her
that
whatever
she
wished
him
to
say
should
be
said
.
“
V
well
.
That
reply
will
do
for
the
present
.
Perhaps
and
by
I
may
observe
that
private
balls
are
much
pleasanter
than
public
ones
.
But
now
we
may
be
silent.”
“
Do
you
talk
by
rule
,
then
,
while
you
are
dancing
?
”
“
Sometimes
.
One
must
k
a
little
,
you
know
.
It
would
look
odd
to
be
entire
y
silent
for
half
an
hour
together
;
and
yet
for
the
advantage
of
ram
,
conversation
ought
to
be
so
arranged
,
as
that
they
may
have
the
trouble
of
saying
as
little
as
possible.”
'
“
Are
you
consulting
your
own
feelings
in
the
present
case
,
or
do
you
imagine
that
you
are
gratifying
mine
2
"
“
Both
,
'
replied
Elizabeth
,
arehly
;
“
for
I
have
always
seen
a
great
similarity
in
the
turn
of
our
minds
.
We
are
each
of
an
unsocial
,
taciturn
disposition
,
unwilling
to
speak
,
unless
we
expect
to
say
something
that
94
PRIDE
AND
PRBJUDICE
.
will
amaze
the
whole
room
,
and
be
handed
down
to
pourity
with
all
the
eclat
of
a
proverb.”
“
This
is
no
very
striking
resemblance
of
your
own
character
,
I
am
mire
,
”
said
he
.
“
How
near
it
may
be
to
mine
,
I
can
not
pretend
to
my
.
Ton
think
it
a
faithful
portrait
undoubtedly.”
"
I
must
not
decide
on
my
own
performance.”
He
made
no
answer
,
and
they
were
again
silent
till
they
had
gone
down
the
dance
,
when
he
asked
her
if
the
and
her
sisters
did
not
very
often
walk
to
Merymn
?
She
answered
in
the
afﬁrmative
;
and
,
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
,
added
,
“
When
you
met
us
there
the
other
day
,
we
had
been
forming
a
new
acquaintance.”
The
elfect
was
immediate
.
A
deeper
shade
of
hauteur
overspread
his
features
,
but
he
aid
not
a
word
,
and
Elizabeth
,
though
blaming
herself
for
her
own
weakness
,
could
not
go
on
.
At
length
Darcy
spoke
,
and
in
a
conmained
manner
said
,
"
Mr
Wickham
is
blessed
with
such
happy
manners
at
my
encure
his
ruling
friends
—
whether
he
may
be
'
equally
capable
of
retaining
them
,
is
less
cenain
.
'
“
He
has
been
so
unlucky
as
to
lose
your
friendship
,
'
replied
Elizabeth
with
em
hasis
,
"
and
in
a
manner
.
which
he
it
likely
to
suffer
rom
all
his
life
.
'
Darcy
made
no
answer
,
and
seemed
desirous
of
changing
the
subject
.
At
that
moment
Sir
William
Lucas
appeared
close
to
them
,
meaning
to
pass
through
the
set
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
;
but
on
perceiving
Mr
Darcy
,
he
stopped
with
a
how
of
superior
courtesy
to
compliment
him
on
his
dancing
and
his
partner
.
“I
have
been
most
highly
gratiﬁed
indeed
,
my
dear
sir
.
Such
very
superior
dancing
is
not
often
seen
.
It
is
evident
that
you
belong
to
the
first
circles
.
Allow
me
to
say
,
however
,
that
your
fair
partner
does
not
dis
.
grace
you
,
and
that
I
must
hope
to
have
this
pleasure

AND

.
95
often
repeated
,
l
when
a
cumin
desirable
event
,
my
dar
Miss
Eliza
,
(
glancing
at
her
sister
and
Bingley
,
)
shall
take

What
congratulations
will
then
ﬂow
in
!
I
appeal
to
Mr
Darcy
:
—

You
will

me
for

you
from
the

of

,
whose
bright
eyes
are
also
upbraiding
me.”
The
latter
rt
of
this
addrcn
was
scarcely
heard
by
Darcy
;
but
William’s
allusion
to
his
friend
seemed
to
unke
him
forcibly
,
and
hi
.
eyes
were
directed
with
a
very
serious
expression
towards
Bingley
and
Jane
,
who
were
dancing
together
.
Recovering
himself
,
however
,
shortly
,
he
turned
to
his
partner
,
and
said
,
“
Sir
William’s
interruption
has
made
me
forget
what
we
.
were
talking
of
.
'
“I
do
not
think
we
were
speaking
at
all
.
Sir
William
could
not
have
interrupted
any
two
people
in
the
room
who
had
less
to
say
for
themselves
.
We
have
tried
two
or
three
subjects
already
without
success
,
and
what
we
are
to
talk
of
next
I
can
not
imagine.”
“
What
think
you
of
books
2
”
said
he
,
smiling
.
“Books
—
0h
!
no
.
I
am
sure
we
never
read
the
same
,
or
not
with
the
same
feelings.”
“
1
am
sorry
you
think
so
;
but
if
that
be
the
case
,
there
can
at
least
be
no
want
of
subject
.
We
may
compareour
different
opinions.”
“No
—
I
csnnot
talk
of
books
in
a
ball-room
;
my
head
is
always
full
of
something
else.”
“The

does
it
?
”
mid
he
,
with
a
look
of

“Yes

”
she
replied
,
without
knowing
what
the
said
,
for
her
thoughts
had
wandered
far
from
the
subject
,
as
soon
afterwards
appeared
by
her
sudden
]
exclaiming
,
“I

,
with

.
“

“

”
“
Merely
to

”
said
she
,
endeavouring
to
shake
of
her

.
“I

to

'
“And
what

”
She
shook
her
head
,
“I

I

“I

”
he
coldly
replied
.
She
said
no
more
,
and
they
went
down
the

and
parted
in
silence
;
on

side
dissatisﬁed
,
though
not
to
an
equal
degree
,
for
in
Darcy’s
breast
there
was
a
tolerable
powerful
feeling
towards
her
,
which
soon
procured
her
pardon
,
and
directed
all
his
anger
against
another
.
They
had
not
long
separated
,
when
Miss
Biugley
came
towards
her
,
and
with
an
expression
of
civil
disdain
thus
accosted
her
:
—
“
So
,
Miss
Eliza
,
I
hear
you
are
quite
delighted
with
George
Wickham
!
Your
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.
97
sister
has
been
talking
to
me
about
him
,
and
asking
me
a
thousand
uestions
;
and
I
ﬁnd
that
the
young
man
forgot
to
te
you
,
man
his
other
communications
,
that
he
was
the
son
of
old
ickhm
,
the
late
Mr
Darcy’s
steward
.
Let
me
recommend
you
,
however
,
as
a
friend
,
not
to
ve
implicit
conﬁdence
to
all
his
assertions
;
for
as
to
r
Darcy’s
using
him
ill
,
it
is
perfectly
false
;
for
,
on
the
contra
,
he
has
been
always
remarkably
kind
to
him
,
though
rge
Wickham
has
treated
Mr
Darcy
in
a
most
infamous
manner
.
I
do
not
know
the
particulars
,
but
I
know
very
well
that
Mr
Darcy
is
not
in
the
least
to
blame
,
that
he
can
not
hear
to
hear
George
Wickham
mentioned
,
and
that
though
my
brother
thought
he
could
not
well
avoid
including
him
in
his
invitation
to
the
oﬂicers
,
he
was
excessively
glad
to
find
that
he
had
taken
himself
out
of
the
way
.
His
coming
into
the
country
at
all
is
a
most
insolent
thing
,
indeed
,
and
I
wonder
how
he
could
presume
to
do
it
.
I
pity
you
,
Miss
Eliza
,
for
this
discovery
of
your
favourite’s
guilt
;
but

]
,
considering
his
descent
,

not

“His
guilt
an
his
descent
appear
by
your
account
tube
the
same
,
'
said
Elizabeth
angrily
;
“for
I
have
heard
you
accuse
him
of
nothing
worse
than
of
being
the
son
of
Mr
Darcy’s
steward
,
and
of

bar
,
I
can
assure
you
,
he
informed
me
himaelf.”
“
I
beg
your
pardon
,
'
replied
Miss
Bingley
,
turning
away
with
a
sneer
.
“
Excuse
my
interference
:
it
was
kindl
meant.”
“

"
said
Elizabeth
to
herself.
"
You
are
much

if
you

to
inﬂuence
me

such
a

attack
as
this
.
I
see
nothing
in
it
but
your

ignorance
and
the
malice
of
Mr
arcy
.
'
She
then
sought
her
eldest
sister
,
who
had
undertaken
to
make
inquiries
on
the
same
subject
of
Bingley
.
Jane

her

“
I
have

sincerity

”
laid
Elizabeth
warmly
:
"
but
.
you
must
excuse
my
not
being
convinced
by
assurances
only
.
Mr
Bingley’s
defence
of
his
friend
win
a
very
able
one
,
I
dare
say
;
but
since
he
is
nnacquainted
with
several
pom
of
the
story
,
and
has
learnt
the
rest
from
that
friend
himself
,
I
shall
venture
still
to
think
of
both
gentlemen
as
I
did
before
.
'
She
then
changed
the
discourse
to
one
more
gratifyin
to
each
,
and
on
which
there
could
be
no
difference
0
sentiment
.
Elizabeth
listened
with
delight
to
the
ha
,
though
modest
hopes
which
Jane
entertained
of
Biggiey’s
regard
,
and
sand
all
in
her
power
to
heighten
her
conﬁdence
in
it
.
On
their
being
joined
by
Mr
Binglcy
himself
,
Elizabeth
withdrew
to
Miss
Lucas
;
to
whooe
inquiry
after
the
pleasantnets
of
her
last
partner
she
had
scarcely
replied
,
before
Mr
Collins
came
up
to
them
,
and
told
her
with
great
exultation
that
he
had
just
been
so
fortunate
as
to
make
a
most
important
discovery
.
"
I
have
found
out
,
'
said
he
,
“
by
a
singular
accident
,
that
there
is
now
in
the
room
a
near
relation
of
my
patroness
.
I
happened
to
overhm
the
gentleman
himself
mentioning
to
the
young
lady
who
does
the
honours
of
this
house
the
names
of
his
cousin
Miss
de
Bourgh
,
and
of
her
mother
Lady
Catherine
.
How
wonderfully
these
sort
of
things
occur
!
Who
would
have
thought
of
or
meeting
with
,
perhaps
,
a
nephew
of
Lady
Catherine
e
Bourgh
in
this
assembly
!
I
am
most
thankful
that
the
discovery
is
made
in
time
for
me
to
pay
my
respects
to
him
,
which
I
am
now
going
to
do
,
and
trust
he
will
excuse
my
not
having
done
it
before
.
My
total
ignorance
of
the
connection
must
plead
my
apology.”
“
You
are
not
going
to
introduce
yourself
to
Mr
Dare
!
"
“l’hdeed
I
am
.
I
shall
entreat
his
pardon
for
not
having
done

.

believe

to

It
will
be

that

.
Elizabeth
tried
hard
to
dissuade
him
from
eueh
a
scheme
,
assuring
him
that
Mr
Darcy
would
consider
his
addreuing
him
without
introduction
as
an
impertinent
freedom
,
rather
than
a
compliment
to
his
aunt
;
that
it
was
not
in
the
least
necem
there
Ihould
be
any
notice
on
either
side
;
and
that
ilzit
were
,
it
must
belong
to
Mr
Darcy
,
the
superior
in
consequence
,
to
begin
the
acquaintance
.
Mr
Collins
listened
to
her
with
the
determined
air
of
following
his
own
inclination
,
and
,
when
she
ceased
speaking
,
replied
thus
:
—
“
My
dear
Min
:
Elizabeth
,
I
have
the
highest
opinion
in
the
world
of
your
excellent
judgment
in
all
matters
within
the
scope
of
your
understanding
;
but
permit
me
to
an
,
that
there
must
be
a
wide
diﬁemnce
between
the
estab
ished
forms
of
ceremony
amongst
the
laity
,
and
those
which
regulate
the
clergy
;
for
,
give
me
leave
to
observe
that
I
consider
the
clerical
ofﬁce
as
equal
in
point
of
dignity
with
the
highest
rank
in
the
kingdom
—
provided
that
a
proper
humility
of
behaviour
is
at
the
mine
time
maintained
.
You
must
therefore
allow
me
to
follow
the
dictates
of
my
conscience
on
this
occasion
,
which
leads
me
to
perform
what
I
look
on
as
a
point
of
duty
.
Pardon
me
for
neglecting
to
proﬁt
by
your
advice
,
which
on
every
other
subject
shall
be
my
constant
guide
,
though
in
the
case
before
us
I
consider
myself
more
ﬁtted
by
education
and
habitual
study
to
decide
on
what
is
right
than
a
young
lady
like
yourself.”
And
with
a
low
how
he
left
her
to
attack
Mr
Darcy
,
whose
reception
of
his
advances
she
eagerly
watched
,
and
whose
amnishment
at
being
so
addressed
was
vc
evident
.
Her
cousin
prefaCed
his
speech
with
a
soemn
bow
:
and
though
she
could
not
hear
a
word
of
it
,
she
felt
an
if
hearing
it
all
,
and
saw
in
the
motion
of
his
lips
the
words
PRIDE
AND
PIEJUDICB
.
Io
!
“apology
,
”
“Hunsford
,
”
and
“
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh.”
It
vexed
her
to
see
him
ex
himself
to
such
a
man
.
Mr
Darcy
was
eyein
im
with
unrestrained
wonder
,
and
when
at
last
Mgr
Collins
allowed
him
time
to
speak
,
replied
with
an
air
of
distant
civility
.
Mr
Collins
,
however
,
was
not
discouraged
from
king
again
,
and
Mr
Darcy’s
contempt
seemed
ahunil’aeritly
increasing
with
the
length
of
his
second
speech
,
and
at
the
end
of
it
he
only
made
him
a
slight
how
,
and
moved
another
way
.
Mr
Collins
then
returned
to
Elizabeth
.
“I
have
no
reason
,
I
assure
u
,
”
said
he
,
“robe
dissatisﬁed
with
my
reception
.
r
Darcy
seemed
much
pleased
with
the
attention
.
He
answered
me
with
the
utmost
civility
,
and
even
paid
me
the
com
liment
of
saying
,
that
he
was
so
well
convinced
of
La
y
Catherine’s
discernment
as
to
be
certain
she
could
never
bestow
a
favour
unworthily
.
It
was
really
a
very
handsome
thought
.
Upon
the
whole
,
I
am
much
pleased
with
him.”
As
Elizabeth
had
no
longer
any
interest
of
her
own
to
pursue
,
she
turned
her
attention
almost
enu‘rely
on
her
sister
and
Mr
BingIey
;
and
the
train
of
agreeable
reﬂections
which
her
observations
gave
birth
to
,
made
her
perhaps
almost
as
happy
as
Jane
.
She
saw
her
in
ides
settled
in
that
very
house
,
in
all
the
felicity
which
a
marriage
of
true
affection
could
bestow
;
and
she
felt
capable
,
under
such
circumstances
,
of
endeavouring
even
to
like
Bingley’s
two
sisters
.
Her
mother’s
thoughts
she
plainly
saw
were
bent
the
same
way
,
and
she
determined
not
to
venture
near
her
,
lest
she
might
hear
too
much
.
When
they
sat
down
to
mpper
,
therefore
,
she
considered
it
a
most
unlucky
pervemeness
which
placed
them
within
one
of
each
other
;
and
deeply
was
she
vexed
to
ﬁnd
that
her
mother
was
talking
to
that
one
person
(
Lady
Lucas
)
freely
,
openly
,
and
of
nothing

clue
but
of
her
expectation
that
Jane
would
he
soon
married
to
Mr
Bingley
.
—
It
wan
an
animating
nibject
,
and
Mn
Bennet
seemed
incapable
of
fati
ue
while
enumerating
the
advantages
of
the
match
.
in
being
each
a
charming
young
man
,
and
so
rich
,
and
living
but
three
miles
from
them
,
were
the
lint
points
of
aelfgratulation
;
and
then
it
was
such
a
comfort
to
think
how
fond
the
two
sisters
were
of
Jane
,
and
to
be
certain
that
they
must
deaire
the
connection
at
much
as
she
could
do
.
It
was
,
moreover
,
such
a
promising
thing
for
her
younger
daughterl
,
as
Jane’s
marrying
so
grady
must
throw
them
in
the
way
of
other
rich
men
;
and
lastly
,
it
was
so
pleasant
at
her
time
of
life
to
be
able
to
consign
her
single
daughters
to
the
care
of
their
sister
,
that
she
might
not
be
obliged
to
go
into
company
more
than
she
liked
.
It
was
neceaary
to
make
this
circumstance
in
matter
of
plsurc
,
because
on
such
occasions
it
is
the
etiquette
;
but
no
one
was
lest
likely
than
Mr
:
Bennet
to
ﬁnd
comfort
in
staying
at
home
at
any
period
of
her
life
.
She
concluded
with
many
good
wishez
that
Lady
Lucas
might
soon
be
equally
fortunate
,
though
cw'dently
and
triumphantly
believing
there
was
no
chance
of
it
.
In
vain
did
Elizabeth
endeavour
to
check
the
rapidity
of
her
mother’
a
words
,
or
persuade
her
to
describe
her
felicity
in
a
less
audible
whisper
;
for
,
to
her
inexpressible
vexation
,
she
could
perceive
that
the
chief
of
it
was
overheard
by
Mr
Darcy
,
who
sat
opposite
to
them
.
Her
mother
only
scolded
her
for
being
nonsensical
.
“
What
is
Mr
Darcy
to
me
,
pray
,
that
I
should
be
afraid
of
him
?
I
am
sure
we
owe
him
no
such
particular
civility
as
to
be
obliged
to
say
nothing
be

not

to

“
For

,

advantage
can
it

to

You

Nothing
that
she
could
sa
,
however
,
had
any
inﬂuence
.
Her
mother
would
k
of
her
views
in
the
same
intelligible
hone
.
Elizabeth
blushed
and
blushed
again
with
shame
and
vexation
.
She
could
not
help
frequently
glancing
her
eye
at
Mr
Dare
,
though
every
glance
convinced
her
of
what
she
drea
ed
;
for
though
he
was
not
always
looking
at
her
mother
,
she
was
convinced
that
his
attention
was
invariany
ﬁxed
by
her
.
The
expression
of
his
face
changed
gradually
from
indignant
contempt
to
a
composed
and
steady
gravig
.
At
ength
,
however
,
Mrs
Bennet
ha
no
more
to
lay
;
and
Lady
Lucas
,
who
had
been
long
yawning
at
the
repetition
of
delights
which
she
saw
no
likelihood
of
sharing
,
was
left
to
the
comforts
of
cold
ham
and
chicken
.
Elizabeth
now
began
to
revive
.
But
not
long
was
the
interval
of
tranquillity
;
for
,
when
supper
was
over
,
singing
was
talked
of
,
and
she
had
the
mortiﬁcation
of
seeing
Mary
,
after
very
little
entreaty
,
preparing
to
oblige
the
com
ny
.
By
many
signiﬁcant
looks
and
silent
entreaties
,
didnshe
endeavour
to
revent
such
a
proof
of
com
laisance
,
—
—
but
in
vain
;
ary
would
not
understand
em
;
such
an
opportunity
of
exhibiting
was
delightful
to
her
,
and
she
began
her
song
.
Elizabeth’s
eyes
were
ﬁxed
on
her
with
most
painful
se‘naations
,
and
she
watched
her
progress
through
the
several
stanzas
with
an
impatience
which
was
very
ill
rewarded
at
their
close
;
for
Ma
,
on
receiving
,
amongst
the
thanks
of
the
table
,
the
hint
of
a
hope
that
she
might
be
prevailed
on
to
favour
them
again
,
after
the
pause
of
hal
a
minute
began
another
.
Mary’s
powers
were
by
no
mans
ﬁtted
for
such
a
di
lay
;
her
voice
was
weak
,
and
her
manner
affected
—
lizaheth
was
in
agonies
.
She
looked
at
Jane
,
to
see
how
she
bore
it
;
but
Jane
was
very
composedly
talking
to
Bingley
.
She
looked
at
his
two
sisters
,
and
saw
them
making
signs
of
derision
at
each
other
,
and
at
Darcy
,
who

ever
,
impenetrably
sure
.
She
looked
at
her
father
to
entrut
his
interference
,
lest
Mary
should
be
in
‘ng
all
night
.
He
look
the
hint
,
and
when
Mary
had
niahed
her
second
song
,
said
aloud
.
“That
will
do
exle
well
,
child
.
You
have
delighted
us
long
enough
.
Let
the
other
young
ladies
have
time
to
exhilit
.
'
Mary
,
though
pretending
not
to
hear
,
was
somewhat
disconcerted
;
and
Elizabeth
,
sorry
for
her
,
and
sorry
for
her
father’s
speech
,
was
afraid
her
anxiety
had
done
no
good
.
Others
of
the
party
were
now
applied
to
.
"
If
I
,
”
said
Mr
Collins
,
“
were
so
fortunate
as
to
'
be
able
to
ring
,
I
should
have
great
pleasure
,
I
am
sure
,
in
obliging
the
company
with
an
air
;
for
I
'
music
as
a
very
innocent
divertion
,
and
perfectly
compatible
with
the
profession
of
a
clergyman
—
I
do
not
mean
,
however
,
to
assert
that
we
can
be
justiﬁed
in
devoting
too
much
of
our
time
to
music
,
for
there
are
certainly
other
things
to
be
attended
to
.
The
rector
of
a
parish
has
much
to
do
.
—
—
In
the
ﬁrst
place
,
he
must
make
such
an
agreement
for
tythea
as
may
be
beneﬁcial
to
himself
and
not
offensive
to
his
patron
.
He
must
write
his
own
sermons
;
and
the
time
that
remains
will
not
be
too
much
for
his
parish
duties
,
and
the
care
and
improvement
of
his
dwelling
,
which
he
can
not
be
excused
from
making
as
comfortable
as
possible
.
And
I
do
not
think
it
of
light
importance
that
he
should
have
attentive
and
conciliatory
manners
towards
everybody
,
especiall
towards
those
to
whom
he
owes
his
preferment
.
l
can
not
acquit
him
of
that
duty
;
nor
could
I
‘
think
well
of
the
man
who
should
omit
an
occasion
of
testif
in
his
respect
towards
any
bod
connected
with
the
mi
y.”
And
with
a
bow
to
r
Darcy
,
be
concluded
his
speech
,
which
had
been
ken
so
loud
as
to
be
heard
by
half
the
room
.
—
any
stared
—
man
smiled
;
but
no
one
looked
more
aroused
than
r
Bennet
himself
,
while
his
wife
seriously
commended
Mr
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
105
Collins
for
having
)
oken
so
sensibly
,
and
observed
in
a
half-whisper
to
La
Lucas
,
that
he
was
a
remarkably
clever
,
good
kind
of
'
young
man
.
To
Elizabeth
it
appeared
,
that
had
her
family
made
an
agreement
to
expose
themselves
as
much
as
they
Could
during
the
evening
,
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
them
to
play
their
parts
with
more
sEirit
or
liner
success
;
and
happy
did
she
think
it
for
ingley
and
her
sister
that
someof
the
exhibition
had
escaped
his
notice
,
and
that
his
feelings
were
not
of
a
sort
to
be
much
distressed
by
the
folly
which
he
must
have
witnessed
.
That
his
two
sisters
and
Mr
Darcy
,
however
,
should
have
such
an
opportunity
of
ridiculing
her
rela
<
tions
,
was
bad
enough
,
and
she
could
not
determine
whether
the
silent
contempt
of
the
gentlemen
,
or
the
insolent
miles
of
the
ladies
,
were
more
intolerable
.
The
rest
of
the
evening
brought
her
little
amusement
.
She
was
teased
by
Mr
Collins
,
who
continued
most
perseveringly
by
her
side
,
and
though
he
could
not
prevail
with
her
to
dance
with
him
again
,
put
it
out
of
er
power
to
dance
with
others
.
In
vain
did
she
entreat
him
to
stand
up
with
somebody
else
,
and
offer
to
introduce
him
to
any
young
lady
in
the
room
.
He
assured
hcr
,
that
as
to
dancing
,
he
was
perfectly
indifferent
to
it
;
that
his
chief
object
was
by
delicate
attentions
to
recommend
himself
to
her
,
and
that
he
should
therefore
make
a
point
of
remaining
close
to
her
the
whole
evening
.
There
was
no
arguing
upon
such
a
reject
.
She
owed
her
greatest
relief
to
her
friend
hiss
Lucas
,
who
often
oined
them
,
and
goodnaturedly
engaged
Mr
éollins’s
conversation
to
herself
.
She
was
at
least
free
from
the
oli‘ence
of
Mr
Darcy's
fimher
notice
;
though
often
standing
within
a
very
short
distance
of
her
,
quite
disengaged
,
he
never
came
near
enough
to
speak
.
She
felt
it

Mr

Mr

talked
only
to

HE
next

opened
a
new
scene
at

Mr

made
his
declaration
in

]
.
Having
resolved
to
do
it
without
loss
of
time
,
as
his
leave
of
absence
extended
only
to
the
following
Saturday
,
and
having
no
feelings
of
diﬂidence
to
make
it
distressing
to
himself
even
at
the
moment
,
he
set
about
it
in
a
very
orderly
manner
,
with
all
the
observanccs
,
which
be
supposed
a
regular
pan
of
the
business
.
On
ﬁnding
Mrs
Bennet
,
Elizabeth
,
and
one
of
the
younger
girls
together
,
soon
after
breakfast
,
he
addressed
the
mother
In
these
words
:
“
May
I
hope
,
madam
,
for
your
interest
with
your
fair
daughter
Elizabeth
,
when
I
solicit
for
the
honour
of
a
Frivate
audience
with
her
in
the
course
of
this
morning
?
’
Before
Elizabeth
had
time
for
anything
but
a
blush
of
surprize
,
Mrs
Benuet
instantly
answered
,
"
Oh
dear
!
—
Yes
—
certainly
.
I
am
sure
Lizzy
will
be
very
happy
—
I
am
sure
she
can
have
no
objection
.
Come
,
Kitty
,
I
want
you
upstairs.”
And
,
gathering
her
work
together
,
she
was
hastening
away
,
when
Elizabeth
called
out

PREMICI

“
Dear
ma’sm
,
do
not
go
.
I
beg
will
not
go
.
Mr
Collins
must
excuse
me
.
He
can
me
nothing
to
say
to
me
that
anybody
need
not
hear
.
I
am
going
away
myself.”
“
No
,
no
,
nonsense
,
Lizzy
.
I
desire
you
will
any
where
you
are.”
And
upon
Elizabeth’s
seeming
really
,
with
vexed
and
embarrassed
looks
,
about
to
escape
,
she
added
,
“
Lizzy
,
I
ins-in
upon
your
saying
and
hearing
Mr
Collins
.
'
Elizabeth
would
not
oppose
such
an
injunction
—
and
a
moment’s
consideration
making
her
also
sensible
that
it
would
be
wisest
to
get
it
over
us
soon
and
as
quietly
as
possible
,
she
sat
down
again
,
and
tried
to
conceal
,
by
incessant
employment
,
the
feelings
which
were
divided
between
distress
and
diversion
.
Mrs
Bennet
and
Kitty
walked
oil
,
and
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
Mr
Collins
began
.
“Believe
me
,
my
dear
Miss
Elizabeth
,
that
your
modesty
,
so
far
from
doing
you
any
disservice
,
rather
adds
to
your
other
perfections
.
You
would
have
been
less
amiable
in
my
eyes
had
there
not
been
this
little
unwillingness
;
but
allow
me
to
assure
you
,
that
I
have
our
respected
mother
s
permission
for
this
address
.
ou
can
hardly
doubt
the
purport
of
my
discourse
.
however
your
natural
delicacy
may
lead
you
to
disscmble
;
my
attentions
have
been
too
marked
to
be
mistaken
.
Almost
as
soon
as
I
entered
the
house
,
I
singled
you
out
as
the
companion
of
my
future
life
.
But
before
I
am
run
away
with
by
my
feelings
on
this
subject
,
perhaps
it
would
be
advisable
for
me
to
state
my
reasons
for
marrying
—
and
,
moreover
,
for
coming
into
Hertfordshire
with
the
design
of
selecting
a
wife
,
as
I
certainly
did.”
I
.
The
idea
of
Mr
Collins
,
with
all
his
solemn
comsure
,
being
run
away
with
by
his
feelings
,
made
lizabeth
so
near
laughing
,
that
she
could
not
use
the
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDXCE
.
109
short
pause
he
allowed
in
any
attempt
to
stop
him
farther
,
and
he
continued
:
—
“My
reasons
for
marrying
are
,
ﬁrst
,
that
I
think
it
a
right
thing
for
every
clergyman
in
easy
circummmoes
(
like
myself
)
to
set
the
example
of
matrimony
in
his
parish
;
secondly
,
that
I
am
convinced
it
will
add
very
greatly
to
my
happiness
;
and
thirdly
—
which
perhaps
I
ought
to
have
mentioned
rlier
,
that
it
is
the
particular
advice
and
recommendation
of
the
very
noble
lady
whom
I
have
the
honour
of
calling
patroness
.
Twice
has
she
condescended
to
give
me
her
opinion
gunasked
too
i
)
on
this
subject
;
and
it
was
but
the
very
aturday
night
before
I
left
Hunsfordabetween
our
pools
at
uadrille
,
while
Mrs
Jenkinson
was
arranging
Miss
de
gourgh’s
footstool
,
that
she
said
,
‘Mr
Collins
,
you
must
marry
.
A
clergyman
like
you
must
marry
.
—
Chuse
properly
,
chuse
a
gentlewnman
for
my
sake
;
and
for
your
0101
!
,
let
her
be
an
active
,
useful
sort
of
person
,
not
brought
up
high
,
but
able
to
make
a
small
income
go
a
good
way
.
This
is
my
advice
.
Find
such
a
woman
as
soon
as
you
can
,
bring
her
to
Hunsford
,
and
I
will
visit
her.’
Allow
mc
,
by
the
way
,
to
observe
,
my
fair
cousin
,
that
I
do
not
reckon
the
notice
and
kindness
of
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
as
among
the
least
of
the
advantages
in
my
power
to
oﬁer
.
You
will
ﬁnd
her
manners
beyond
anythingI
can
describe
;
and
your
wit
and
vivacity
,
I
think
,
must
be
acceptable
to
her
,
especially
when
tempered
with
the
silence
and
respect
which
her
rank
will
inevitably
excite
.
Thus
much
for
my
general
intention
in
favour
of
matrimony
;
it
remains
to
be
told
why
my
views
were
directed
to
Longbonrn
instead
of
my
own
neigh‘
bourhood
,
where
I
assure
you
there
are
many
amiable
ung
women
.
But
the
fact
is
,
that
being
,
as
I
am
,
to
Inherit
this
estate

the
death
of
your

"
I
am
not
now
to

,
”
replied
Mr
Collins
,
with
a
formal
wave
of
the
hand
,
“
that
it
is
usual
with
young
ladies
to
reject
the
addresaes
of
the
man
whom
they
secretly
mean
to

when
he

the

I

therefore
by
no

you

“
Upon
my
word
,
air
,
'
cried
Elizabeth
,
“
your
hope
is
rather
an
extraordinary
one
after
my
declaration
.
I
do
assure
you
that
I
am
not
one
of
those
young
ladies
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.
III
(
ifsuch
young

there

who
are
so
daring
as
to
risk
their
ha
iness
on
the
chance
of
being
asked
a
second
time
.
i
?
am
perfectly
serious
in
my
retinal
.
You
could
not
make
"
I
!
happy
,
and
I
am
convinced
that
I
am
the
last
woman
in
the
world
who
would
make
you
so
.
Nay
,
were
your
friend
Lady
Catherine
to
know
me
,
I
am
rsuaded
she
would
ﬁnd
me
in
every
respect
ill
qualiﬁ
for
the
situau'on.”
“Were
it
certain
that
Lady
Catherine
would
think'
so
,
'
aid
Mr
Collins
very
gravely
—
“but
I
can
not
imagine
that
her
ladyship
would
at
all
disapprove
of
you
.
And
you
may
be
certain
that
when
I
have
the
honour
of
seeing
her
again
,
I
shall
speak
in
the
highest
terms
of
your
modesty
,
economy
,
and
other
amiable
qualiﬁcations.”
“
Indeed
,
Mr
Collins
,
all
praise
of
me
will
be
unnecessary
.
You
must
give
me
leave
to
for
myself
,
and
pay
me
the
compliment
of
believing
what
I
say
.
I
wish
you
very
happy
and
very
rich
,
and
by
refusing
your
hand
,
do
all
in
my
power
to
prevent
your
being
otherwise
.
In
making
me
the
offer
,
you
must
have
satisﬁed
the
delicacy
of
your
feelings
with
regard
to
my
family
,
and
ma
take
possession
of
Longboum
esmte
whenever
it
fa
ls
,
without
any
self-reproach
.
This
matter
may
be
considered
,
therefore
,
as
ﬁnally
settled
.
'
And
rising
as
she
thus
spoke
,
she
would
have
quitted
the
room
,
had
not
Mr
Collins
thus
addressed
her
:
“
When
I
do
myself
the
honour
of
speaking
to
you
next
on
the
subject
,
I
shall
hope
to
receive
a
more
favourable
answer
than
you
have
now
given
me
;
though
I
am
far
from
accusing
you
of
eluelty
at
present
,
because
I
know
it
m
be
the
established
custom
of
your
sex
to
reject
a
man
on
the
ﬁrst
appliution
,
and
perhaps
you
have
even
now
said
as
much
to
encourage
my
suit
as
would
be
consistent
with
the
true
delicacy
of
the
female

R
COLLINS
was
not
left
long
to
the
silent
contemplau'on
of
his
successful
love
;
for
Mrs
Bennet
,
having
dawdled
about
in
the
vestibule
to
watch
for
the
end
of
the
conference
,
no
sooner
saw
Elizabeth
open
the
door
and
with
quick
step
pass
her
towards
the
staircase
,
than
she
entered
the
breakfastroom
,
and
congratulated
both
him
and
herself
in
warm
terms
on
the
happy
prospect
of
their
nearer
connection
.
Mr
Collins
received
and
returned
these
felicitations
with
equal

leasure
,
and
then
proceeded
to
relate
the
particulars
0
their
interview
,
with
the
result
of
which
he
trusted
he
had
every
reason
to
be
satisﬁed
,
since
the
refusal
which
his
cousin
had
steadfastly
given
him
would
naturally
flow
from
her
bashful
modesty
and
the
genuine
delicacy
of
her
character
.
This
information
,
however
,
startled
Mrs
Bennet
;
—
she
would
have
been
glad
to
be
equally
satisﬁed
that
her
daughter
had
meant
to
encourage
him
b
protesting
against
his

she

“

Mr

;

I

She

hurrying
instantly
to
her

called
out

PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
Not
yet
,
however
,
in
spite
of
her
dinppointment
in
her
husband
,
did
Mrs
Bonnet
give
up
the
point
.
She
talked
to
Elizabeth
again
and
again
;
coaxed
and
threatened
her
by
turns
.
She
endeavoured
to
secure
Jane
in
her
interest
;
but
Jane
,
with
all
lmssible
mildnets
,
declined
interfering
;
and
Elizabeth
,
sometimes
with
real
earnestness
,
and
sometimes
with
playful
gaiety
,
replied
to
her
attacks
.
Though
her
manner
mried
,
however
,
her
determination
never
did
.
Mr
Collins
,
meanwhile
,
was
meditating
in
solitude
on
what
had
passed
.
He
thought
too
well
of
himself
to
comprehend
on
what
motive
his
cousin
could
refuse
him
;
and
though
his
pride
was
hurt
,
he
suffered
in
no
other
way
.
His
regard
for
her
was
quite
imaginary
;
and
the
possibility
of
her
deserving
her
mother’s
reproach
prevented
his
feeling
any
regret
.
While
the
family
were
in
this
confusion
,
Charlotte
Lucas
came
to
ad
the
day
with
them
.
She
was
met
in
the
vestibule
?
e
Lydia
,
who
,
ﬂying
to
her
,
cried
in
a
half
whisper
,
“

Charlotte
had
hardly
time
to
answer
,
before
they
were
joined
by
Kitty
,
who
came
to
tell
the
urne
news
;
and
no
sooner
had
they
entered
the
breakfast-room
,
where
Mrs

was
alone
,
than
the
likewise
hogan
on

,
calling
on
Miss
Lucas
for
her
compassion
,
and
entreating
her
to
persuade
her
friend
Lizzy
to
comply
with
the
wishes
of
all
her
family
.
“

sensible
that

would
only
increase

She

HE
discussion
of
Mr
Collina'l
offer
was
not
nearly
at
an
end
,
and
EH72th
had
only
to
suffer
from
the
uncomfortable
feeling
:
neoeanarily
attending
it
,
and
occasionally
from
name
peeviah
allusion
of
her
mother
.
A

feelingl
were
chieﬂ
expressed
,
not
by
embarruemen
:
or
dejection
,
or
y
trying
to
avoid
her
,
but
by
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.
H9
stilTness
of
manner
and
resentful
silence
.
He
scarcely
ever
spoke
to
her
,
and
the
assiduous
attentions
which
he
had
been
so
sensible
of
himself
were
transferred
for
the
rest
of
the
day
to
Miss
Lucas
,
whose
civility
in
listening
to
him
was
a
sessonahle
relief
to
them
all
,
and
especially
to
her
friend
.
The
marrow
roduced
no
abatement
of
Mrs
Bennet’s
ill
humour
or
il
health
.
Mr
Collins
was
also
in
the
same
state
of
angry
pride
.
Elizabeth
had
hoped
that
his
resentment
might
shorten
his
visit
,
but
his
plan
did
not
appear
in
the
least
affected
by
it
.
He
was
always
to
have
gone
on
Saturday
,
and
to
Saturday
he
still
meant
to
stay
.
After
breakfast
,
the
girls
walked
to
Meryton
to
inquire
if
Mr
Wickham
were
returned
,
and
to
lament
over
his
absence
from
the
Netherﬁeld
ball
.
He
joined
them
on
their
entering
the
town
,
and
attended
them
to
their
aunt’s
,
where
his
regret
and
vexation
,
and
the
concern
of
everybody
,
was
well
talked
oven
—
To
Elizabeth
,
however
,
he
voluntarily
acknowledged
that
the
necessity
of
his
absence
bad
been
self-imposed
.
"
I
found
,
'
said
he
,
“
as
the
time
drew
near
that
I
had
better
not
meet
Mr
Dnrcy
;
—
—
-that
to
be
in
the
same
room
,
the
same
party
with
him
for
so
many
hours
together
,
might
be
more
than
I
could
bear
,
and
that
scenes
might
arise
unpleasant
to
more
than
myself
.
'
She
highly
approved
his
forbearance
,
and
they
had
leisure
for
a
full
discussion
of
it
,
and
for
all
the
commendation
which
they
civilly
bestowed
on
each
other
,
as
Wickham
and
another
oﬂicer
walked
back
with
them
to
Longboum
,
and
during
the
walk
he
particularly
attended
to
her
.
His
accompanying
them
was
a
double
advantage
;
she
felt
all
the
compliment
it
offered
to
herself
,
and
it
was
most
acceptable
as
an
occasion
of
introducing
him
to
her
father
and
mother
.
Soon
after
their
return
,
a
letter
was
delivered
to
12°
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICL
Miss
Bonnet
;
it
came
from
Netherﬁeld
,
and
was
opened
immediately
.
The
envelope
contained
a
sheet
0
elegant
,
little
,
hot-pressed
palm
,
well
covered
with
a
lady
s
fair
,
ﬂowing
hand
;
and
Elizabeth
saw
her
sister‘s
countenance
change
as
she
read
it
,
and
saw
her
dwelling
intently
on
some
particular
passages
.
Jane
recollected
herself
soon
,
and
putting
the
letter
away
,
tried
to
join
with
her
usual
cheerﬁilness
in
the
general
conversation
;
but
Elizabeth
felt
an
anxiety
on
the
subject
which
drew
off
her
attention
even
from
Wickham
;
and
no
sooner
had
he
and
his
compaiiion
taken
leave
,
than
a
glance
from
Jane
invited
her
to
follow
her
upstairs
.
When
they
had
gained
their
own
room
,
Jane
,
taking
out
her
letter
,
said
,
“
This
is
from
Caroline
Bingley
;
what
it
contains
has
surprized
me
a
good
deal
.
The
whole
party
have
left
Netherfield
by
this
time
,
and
are
on
their
way
to
town
—
and
without
any
intention
of
coming
back
again
.
You
shall
hear
what
she
says
.
'
She
then
read
the
ﬁrst
sentence
aloud
,
which
comprised
the
information
of
their
having
just
resolved
to
follow
their
brother
to
town
directly
,
and
of
their
meaning
to
dine
that
day
in
Grosvenor
Street
,
where
Mr
Hurst
had
a
house
.
The
next
was
in
these
words
:
"
I
do
not
pretend
to
regret
anything
I
shall
leave
in
Hertfordshire
,
except
your
society
,
my
dearest
friend
;
but
we
will
hope
,
at
some
future
period
,
to
enjoy
many
returns
of
that
delightful
intercourse
we
have
known
,
and
in
the
meanwhile
may
lessen
the
pain
of
separation
by
a
very
frequent
and
most
unreserved
correspondence
.
I
depend
on
you
for
that.”
To
these
high-ﬂown
ex
resaions
Elizabeth
listened
with
all
the
insensibility
o
distmst
;
and
though
the
suddenness
of
their
removal
surprized
her
,
she
saw
nothing
in
it
really
to
lament
:
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
their
absence
from
Netherfield
would
prevent
Mr
Bingley’s
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.
I“
being
there
;
and
as
to
the
loss
of
their
wail-e3
,
she
was
persuaded
that
Jane
must
soon
cease
to
reg
it
,
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
.
“
It
is
unluck
,
”
said
she
,
after
a
short
yause
,
“
that
you
should
not
he
able
to
see
your
friends
before
they
eave
the
country
.
But
may
we
not
hope
that
the
gﬁod
of
future
happiness
to
which
Miss
Bingley
looks
rwsrd
may
arrive
earlier
than
she
is
aware
,
and
that
the
delightful
intercourse
you
have
known
as
friends
will
be
renewed
with
yet
greater
satisfaction
as
sisters
?
Mr
Bingley
will
not
be
detained
in
London
by
them.”
“Caroline
decidedly
says
that
none
of
the
party
will
return
into
Hertfordshire
this
winter
.
I
will
read
it
to
on
:
—

“‘When
my
brother
left
us
yesterday
,
he
imagined
that
the
business
which
took
him
to
London
might
be
concluded
in
three
or
four
days
;
but
as
we
are
certain
it
can
not
be
so
,
and
at
the
same
time
convinced
that
when
Charles
gets
to
town
he
will
be
in
no
hurry
to
leave
it
again
,
we
have
deunnined
on
following
him
thither
,
that
he
may
not
be
obliged
to
spend
his
vacant
hours
in
:
I
comfortless
hotel
.
Many
of
my
acquaintance
are
already
there
for
the
winter
;
I
wish
l
could
hear
that
you
,
my
dearest
friend
,
had
any
intention
of
making
one
in
the
crowd
—
but
of
that
I
desyair
.
I
ineerely
hope
your
Christmas
in
Hertfordshlre
may
abound
in
the
gaieties
which
that
season
generally
brings
,
and
that
your
beaux
will
he
so
numerous
as
to
prevent
your
feeling
the
loss
of
the
three
of
whom
we
shall
d
rive
you.’
”
“
It
is
evident
by
this
,
'
added
Jane
,
“
that
he
comes
back
no
more
this
winter.”
“It
is
only
evident
that
Miss
Bingley
does
not
mean
he
should.”
“Why
will
you
think
so
?
It
must
be
his

doing

is

M.
I
will
read
you
the
passage
which
particularly
hurts
me
.
I
will
have
no
reserves
ﬁ'om
you
.
“‘Mr
Darcy
is
impatient
to
see
his
sister
;
and
,
to
coufem
the
truth
,
we
are
scarcely
less
eager
to
meet
her
again
.
I
really
do
not
think
Georgiana
Darcy
has
her
equal
for
beauty
,
elegance
,
and
accomplishments
;
and
the
affection
she
inspires
in
Louisa
and
myself
is
heightened
into
something
still
more
interesting
.
from
the
hope
we
dare
to
entertain
of
her
being
hereafter
our
sister
.
I
do
not
know
whether
I
ever
before
mentioned
to
you
my
feelings
on
this
subject
;
but
I
will
not
leave
the
country
without
conﬁding
them
,
and
I
trust
you
will
not
esteem
them
unreasonable
.
My
brother
admires
her
greatly
already
;
he
will
have
frequent
opportunity
now
of
seeing
her
on
the
most
intimate
footing
;
her
relations
all
wish
the
connection
as
much
as
his
own
;
and
at
sister’s
tartiality
is
not
misleading
me
,
I
think
,
when
I
call1
Charles
most
capable
of
engaging
any
woman’s
heart
.
With
all
these
circumstances
to
favour
an
attachment
,
and
nothing
to
prevent
it
,
am
I
wrong

my
dearest
Jane

indulging
the
hope

id
Jane
as
she
linishcd
it

“
Is
it
not
clear
enough
?
Does
it
not
expressly
declare
that
Caroline
neither
expects
nor
wishes
me
to
be
her
sister
;
that
the
is
perfectly
convinced
of

indifference
;

that

the
nature

she
means

to

“Yes

can

mine
is
totally

”
“
Most
willingly
.
'
“
You
shall
have
it
in
a
few
words

Miss
Bingley
sees
that
her
brother
is
in
love
with
you
,
and
wants
him
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.
123
to
marry
Miss
Darcy
.
She
follows
him
to
town
in
the
hope
of
keeping
him
there
,
and
tries
to
penuade
you
that
he
does
not
care
about
you
.
'
Jane
shook
her
head
.
“Indeed
,
Jane
,
you
ought
to
believe
me.—
No
one
who
has
ever
seen
you
together
can
doubt
his
affection
.
Miss
Bingley
,
I
am
sure
,
can
not
.
She
is
not
such
a
simpleton
.
Could
she
have
seen
half
as
much
love
in
Mr
Darcy
for
herself
,
she
would
have
ordered
her
wedding
clothes
.
But
the
case
is
this
:
—
We
are
not
rich
enough
or
grand
enough
for
them
;
and
she
is
the
more
anxious
to
get
Miss
Darcy
for
her
brother
,
from
the
notion
that
when
there
has
been
an
:
intermarriage
,
she
may
have
less
trouble
in
achieving
a
second
;
in
which
there
is
certainly
some
ingenuity
,
and
X
dare
say
it
would
succeed
,
if
Miss
de
Bourgh
were
out
of
the
way
.
But
,
my
dearest
Jane
,
you
can
not
seriously
imagine
that
because
Miss
Bingley
tells
you
her
brother
early
admires
Miss
Darcy
,
he
is
in
the
smallest
degree
Ens
sensible
of
your
merit
than
when
he
took
leave
of
you
on
Tuesday
,
or
that
it
will
be
in
her
power
to
persuade
him
that
,
instead
of
being
in
love
with
you
,
he
is
very
much
in
love
with
her
friend.”
“If
we
thought
alike
of
Miss
Bingley
,
”
replied
Jane
,
"
your
representation
of
all
this
might
make
me

}
;
easy
.
But
I
know
the
foundation
is
unjust

line
is
incapable
of
wilfully
deceiving
any
one
;
and
all
that
I
can
hope
in
this
case
is
that
she
is
deceived
herself.”
'
“That
is
righL
—
You
could
not
have
started
a
more
happy
idea
,
since
you
will
not
take
comfort
in
mine
.
Believe
her
to
be
deceived
,
by
all
means
.
You
have
now
done
your
duty
by
her
,
and
must
fret
no
longer.”
“But
,
my
dear
sister
,
can
I
be
happy
,
even
supposing
the
best
,
in
accepting
a
man
whose
sisters
and
friends
are
all
wishing
him
to
marry
elsewhere

You
must

for
yourself

aid
Eliubeth
;
“and
if
,
upon
mature
deliberation
,
you
find
that
the
misery
of
disobliging
his
two
lineris
more
than
equivalent
to
the
happinesslof
being
his
wife
,
I
advise
you
b
all

refuse
him.”
“
ow
can
you
talk
so
?
"
said
Jane
,
faintly
smiling
.
“You
must
know
that
though
I
should
be
exceedingly
grieved
at
their
disapprobation
,
I
could
not
hesitate.”
“I
did
not
think
you
would
:
and
that
being
the
case
,
I
can
not
consider
your
situan'on
with
much
compassion
.

“
But
if
he
returns
no
more
this
winter
,
my
choice
will
never
be
required
.
A
thousand
things
may
arise
in
six
months
!
”
The
idea
of
his
returning
no
more
Elizabeth
treated
with
the
utmost
contempt
.
Itappcared
to
her
merely
the
suggestion
of
Cnrolinc’s
interested
wiahcl
,
and
she
could
not
for
a
moment
suppose
that
those
wishes
,
however
openly
,
or
artfully
spoken
,
could
inﬂuence
a
young
man
so
totally
independent
of
every
one
.
She
represented
to
her
sister
as
forcibly
as
possible
what
she
felt
on
the
subject
,
and
had
soon
the
pleasure
of
seeing
in
happy
effect
.
Jane’s
temper
was
not
desponding
,
and
she
was
gradually
led
to
hope
,
though
the
diﬂidence
of
affection
sometimes
overcame
the
hope
,
that
Bingley
would
return
to
Netherlield
and
answer
eve
wish
of
her
heart
.
hey
agreed
that
Mrs
Bennet
should
only
hear
of
the
departure
of
the
family
,
without
being
alarmed
on
the
score
of
the
gentleman’s
conduct
;
but
even
this
partial
communication
gave
her
a
great
deal
of
concern

the
bewailed
it
an
exceedingly
unlucky
that
the
ladies
should
happen
to
go
away
just
as
they
were
all
getting
to

together
.
After
lamenting
it
,
however
,
at
some
length
,
she
had
the
consolation
of
thinking
that

HE
Bonnets
were
engaged
to
dine
with
the
Lucases
,
and
again
during
the
chief
of
the
da
was
Miss
Lucas
so
kind
as
to
listen
to
r
Collins
.
Elizabeth
took
an
opportunit
of
thanking
her
.
“
It
keeps
him
in
good
humour

”
szri
she
,
“
and
I
am
more
obliged
to
you
than
I
can

Charlotte
assured
her
friend
of
her
satisfaction
in
being
useful
,
and
that
it
amPly
repaid
her
for
the
little
sacriﬁce
of

was
very
amiable
,
but
Charlotte’s
kindness
extended
farther
than
Elizabeth
had
any
conception
of
;
—
its
object
was
nothing
else
than
to
secure
her
from
any
return
of
Mr
Collins’s
addresses
,
by
engaging
them
towards
herself
.
Such
was
Miss
Lucas’s
scheme
;
and
appearances
were
so
favourable
,
that
when
they
parted
at
night
,
nhu
would
have
felt
almost
sure
of
success
if
he
hurl
not
been
to
leave
I-lcrtfordshirc
so
very
soon
.
But
here
she
did
injustice
to
the
tire
and
independence
of
his
character
,
for
it
led
him
to
escape
out
of
Longbourn
House
the
next
morning
with
admirable
slyness
,
and
hasten
to
Lucas
Lodge
to
throw
himself
at
her
feet
.
He
was
anxious
to
avoid
the
notice
of
his
cousins
,
from
a
conviction
that
if
they
saw
him
depart
,
they
could
not
fail
to
conjecture
his
design
,
and
he
was
not
willing
to
have
the
attempt
known
till
its
success
could
be
known
likewise
;
for
though
feeling
almost
secure
,
and
with
reason
,
for
Charlotte
had
been
tolerably
encouragin
he
was
comparatively

"
Sir
William
and
Lady
Lum
were
Ipeedily
applied
to
for
their
consent
;
and
it
was
bestowed
with
a
moot
alacrity
.
Mr
Collina
s

circumstances
made
it
a
most
eligible
match
or
their
daughter
,
to
whom
they
could
give
little
fortune
;
and
his
impacts
of
future
wealth
were
exceedingly
fair
.
Ladpy
Lucas
began
directly
to
calculate
,
with
more
interest
than
the
matter
had
over
excited
lit-fore
,
how
many
years
longer
Mr
Bennet
was
likely
to
live
;
and
Sir
William
gave
it
as
his
decided
opinion
,
that
whenever
Mr
Collins
should
he
in
possession
of
the
Longboum
estate
,
it
would
be
highly
expedient
that
both
he
and
his
wife
should
make
their
appearance
at
St
Jam’s
.
The

hopes
of
coming

a

or
two
sooner
than
they
might
otherwise
have
done
;
and
the
boys
were
relieved
from
their
apprehension
of
Charlotte’c
dying
an
old
maid
.
Charlotte
herself
was

AND

.
127
ably
composed
.
She
had
gained
her
point
,
and
had
time
to
consider
of
it
.
Her
reﬂections
were
in
general
satisfactory
.
Mr
Collins
,
to
be
sure
,
was
neither
sensible
nor
agreeable
;
his
society
was
irksorne
,
and
his
attachment
to
her
must
be
imaginary
.
But
still
he
would
be
her
husband
.
Without
thinkin
highly
either
of
men
or
of
matrimony
,
maniage
had
airways
been
her
object
;
it
was
the
only

well-educated

women
of
small
fortune
,
and
however
uncertain\
of
giving
happiness
,
must
be
their
plmsantest
preservative
from
want
.
This
reservative
she
had
now
obtained
;
and
at
the
age
0
twenty-seven
,
without
having
ever
been
handsome
,
she
felt
all
the
good
luck
of
it
.
The
least
agreeable
circumstance
in
the
business
was
the
surprize
it
must
occasion
to
Elizabeth
Bennet
,
whose
friendsiip
she
valued
beyond
that
of
any
other
person
.
Elilabeth
would
wonder
,
and
probably
would
blame
her
;
and
though
her
resolution
was
not
to
be
shaken
,
her
feeings
must
be
hurt
by
such
a
disapprobation
.
She
resolved
to
give
her
the
information
herself
,
and
therefore
clnrged
Mr
Collins
,
when
he
returned
to
Longbourn
to
dinner
,
to
drop
no
hint
of
what
had
passed
before
my
of

family
.
A

of
secrecy
was

it
could
not

difﬁculty
;
or
the

excited
by
his
long
shame
burst
forth
in
such
very

questions
on
his

as
required
some
ingenuity
to
evade
,
and
he
was
at
the
same
time
exercising
great
self-denial
,
for
he
was
longing
to
publish
his
prosperous
love
.
As
he
was
to

‘his

the

With
proper
civilities
the
ladies
then
withdrew
;
all
of
them
equally
eurprized
to
ﬁnd
that
he
meditated
a
quick
return
.
Mn
Bennet
wished
to
understand
by
it
that
he
thought
of
paying
his
addresses
to
one
of
her
younger
girls
,
and
Mary
might
have
been
prevailed
on
to
accept
him
.
She
rated
his
abilitien
much
higher
than
any
of
the
othera
;
there
was
a
solidity
in
his
reﬂections

1

which
often
struck
her
,
and
though
by
no
means
so
clever
as
herself
,
she
thought
that
if
encouraged
to
read
and
improve
himself
by
such
an
example
as
hers
,
he
might
become
a
very
agreeable
companion
.
But
on
the
following
morning
,
every
hope
of
this
kind
was
done
away
.
Miss
Lucas
called
soon
after
breakfast
,
and
in
a
private
conference
with
Elizabeth
related
the
event
of
the
day
before
.
The
possibility
of
Mr
Collins’s
fancying
himself
in
love
with
her
friend
had
once
occurred
to
Elizabeth
within
the
last
day
or
two
;
but
that
Charlotte
could
encourage
him
seemed
almost
as
far
from
possibility
as
she
could
encourage
him
herself
,
and
her
astonishment
was
con
uently
so
great
as
to
overcome
at
ﬁrst
the
bounds
of
ecorum
,
and
she
could
not
help
crying
out—
“Engaged
to
Mr
Collins
!
my
dear
Charlotte
,
—
im
ble
!
"
he
steady
countenance
which
Miss
Lucas
had
commanded
in
telling
her
story
,
gave
way
to
a
momentary
confusion
here
on
receiving
so
direct
a
reproach
;
though
,
‘as
it
was
no
more
than
she
ex
,
she
soon
regained
her
composure
,
and
calmly
rep
iod
—
“Why
should
you
be
surprised
,
my
dear
Eliza
?
—
Do
you
think
it
incredible
that
Mr
Collins
should
be
able
to
procure
any
woman’s
good
opinion
,
because
he
was
not
so
happy
as
to
succeed
with
you
2
”
But
Elizabeth
had
now
reeollected
herself
,
and
making
a
strong
effort
for
it
,
was
able
to
assure
her
with
tolerable
ﬁrmness
that
the
prospect
of
their
relationship
was
highly
grateful
to
her
,
and
that
she
wished
her
all
imaginable
happiness
.
“I
see
what
you
are
feeling
,
”
replied
Charlotte
,
—
"
you
must
be

much
surprised

Elizabeth
quietly

“Undoubtedly

an
awkward
pause
,
they
returned
to

of
the
ﬁimily

Nothing

the

could
have
home
without
anger
such
treatment
;
but
Sir
William’s
good

him
through
it
all
;
and
though
he
begged
ve
to
be
positive
as
to
the
truth
of
his
informau'on
,
he
listened
to
all
their
impertinence
with
the

forbearing
munecy
.
Elizabeth
,
feeling
it
incumbent
on
her
to
relieve
him
from
so
unpleasant
a
situation
,
now
put
herself
forward
to
conﬁrm
his
account
,
by
mentioning
her
rior
knowledge
of
it
from
Charlene
herself
;
and
en
eavoured
to
put
a
stop
to
the
exclamation
:
of
her
mother
and
sisters
y
the
earnestness
of
her
congratulations
to
Sir
William
,
in
which
the
was
readin
joined
by
Jane
,
and
by
making
a
variety
of
remarks
on
the
happinese
that
might
be
expected
from
the
match
,
the
excellent
character
of
Mr
Collins
,
and
the
convenient
distance
of
Hunsford
from
London
.
Mrs
Bennet
was
in
fact
too
much
overpowered
to
say
a
great
dal
while
Sir
William
remained
;
but
no
sooner
had
he
left
them
than
her
feelings
found
a
rapid
vent
.
In
the
ﬁrst
place
,
she
persisted
in
diebelieving
the
whole
of
the
matter
;
secondly
,
she
was
very
sure
that
Mr

had
been
taken
in
;
thirdly

she
trusted
that
they
would
never

;
and
fourthly
,
that

might

Two
inferences
,
however
,
were
plainly
deduced
from
the
whole
:
one
,
that
Elizabeth
was
the
real
cause
of
all

that

A
week
elapsed
before
she
could

Eliubeth
without
scolding
her
,
a
month
away
before
she
could
speak
to
Sir
William
or
y
Lucas
without
being
rude
,
and
many
months
were
gone
before
she
could
at
all
forgive
their
daughter
.
Mr
Bennet
s
emotions
were
much
more
tranquil
on
the
occasion
,
and
such
as
he
did
experience
he
pronounced
to
be

Jane
confessed
herself
a
little
surprised
at
the
match
;
but
she
said
less
of
her
astonishment
than
of
her
eamest
desire

happiness
;
nor
could
Elizabeth
rsuade
her
to
consider
it
as
improbable
.
Kitt
an
Lydia
were
far
from
envying
Miss
Lucas
,
for
r
Collins
was
only
a
clergyman
;
and
it
aﬂ‘ccted
them
in
no
other
way
than
at
a
piece
of
news
to
spread
at

Meryton
.
Lady
Lucas
could
not
be
insensible
of
triumph
on
being
able
to
retort
on
Mrs
Bennet
the
comfort
of
having
a
daughter
Well
married
;
and
she
called
at
Longboum
rather
oftener
than
usual
to
say
how
luppy
she
was
,
though
Mrs
Bennet
s
sour
looks
and
ill-natured
remarks
might
have
been
enough
to
drive
happiness
away
.
Between
Elizabeth
and
Charlotte
there
was
a
restraint
which
he
t
them
mutually
silent
on
the
sub'ect
;
and
Elizabeth
elt
persuaded
that
no

her

,
of
whose
reclitude
and
delicacy
she
was
sure
her
opinion
could
never
be
shaken
,
and
for
whose
bappiness
she
grew
daily
more
anxious
,
as
Bingley
had
now
been
gone
a
week
,
and
nothing
was
heard
of
his
return
.
Jane
had
sent
Caroline
on
early
answer
to
her
letter
,
PRIDE
AN
D
PREJUDICE
.
I

and
was
counting
the
days
till
she
might
reasonably
hope
to
hear
again
.
The
promised
letter
of
thank
:
from
Mr
Collins
arrived
on
Tuesda
,
addressed
to
their
father
,
and
written
with
all
the
soemnity
of
gratitude
which
a
twelvemonth
s
abode
in
the
family
might
have
prompted
.
After
discharging
his
conscience
on
that
head
,
he
proceeds
to
inform
them
,
with
many
rapturous
ex
ressions
,
of
his
ha
iness
in
havin
obtained
the
aﬂfcﬁon
of
their
amia
Fe
neighbour
,
bliss
Lucas
,
and
then
explained
that
it
was
merel
with
the
view
of
enjoying
her
society
that
he
had
en
so
ready
to
close
with
their
kind
wish
of
seeing
him
again
at
Longbourn
,
whither
he
ho
to
be
able
to
return
on
Monday
fortnight
;
for
ady
Catherine
,
he
added
,
so
heartily
approved
his
marriage
,
that
she
wished
it
to
take
place
as
soon
as
possible
,
which
he
tnxstcd
would
be
an
unanswerable
argument
with
his
amiable
Charlotte
to
name
an
early
day
for
making
him
the
happiest
of
men
.
Mr
Collim’s
return
into
Hertfordshire
was
no
longer
a
mixer
of
pleasure
to
Mrs
Bennet
.
On
the
contrary
,
she
was
as
much
disposed
to
complain
of
it
as
her
husband
—
It
was
very
strange
that
he
should
come
to
Longboum
instead
of
to
Lucas
Lodge
;
it
was
also
very
inconvenient
and
exceedingly
troublesome
—
She
hated
having
visitors
in
the
house
while
her
health
was
so
indifferent
,
and
lovers
were
of
all
people
the
most
disagreeable
.
Such
were
the
entle
murmurs
of
Mrs
Bennet
,
and
they
gave
way
on
y
to
the
greater
distress
of
Mr
Bingley
s
continued
absence
.
Neither
Jane
nor
Elizabeth
were
comfortable
on
this
subject
.
Day
after
day
passed
away
without
bringing
any
other
tidings
of
him
than
the
report
which
shortly
revailed
in
Meryton
of
his
coming
no
more
to
Nethe
eld
the
whole
winter
;
a
report
which
highly
incensed
Mrs
Bennet
,
and
which
she
never
failed
to
contradict
Is
a
most
scandalous
falsehood
.

Even
Elizabeth
began
to
fear
—
not
that
Bingley
wan
indifferent
—
but
that
hie
listen
would
be
meanful
in
keeping
him
away
.
Unwilling

,
and
to

to

mhility
of
her
lover
,
the
could
not

and
of

,

by
the
attractions

Darcy
and
the
nmunemenu
of
London
,
might
be
too
much
,
she
feared
,
for
the
otrength
of
his
attachment
.
Al
for
Jane
,
ber

under

,
of

,
more
painful
than

and
between

and
Elinbeth
,
therefore
,
the
lubject

never
nlluded

.
But
as
no
such
delimcy
remained
her
mother
,
an
hour
neldom
lasted
in
which
she
did
not
talk
of
Binglcy
,
expreu
her
impatience
for
his
arrival
,
or
even
require
Jane
to
confess
that
if
he
did
not
come
hack
,
the
should
think
heruelf
very
ill
used
.
It
needed
all
Jane’s
neatly
milan
to
hear
these
attach
with
tolerable
tranquillity
.
Mr
Collins
returned
most
punctually
on
the
Monday
fortnight
,
but
his
reception
at
Longbourn
war
:
not
quite

)
gracious
an
it
had
been
on
hit
lint
introduction
.
He
was
too
happy
,
however
,
to
need
much
attention
;
and
,
luckily
for
the
others
,
the
business
of
love-making
lelieved
them
from
a
great
deal
of
his
company
.
The
chief
of
every
day
was
spent
by
him
at
Lucas
Lodge
,
and
he
sometime
:
retumed
to
onghourn
only
in
time
to
make
an
apology
for
hi0
absence
before
the
family
went
to
bed
.
Mrs
Bennet
wan
really
in
a
most
pitiahle
state
.
The
very
mention
of
anything
concerning
the
match
threw
her
into
an
agony
of
ill-humour
.
and
wherever
she
went
she
was
sum
of
hearing
it
talked
of
.
The
sight
of
Miss
Lucas
was
odious
to
her
.
As
her
tucccuor
in
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE‘
135
that
house
,
she
regarded
her
with
jealous
abhorrenee
.
Whenever
Charlene
came
to
see
them
,
she
concluded
her
to
be
anticipating
the
hour
of
Immersion
;
and
whenever
she
spoke
in
a
low
voice
to
Mr
Collins
,
was
convinced
that
they
were
talking
of
the
Longboum
estate
,
and
resolving
to
turn
herself
and
her
daughter
:
out
of
the
house
,
as
soon
as
Mr
Bennet
were
dead
.
She
complained
bitterly
of
all
this
to
her
husband
.
“
Indeed
,
Mr
Bennet
,
”
said
she
,
“it
is
very
hard
to
think
that
Charlotte
Lucas
should
ever
be
mistress
of
this
house
,
that
I
should
be
forced
to
make
way
for

and

to
see
her
take
my
place
in
it

such
loorny
thoughts
.
Let
us
hope
for
better
things
.
ct
us
ﬂatter
ourselves
that
I
may
be
the
survivor.”
This
was
not
very
consoling
to
Mrs
Bonnet
,
and
,
therefore
,
instead
of
making
any
answer
,
she
went
on
as
before
.
“I
can
not
bear
to
think
that
they
should
have
all
this
estate
.
If
it
was
not
for
the

I

“I

“

BING'LEY
S
letter
.m'ved
,
and
put
an
end
to
doubt
.
The
ve
ﬁrst
sentence
conveyed
the
assurance
of
their
being
all
tetded
in
London
for
the
winter
,
and
concluded
with
her
brother’s
regret
at
not
having
had
time
to
pay
his
respects
to
hit
friend
:
in
Hertfordnhire
before
he
left
the
country
.
Hope
wan
over
,
entirely
over
;
and
when
Jane
could
attend
to
the
rest
of
the
letter
,
the
found
little
,
except
the
profch
affection
of
the
writer
,
that
could
give
her
any
comfort
.
Mia
Darcy’s
praise
occupied
the
chief
of
it
.
Her
many
attractions
were
again
dwelt
on
,
and
Caroline
boasted
joyfully
of
their
increasing
intimacy
,
and
ventured
to
predict
the
accorn
lishment
of
the
wishes
which
had
been
unfolded
in
her
ormcr
letter
.
She
wrote
also
with
great
pleasure
of
her
brother‘s
being
an
inmate
of
Mr
Darcy’s
house
,
and
mentioned
with
rapture
:
some
plans
of
the
latter
with
regard
to
new
ﬁrmiture
.
Elizabeth
,
to
whom
Jane
very
soon
communicated
the
chief
of
all
this
,
heard
it
in
silent
indignation
.
Her
heart
was
divided
between
concern
for
her
sister
,
and
resentment
against
all
others
.
To
Caroline’t
assertion
of
her
brother’s
being
partial
to
Miss
Darcy
the
id
no
credit
.
That
he
was
really
fond
of
Jane
,
she
oubted
no
more
than
she
had
ever
done
;
and
much
no
she
had
always
been
disposed
to
like
him
,
she
could
not
think
without
anger
,
hardly
without
contempt
,
on
that
easinesn
of
temper
,
that
want
of
pro
r
relolutionhwhich
now
made
him
the
slave
of
his
enigning
friends
,
and
led
him
to
sacriﬁce
his
own
happiness
to
the
caprice
of
their
inclinations
.
Had
his
own
happiness
,
however
.
been
the
only
sacriﬁce
,
he
might
have
been
allowed
to
sport
with
it
in
whatever
manner
he
thought
best
;
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.
137
but
her
inter’s
was
involved
in
it
,
as
she
thought
he
must
be
sensible
himself
.
It
was
a
subject
,
in
short
,
on
which
reﬂection
would
be
long
indulged
,
and
must
beunavniling
.
She
could
think
of
nothing
else
;
and
yet
whether
Bingley’s
regard
had
really
died
away
,
or
were
suppressed
by
his
friends’
interference
;
whether
he
had
been
aware
of
Jane’s
attachment
,
or
whether
it
had
escaped
his
observation
;
whatever
were
the
case
,
though
her
opinion
of
him
must
be
materially
affected
by
the
dilference
,
her
sister’s
situation
remained
the
same
,
her
peace
equally
wounded
.
A
day
or
two
passed
before
Jane
had
courage
to
k
of
her
feelings
to
Elizabeth
:
but
at
last
,
on
Mrs
net’s
leaving
them
together
,
after
a
longer
irritau'on
than
usual
about
Netherﬁeld
and
its
master
,
she
could
not
help
laying
,
“
0
that
my
dear
mother
had
more
command
over
herself
I
she
can
have
no
idea
of
the
pain
she
gives
me
by
her
continual
reﬂections
on
him
.
But
I
will
not
rcpine
.
It
can
not
last
long
.
He
will
be
forgot
,
and
we
shall
all
be
as
we
were
before.”
Elizabeth
looked
at
her
sister
with
incredulous
solicitudc
,
but
said
nothing
.
“You
doubt
me
,
”
cried
Jane
,
slightly
colouring
;
“indeed
you
have
no
reason
.
He
may
live
in
my
memory
as
the
most
amiable
man
of
my
acquaintance
,
but
that
is
all
.
I
have
nothing
either
to
hope
or
fear
,
and
nothing
to
reproach
him
with
.
Thank
God
!
I
have
not
[
bill
pain
.
A
little
time
therefore
—
I
shall
certainly
try
to
get
the
better.”
With
a
stronger
voice
she
soon
added
,
“I
have
this
comfort
immediately
,
that
it
has
not
been
more
than
an
error
of
fancy
on
my
side
,
and
that
it
has
done
no
harm
to
an
one
but
myself
.
'
“

exclaimed
Elizabeth
,
“you

'
Min
Bennet
eagerly
disclaimed
all
extraordinary
merit
,
and
threw
back
the
praise
on
her
sister
s
warm
allection
.
“
Nay
,
'
said
Elizabeth
,
“this
is
not
fair
.
Tau

to
think
all
the
world

ctable
,

if
I

you

disaau'sﬁed

characters
,
and
of
the
little
dependence
that
can
be
placed
on
the
appearance
of

or
sense
have
met
with
two
instances
lately
,
one
I
will
not

;
the
other
is
Charlotte’s
marriage

It
is
unaccountable

view
it

“
My
dear
Lizzy
,
do
not
give
way
to
such
feelings
as
these
.
They
will
ruin
your
happiness
.
You
do
not
make
allowance
enough
for
difference
of
situation
and
temper
.
Consider
Mr
Collins’s
respectability
,
and
Charlotte
s
prudent
,
steady
,
character
.
Remember
that
she
is
one
of
a
large
family
;
that
as
to
fortune
,
it
is
a
most
eligible
match
;
and
be
ready
to
believe
,
for
everybody’s
sake
,
that
she
may
feel
something
like
regard
and
esteem
for
our
cousin
.
'
“
To
oblige
you
,
I
would
try
to
believe
almost
anything
,
but
no
one
else
could
be
beneﬁted
by
such
a
belief
as
this
;
for
were
I
pemuaded
that
Charlotte
had
any

I
should
only

worse
of
her

than
I

My
PRIDE
AND
PEEJUDICE
.
I39
dear
Jane
,
Mr
Collins
is
a
conceited
,
pompous
,
narrowminded
,
silly
man
;
you
know
he
is
,
as
well
as
I
do
:
and
you
must
feel
,
as
well
as
I
do
,
that
the
woman
who
marries
him
can
not
have
a
proper
way
of
thinking
.
You
shall
not
defend
her
,
though
it
is
Charlotte
Lucas
.
You
shall
not
,
for
the
sake
of
one
individual
,
change
the
meaning
of
principle
and
integrity
,
nor
endeavour
to
rsuade
ourself
or
me
,
that
selﬁshness
is
prudence
,
insenlihility
of
danger
security
for
happiness.”
“I
must
think
our
language
too
strong
in
king
of
ho
,
”
replied
ane
;
“
and
I
hope
you
willfconvinoed
of
it
,
by

But
enough
of
this
.
You
a
luded
to
something
else

You
mentioned
two
instances
.
I
can
not
misunderstand
you
,
but
I
entreat
you
,
dear
Lizzy
,
not
to
pain
me
by
thinking
that
perm
to
blame
,
and
saying
your
opinion
of
him
is
sunk
.
We
must
not
be
so
ready
to
fancy
ourselves
intentionally
injured
.
We
must
not
expect
a
lively
young
man
to
be
always
so
guarded
and
circumspect
.
It
is
very
often
nothing
but
our
own
vanity
that
deceives
us

it

.
“And
men
take
care
that
they
should.”
“If
it
is
designedly
done
,
they
can
not
be
justiﬁed
;
but
I
have
no
idea
of
there
being
so
much
design
in
the
world
as
some
persons
imagine
.
'
“
I
am
far
from
attributing
any
part
of
Mr
BingIey’s
conduct
to
design
,
”
said
Elizabeth
;
"
but
without
scheming
to
do
wrong
,
or
to
make
others
unhappy
,
there
may
be
error
,
and
there
maybe
misery

Thoughtleslness

want

do

not
oppose
such
a

from

Mr

was
scarcely

there
seemed
little
chance
of
her
ever
considering
it
with
less
perplexity
.
Her
daughter
endeavoured
to
convince
her
of
what
she
did
not
believe
herself
,
that
his
attentions
to
Jane
had
been
merely
the
effect
of
a
common
and
transient
liking
,
which
ceased
when
he
saw
her
no
more
;
but
though
the
probability
of
the
statement
was
admitted
at
the
time
,
she
had
the
same
story
to
repeat
every
day

Mrs
Bennet’s
best
comfort
was
that
Mr
Bingley
must
be
down
again
in
the
summer

Mr
Bennet
treated
the
matter
differently

a
week
spent
in
profemions
of
love
and
schemes
of
feliuty
,
Mr
Collins
was
called
from
his
amiable
Charlotte
by
the
arrival
of
Saturday
.
The
pain
of
separation
,
however
,
might
be
alleviated
on
his
side
,
by
preparations
for
the
reception
of
his
bride
;
as
he
had
reason
to
hope
,
that
shortl
after
his
next
return
into
Hertfordshire
,
the
day
wou
d
be
liXed
that
was
to
make
him
the
happiest
of
men
.
He
took
leave
of
his
relations
at
Longbonm
with
as
much
solemnity
as
before
;
wished
his
fair
cousins
hulth
and
happiness
again
,
and
promised
their
father
another
letter
of
thanks
.
On
the
following
Monday
,
Mrs
Bennet
had
the
pleasure
of
receiving
her
brother
and
his
wife
,
who
came
as
usual
to
spend
the
Christmas
at
Longbourn
.
Mr
Gardiner
was
a
sensible
,
gentlemanlike
man
,
greatly
superior
to
his
sister
,
as
well
by
nature
as
edumdon
.
The
Netherﬁeld
ladies
would
have
had
difﬁculty
in
believing
that
a
man
who
lived
by
trade
,
and
within
view
of
his
own
warehouses
,
could
have
been
so
well-bred
and
agreablc
.
Mrs
Gardiner
,
who
was
several
years
younger
than
Mrs
Bennet
and
Mrs
Phillips
,
was

amiable
,
intelligent
,
elegant
woman
,
and
a
great
favourite
with
all
her
Longbourn
nieces
.
Between
the
two
eldest
and
herself
especially
,
there
subsisted
a
very
Particular
regard
.
They
had
frequently
been
staying
With
her
in
town
.
The
ﬁrst
part
of
Mrs
Gardiner
'
s
business
on
her
arrival
was
to
distribute
her
presents
and
describe
the
newest
fashions
.
When
this
was
done
she
had
a
less
active
part
to
play
.
It
became
her
turn
to
listen
.
Mrs
Bennet
had
many
grievances
to
relate
,
and
much
to
complain
of
.
They
had
all
been
very
ill-used
since
she

aw
her
sister
.
Two
of
her
iris
had
been
on
the

there
was

“I

she
continued
,
“for
Jane

have
got

if
she
could

But
Lizzy
!
oh
,

it
is
very
hard
to
think
that
she
might
have
been
Mr
Collins
s
wife
by
this
time
,
had
it
not
been
for
her
own
perverseness
.
He
made
her
an
offer
in
this
very
room
,
and
she
refused
him
.
The
consequence
of
it
is
,
that
Lady
Lucas
will
have
a
daughter
married
before
I
have
,
and
that
Longboum
estate
is
just
as
much
entailed
as
ever
.
The
Lucases
are
very
artful
people
indeed

They
are
all
for
what
they
can

I
am
sorry
to
say
It
of
them
,
but
so
it
is
.
It
makes
me
very
nervous
and
poorly
,
to
be
thwarted
so
in
my
own
family
,
and
to
have
neighbours
who
think
of
themselves
before
an
body
else
.
However
,
your
coming
just
at
this
time
is
the
greatest
of
comforts

I
am
very
glad
to
hear
what
you
tell

made
her
sister
a
slight
answer

in
compassion
to
her
nieces

conversation

Mr

accompanied

Charlotte

I

Elizabeth
shook
her
head
over
this
letter
.
It
con’
vineed
her
that
accident
only
could
discover
to
Mr
Bingley
her
sister’s
being
in
town
.
Four
weeks
passed
away
,
and
Jane
saw
nothing
of
him
.
She
endeavoured
to
persuade
herself
that
she
did
not
regret
it
;
but
she
could
no
longer
be
blind
to
Miss
Bingley’s
inattention
.
After
waiting
at
home
every
morning
for
a
fortnight
,
and
inventing
every
evening
a
fresh
excuse
for
her
,
the
visitor
did
at
last
appear
;
but
the
shortness
of
her
sta
,
and
yet
more
,
the
alteration
of
her
manner
,
would
al
ow
Jane
to
deceive
herself
no
longer
.
The
letter
which
she
wrote
on
this
occasion
to
her
sister
will
prove
what
she
felt
.
“
My
dearest
Lizzy

,
I
am

,

harshly
,
I
should
be
almost

to
say
that
there
it
a
strong
appearance
of
duplicity
in
all
this
.
But
I
will
endeavour
to
banirh
every
painful

and
think
only
of
what
will
make

—
your

the

from

very

Miss
Bingley
said
Iomething
of
his
never

,
of
giving
up
the
house
,
but
not
with
any

This
letter
gave
Elizabeth
some
pain
;
but
her
rpirita
returned

considered
that
Jane
would
no
longer
be
PRIDE

PREJUDICL
153
duped
,
by
the
sister
at
least
.
All
expectation
flout
the
brother
was
now
absolutely
over
.
She
would
not
even
wish
for
any
renewal
of
his
attentions
.
His
character
sunk
on
every
review
of
it
;
and
as
a
punishment
for
him
,
as
well
as
a
possible
advantage
to
Jane
,
she
seriously
hoped
he
might
really
soon
marry
Mr
Darcy’s
sister
,
as
by
Wickham’s
account
,
she
would
make
him
abundantly
regret
what
he
had
thrown
away
.
Mrs
Gardiner
about
this
time
reminded
Elizabeth
of
her
promise
concerning
that
gentleman
,
and
required
information
;
and
Elizabeth
had
such
to
send
as
might
rather
give
contentment
to
her
aunt
than
to
herself
.
His
apparent
partiality
had
subsided
,
his
attentions
were
over
,
he
was
the
admirer
of
some
one
else
.
Elizabeth
was
watchful
enough
to
see
it
all
,
but
she
could
see
it
and
write
of
it
without
material
pain
.
Her
heart
had
been
but
slightly
touched
,
and
her
vanity
was
mtisﬁed
with
believing
that
lb
:
would
have
been
his
only
choice
,
had
fortune
permitted
it
.
The
sudden
acquisition
of
ten
thousand
pounds
was
the
most
remarkable
charm
of
the
young
lady
to
whom
he
was
now
rendering
himself
agreeable
;
but
Eliubeth
,
less
clear-sighted
perhaps
in
this
case
than
in
Charlotte
s
,
did
not
quarrel
with
him
for
his
wish
of
independence
.
Nothing
,
on
the
contrary
,
could
he
more
natural
;
and
while
able
to
suppose
that
it
cost
him
a
few
struggles
to
relinquish
her
,
she
was
read
to
allow
it
a
wise
and
desirable
measure
for
both
,
an
could
we
sincerely
wish
him
happ
.
All
this
was
“Knowledng
to
Mrs
Gardiner
;
and
after
relating
the
circumstances
,
she
thus
went
on
:
—
“

that

take
Elizabeth
to
Hunsford
.
She
had
not
at
ﬁrst
thought
very
seriously
of
going
thither
;
but
Charlotte
,
she
soon
found
,
was
depending
on
the
plan
,
and
she
gradually
learned
to
consider
it
herself
with
greater
pleasure
as
well
as
greater
certainty
.
Absence
had
increased
her
desire
of
seeing
Charlotte
again
,
and
weakened
her
disgust
.
of
Mr
Collins
.
There
was
novelt
in
the
scheme
,
and
as
,
with
such
a
mother
and
such
uncompanionable
sisters
,
home
could
not
be
faultless
,
a
little
change
was
not
unwelcome
for
its
own
sake
.
The
‘ourney
would
moreover
give
her
a
peep
at
Jane
;
and
,
in
short
,
as
the
time
drew
near
,
she
would
have
been
very
sorry
for
any
delay
.
Everything
,
however
,
went
on
smoothly
,
and
was
ﬁnally
settled
according
to
Charlotte’s
ﬁrst
sketch
.
She
was
to
accompany
Sir
William
and
his
second
daughter
.
The
improvement
of
spending
a
night
in
London
was
added
in
time
,
and
the
plan
betarne
perfect
as
plan
could
be

The
only
pain
was
in
leaving
her
father
,
who
would
certainly
miss
her
,
and
who
,
when
it
came
to
the
int
,
so
little
liked
her
going
,
that
he
told
her
to
write
to
him
,
and
almost
promised
to
answer
her
letter
.
The
farewell
between
herself
and
Mr
Wickham
was
perfectly
friendly
;
on
his
side
even
more
.
His
present
ursnit
could
not
make
him
forget
that
Elizabeth
had
n
the
ﬁrst
to
excite
and
to
deserve
his
attention
,
the
first
to
listen
and
to
pity
,
the
ﬁrst
to
be
admired
;
and
in
his
manner
of
bidding
her
adieu
,
wishing
her
every
enjoyment
,
reminding
her
of
what
she
was
to
expect
in
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
,
and
trusting
their
opinion
of
her
—
their
opinion
of
everybody
—
would
always
coincide
,
there
was
a
solicitudc
,
an
interest
which
she
felt
must
ever
attach
her
to
him
with
a
most
sincere
regard
;
and
she
parted
from
him
convinced
that
,
whether
married
or
single
,
he
must
always
be
her
model
of
the
amiable
and
pleadng
.
Her
fellow-travellers
the
next
day
were
not
of
a
kind
to
make
her
think
him
less
agreeable
.
Sir
William
Lucas
,
and
his
daughter
Maria
,
a
good-humoured
girl
,
but
as
empty-headed
as
himself
,
had
nothing
to
say
that
could
be
worth
hearing
,
and
were
listened
to
with
about
as
much
delight
as
the
rattle
of
the
chaise
.
Elizabeth
loved
absurdities
,
but
she
had
known
Sir
William’s
too
long
.
He
could
tell
her
nothing
new
of
the
wonders
of
his
presentation
and
knighthood
;
and
his
civilities
were
worn
out
,
like
his
infomation
.
It
was
a
journey
of
on
]
twent
-four
miles
,
and
they
began
it
so
early
as
to
in
racechnrch
Street
by
noon
.
As
they
drove
to
Mr
Gardiner’s
door
,
Jane
was
at
a
drawing-room
window
watching
their
arrival
;
when
they
entered
the
passage
she
was
there
to
welcome
them
,
and
Elizabeth
,
looking
earnestly
in
her
face
,
was
pleased
to
see
it
healthful
and
lovely
as
ever
.
On
the
stairs
were
a
troop
of
little
boys
and
girls
,
whose
eagerneu
for
their
cousin’s
appeannce
would
not
allow
them
r
56
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.
to
wait
in
the
drawing-room
,
and
whose
shyness
,
as
they
had
not
seen
her
for
a
twelvemonth
,
prevented
their
coming
lower
.
All
was
joy
and
kindneu
.
The
day
passed
most
pleasantly
away
;
the
morning
in
hustle
and
shopping
,
and
the
evening
at
one
of
the
theatres
.
Elizabeth
then
contrived
to
sit
by
her
aunt
.
Their
ﬁrst
subject
was
her
sister
;
and
she
was
more
grieved
than
astonished
to
hear
,
in
reply
to
her
minute
inquiriel
,
that
though
Jane
always
stmggled
to
mpport
her
spirits
,
there
were
riods
of
dejectinn
.
It
was
reasonable
,
however
,
to
ope
that
they
would
not
continue
long
.
Mrs
Gardiner
gave
her
the
particulars
also
of
Miss
Bingley’
:
visit
in
Gmcechurch
Street
,
and
repeated
convemtions
occurring
at
diﬁ‘erent
times
between
Jane
and
herself
,
which
proved
that
the
former
had
,
from
her
heart
,
given
up
the
acquaintance
.
Mrs
Gardiner
then
rallied
her
niece
on
Wickham’s
desertion
,
and
corn
limented
her
on
hearing
it
so
well
.
“
But
,
my
dear
liubeth
,
”
the
added
,
“what
sort
of
girl
it
Miss
King
?
I
should
be
sorry
to
think
our
friend
mercenary.”
“
Pray
,
my

,
what

the
diﬂ'erence
in

Last
Christmas

were

of

is
trying
to
get
a

only
ten
thousand
pounds
,
you
want
to
ﬁnd
out
that
he
is

“If
you
will
only
tell
me
what
sort
of

Miss

is
,
I
shall
know
what
to

“
She
is
a

believe

I
know
no

“
But

paid
her
not

But
there
seems

in
directing
his
attention
towards
her
so
soon
after
this

Before
they
were
separated
by
the
conclusion
of
the
play
,
she
had
the
unexpected
happiness
of
an
invitation
to
accompany
her
uncle
and
aunt
in
a
tour
of
pleasure
which
they
proposed
taking
in
the
summer

“We

Mrs

VERY
object
in
the
next
day’s
journey
was
new
and
interesting
to
Elizabeth
;
and
her
spirits
were
in
a
state
of
enjoyment
;
for
she
had
seen
her
sister
looking
so
well
as
to
banish
all
{
ear
for
her
health
,
and
the
rospect
of
her
northern
tour
was
a
constant
source
a
delight
.
When
they
left
the
high
road
for
the
lane
to
Huntfoul
,
every
eye
was
in
search
of
the
Parsonage
,
and
eve
turning
expected
to
bring
it
in
view
.
The
paling
of
osings
Park
was
their
boundary
on
one
side
.
Elizabeth
smiled
at
the
recollection
of
all
that
she
had
heard
of
its
inhabitants
.
At
length
the
Parsonage
was
discernible
.
The
garden
sloping
to
the
road
,
the
house
standing
in
it
,
the
green
pales
,
and
the
laurel
hedge
,
everything
declared
they
were
arriving
.
Mr
Collins
and
Charlotte
appeared
at
the
door
,
and
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
small
gate
which
led
by
a
short
gravel
walk
to
the
house
amidst
the
nods
and
smiles
of
the
whole
party
.
In
a
moment
they
were
all
out
of
the
chaise
,
rejoicing
PRIDE
AND

at
the
sight
of
each
other
.
Mrs
Collins
welcomed
her
friend
with
the
liveliest
pleasure
,
and
Elizabeth
was
more
and
more
satisﬁed
with
coming
when
she
found
herself
so
aﬂ'ectionately
reCeived
.
She
saw
instantly
that
her
cousin’s
manners
were
not
altered
by
his
marriage
;
his
formal
civility
was
just
what
it
had
been
,
and
he
detained
her
some
minutes
at
the
ate
to
hear
and
satisfy
his
inquiries
aﬁer
all
her
ﬁrm
'
y
.
They
were
then
,
with
no
other
delay
than
his
pointing
out
the
neatness
of
the
entrance
,
taken
into
the
house
;
and
as
soon
as
they
were
in
the
lour
he
welcomed
them
a
second
time
,
with
ostentatious
formality
,
to
his
humble
abode
,
and
punctually
repeated
all
his
wife’s
oiiers
of
refreshment
.
Eliubeth
was
prepared
to
see
him
in
his
glory
;
and
she
could
not
help
fancying
that
in
di
laying
the
good
proportion
of
the
room
,
its
aspect
an
?
its
furniture
,
he
addressed
himself
particularly
to
her
,
as
if
wishing
to
make
her
feel
what
she
had
lost
in
refusing
him
.
But
though
everything
seemed
neat
and
comfortable
,
she
was
not
able
to
gratify
him
by
any
sigh
of
repentance
,
and
rather
looked
with
wonder
at
her
friend
that
she
could
have
so
cheerful
an
air
with
such
a
companion
.
When
Mr
Collins
said
anything
of
which
his
wife
might
reasonably
be
ashamed
,
which
certainly
was
not
unseldom
,
she
involuntarily
turned
her
eye
on
Charlotte
.
Once
or
twice
she
could
discern
a
faint
blush
;
but
in
eneml
Charlotte
wisely
did
not
hear
.
After
sitting
ong
enough
to
admire
every
article
of
furniture
in
the
room
,
from
the
sideboard
to
the
fender
,
to
give
an
account
of
their
’oumey
,
and
of
all
that
had
happened
in
London
,
Mr
éollins
invited
them
to
take
a
stroll
in
the
garden
,
which
was
large
and
well
laid
out
,
and
no
the
cultivation
of
which
he
attended
himself
.
To
work
in
his
arden
was
one
of
his
most
respectable
pleasures
;
and
Elizabeth
admired
the

of

Charlotte

of

allowing

an

to

be
aaked
for
,
every
view
we
pointed
out
with
a
minuteneat
which
left
beauty
entirely
behind
.
He
could
number
the
ﬁeld
:
in
every
direction
,
and
could
tell
how
many
trees
there
were
in
the
most
distant
clump
.
But
of
all
the
Vler
which
his
garden
,
or
which
the
country
or
the
kingdom
could
boast
,
none
were
to
be

with
the
protpect
of
Rosings
,
afforded
by
an
opening
in
the
trees
that
bordered
the
park
nearly
opporite
the
front
of
his
house
.
It
was
a
handsome
modern
building
,
well
aituated
on
rising
ground
.
From

,
Mr
Collins
would
have

;
and

accompanied

Charlotte
took

well

,

mpposed

She
had
already

that

in

.
It
was
spoken
of
again
while
they
were
at
dinner
,
when
Mr
Collins
oining
in
,
observed
—
—
“Yet

,
and
I
doubt
not
but
you
will
be
honoured
with
some
portion
of
her
notice
when

is
over
.
I
have
scarcely
any
hesitation
in
saying
that
she
will
include
you
and
my
sister
Maria
in
every
invitation
with
which
she
honours
us
during
your
stay
here
.
Her
behaviour
to
my

Charlotte
is

added
Charlotte
,
“
and
a
most
attentive
neighbour.”
“

what
I
say
.
She

of

whom

much
deference.”
The
evening
was
spent
chieﬂy
in
talking
over
Hertfordshire
news
,
and
telling
again
what
had
been
already
written
;
and
when
it
closed
,
Eliubeth
,
in
the
solitude
of
her
chamber
,
had
to
meditate
upon
Charlotte’s
degree
of
contentment
,
to
understand
her
address
in
guiding
,
and
com
sure
in
bearing
with
,
her
husband
,
and
to
acknowledge
that
it
was
all
done
very
well
.
She
had
also
to
anticipate
how
her
visit
would
pass
,
the
quiet
tenour
of
their
usual
employments

the
vexatious
interruptions
of
Mr
Collins
,
and
the
gaieties
of
their
intercourse
with
Rosings

A
lively
imagination
soon
settled
it
all
.
About
the
’middle
of
the
next
day
,
as
she
was
in
her
room
getting
ready
for
a
walk
,
a
sudden
noise
below
seemed
to
speak
the
whole
house
in
confusion
;
and
,
after
listening
a
moment
,
she
heard
somebody
mnning
gpstairs
in
a
violent
hurry
,
and
calling
loudly
after
her
.
he
opened
the
door
and
met
Maria
in
the
landing
place
,
who
,
breathless
with
agitation
,
cried
out
—
“
Oh

would
tell

and
down
they
ran
into
the

fronmd
the

,
in

of
this
wonder
!
it
was
two
ladies
stopping
in

it
nothing

“
La
!
my

,

said
Maria
,
quite
shocked
at
the
mistake
,
“
it
is
not
Lady

she
could
be

“
She
is
abominany
rude
to
keep

this

“Oh

the

of

when

“
I
like
her
appearance

said
Elizabeth
,
struck
with
other
ideas

“She
looks
sickly
and
cross

Yes
,
she

do
for
him
very
well

She
will
make
him

r
Collins
and
Charlotte
were
both
standing
at
the
gate
in
conversation
with
the
ladies
;
and
Sir
William
,
to
Elizabeth
s
high
diversion
,
was
stationed
in
the
doorway
,
in
earnest
contemplation
of
the
greatness
before
him
,
and
constantly
bowing
whenever
Miss
de
Bourgh
looked
that
way
.
At
length
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
;
the
ladies
drove
on
,
and
the
others
returned
into
the
house
.
Mr
Collins
no
sooner
saw
the
two
girls
than
he
to
congratulate
them
on
their
good
fortune
,
which
Charlotte
explained
by
letting
them
know
that

R
COLLINS’S
triumph
,
in
consequence
of
this
invitation
,
was
complete
.
The
power
of
displaying
the
grandeur
of
his
patronesl
to
his
wondering
visitors
,
and
of
letting
them
see
her
civility
towards
himself
and
his
wife
,
was
exactly
what
he
had
wished
for
;
and
that
an
opportunity
of
doing
it
should
be
given
so
soon
,
was
such
an
instance
of
Lady
Catherine’s
candescension
,
as
he
knew
not
how
to
admire
enough
.
“
I
confess
,
”
said
he
,
“
that
I
should
not
have

Scarcer

Such

and
her
manner

quite
frightened

who
had

she
looked

When
they
ascended

Maria’s
alarm
was
every

and
even
Sir
William
did

chamber
,
to
the
room
where
Lady
Catherine
,
her
daughter
,
and
Mrs
Jenkinson
were
sitting
.
Her
ladyIh
'
with
great
condescension
,
arose
to
receive
them
;
an
as
Mrs
Collins
had
settled
it
with
her
husband
that
the
ofﬁce
of

should
be

,
it

.
In
spite
of
having
been
at
St
James’s
Sir
William
was
so
completely
awed
by
the
grandeur
surrounding
him
,
that
he
had
but
just
courage
enough
to
make
a
very
low
bow
,
and
take
his
sent
without
saying
a
word
;
and
his
daughter
,
frightened
almost
out
of
her
senses
,
rat
on
the
edge
of
her
chair
,
not
knowing
which
way
to
look
.
Elizabeth
found
herself
quite
equal
to
the
scene
,
and
could
observe
the
three
ladies
before
her
composedly
.
—
Lady
Catherine
was
a
tall
,
large
woman
,
with
strongly-marked
features
,
which
might
once
have
been
handsome
.
Her
air
was
not
conciliating
,
nor
was
her
manner
of
receiving
them
such
as
to
make
her
visitors
forget
their
inferior
rank
.
She
was
not
rendered
formidable
by
silence
;
but
whatever
she
said
was
spoken
in
so
authoritative
a
tone
,
as
marked
her
selfimportance
,
and
brought
Mr
Wickham
immediately
to
Elizabeth’s
mind
;
and
horn
the
observation
of
the
day
altogether
,
she
believed
Lady
Catherine
to
be
exactly
what
he
had
represented
.
When
,
after
examining
the
mother
,
in
whose
countenance
and
department
she
soon
found
some
resemblance
of
Mr
Darcy
,
she
turned
her
eyes
on
the
daughter
,
she
could
almost
have
‘oined
in
Maria’s
astonishment
at
her
being
so
thin
an
so
small
.
There
was
neither
in
ﬁgure
nor
face
any
likeness
between
the
ladies
.
Miss
de
Bourgh
was
pale
and
sickly
;
her
features
,
though
not
plain
,
were
insigniﬁcant
;
and
she
spoke
very
little
,
except
in
a
low
voice
,
to
Mrs

PRIDE

,
in

appearance
there
was
nothing
remarkable
,
and
who

entirely
engaged
in
linening
to
what
the
raid
,
and
placing
a
ocreen
in
the
proper
direction
before
her
eyes
.
After
Iitting
a
few
minutes
,
they
were
all
sent
to
one
of
the
window
:
to
admire
the
view
,
Mr
Collinl
attending
them
to
point
out
its
beautiet
,
and
Lady
Catherine
kindly
informing
them
that
it
was
much
better
worth
looking
at
in
the
summer
.
The
dinner
was
exceedingly
handeome
,
and
there
were
all
the
nenmnta
and
all
the
articlea
of
plate
which
Mr
Collinl
had
promised
;
and
,
an
he
had
likewiae
foretold
,
he
took
his
seat
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
,

and
looked
at
if
he
felt
that
I'
could
ith
nothing
greater
.
He
carved
,
and
ate
,
and
praised
with
delighted
alacrity
;
and
every
dish
was
commended
,
ﬁrst
by
him
and
then
by
Sir
William
,
who
was
now
enough
recovered
to
echo
whatever
hie
eon-inlaw
raid
,
in
I
manner
which
Elizabeth
wondered
Lady
Catherine
could
bear
.
But
Lady
Catherine
seemed
gratiﬁed
by
their
excessive
admimtion
,
and
gave
mom

tmilea
,
especially
when
any
dish
on
the
table
proved
a
novelty
to
them
.
The
party
did
not
lupply
much
convemtion
.

ready
to
speak
whenever
there
was
an
opening
,
but
she
war
seated
between
Charlotte
and
Miss

—
the
former
of
whom
wan

in

to
Lady

the

Maria
thought

out
of

question

and
the
gentlemen
did
nothing
but
eat
and
admire
.
When
the
ladies
returned
to
the
drawing-room
,
there
was
little
to
be
done
but
to
hear
Lady
Catherine
talk
,
which

in
,
delivering
her
opinion
on
every
subject
in
so
decisive
a
manner
,
as
proved
that
she
was
not
used
to
have
her
judgment
contravened
.
She
inquired
into
Charlotte’s
domestic
concerns
familiarly
and
minutely
,
and
gave
her
a
great
deal
of
advice
as
so
the
management
of
them
all
;
told
her
how
everything
ought
to
be
regulated
in
so
small
a
family
as
hers
,
and
instructed
her
as
to
the
care
of
her
cows
and
her
poultry
.
Elizabeth
found
that
nothing
was
beneath
this
great
lady’s
attention
,
which
could
furnish
her
with
an
occasion
of
dictating
to
others
.
In
the
intervals
of
her
discourse
with
Mrs
Collins
,
she
addressed
a
variety
of
questions
to
Maria
and
Elizabeth
,
but
especially
to
the
latter
,
of
whose
connections
she
knew
the
least
,
and
who
she
observed
to
Mrs
Collins
was
a
very
genteel
,
pretty
kind
of
girl
.
She
asked
her
,
at
ditherent
times
,
how
many
sisters
she
had
,
whether
they
were
older
or
younger
than
herself
,
whether
any
of
them
were
likely
to
be
married
,
whether
they
were
handsome
,
where
they
had
been
educated
,
what
carriage
her
father
kept
,
and
what
had
been
her
mother’s
maiden
name
?
—
—
Elizabeth
felt
all
the
impertinence
of
her
questions
,
but
answered
them
very
composedly
.
—
—
Lady
Catherine
then
observed
,
“
Your
father

Mr
Collins
,
I
think
.
For

sake

”
turning
to
Charlotte
,
“
I
am
glad
of
it
;
but
otherwise
I
see
no
occasion
for
entailing

“Not

“That
is
very
strange
.
But
I
suppose
you
had
no
opportunity
.
Your

should
have
taken
you
to

have
had

“We

“No

I
never

a
thing

Your

education.”
Elizabeth
could
hardly
help
smiling
as
she
assured
her
that
had
not
been
the
case
.
“
Then
,
who
taught
you
?
who
attended
to
you
?
Without
a
governess
,
you
must
have
been
neglected.”
“

with
some
families
,
I
believe
we
were
;
but
IIIClI
of

as
wished
to
learn
never

We
were
always
encouraged
to
read

had
all
the
masters
that
were
necessary

“
Aye
,
no

;
but
that
is
what
a

will
prevent
,
and
if
I
had
known
your
mother
,
I
should
have
advised
her
most
strenuously
to
engage
one

I
always
say
that
nothing
is
to
be
done
in
education
without
steady
and
regular
instruction

nobody

Elizabeth

smiling
,
“your

'
Lady
Catherine
seemed
quite
astonished
at
not
receiving
a
direct
answer
;
and
Elizabeth
suspected
herself
to

Lady

down

as

at

Lady
Catherine
was
genera
y
speaking
—
stating
the
mistakes
of
the
three
others
,
or
relating
some
anecdote
of
herself
.
Mr

was
employed
in
agreeing
to

,
thanking
her
for
every
ﬁsh
he
won

Sir
William
did
not

much
.
He
was
storing
his
memory
with
anecdotes
and
noble
names
.
When
Lady
Catherine
and
her
daughter
had
played
as
long
as
chose
,
the

were
broken
up
,
the
can-iage
was

Mrs

gratefully
accepted

and
immediately
ordered

The
party
then
gathered
round
the
ﬁre
to
hear
Lady
Catherine
determine
what
weather
they
were
to
have
on

marrow

From
these
instructions
they
were
summoned
by

WILLIAM
ﬂayed
only
a
week
at
Hun-ford
,
but
his
vilit
was
long
enough
to
convince
him
of
his
daughter’s
being
most
comfortably
Iettled
,
and
of
her
possessing
such
a
hudnnd
and
such
a
neighbour
u
were
not

with
.
While

with
them
,
Mr
Collins
devoted
his
morning
to
driving
him
out
in
his
gig
,
and
showing
him
the
country
;
but
when
he
went
away
,
the
whole
family
returned
to
their
usual
employments
,
and
Elizabeth
was
tinnkful
to
ﬁnd
that
that
they
did
not
see
more
of
her
cousin
by
the
alteration
,
for
the
chief
of
the
time
between
breakfast
and
dinner
was
now
passed
by
him
either
at
work
in
the
garden
,
or
in
mding
and
writing
,
and
looking
out
of
window
in
his
own
hook-room
,
which
fronted
the
road
.
The
room
in
which
the
ladies
at
was
backwards
.
Elizabeth
at
ﬁrst
had
rather
wondered
that
Charlotte
should
not
prefer
the
dining-parlour
for
common
use
;
it
was
a
better
rized
room
,
and
had
a
pleasantcr
nape-ct
;
but
she
noon
saw
that
her
friend
had
an
excellent
reason
for
what
the
did
,
for
Mr
Collins
would
undoubtedly
have
been
much
less
in
his
own
apartment

sat
in

;
and
she
gave
Charlotte
ﬁt
for

y
From
the
drawing-room
they
could
distingnith
nothing
in
the
lane
,
and
were
indebted
to
Mr
Collins
for
the
knowledge
of
what
carriages
went
along
,
and
how
often
especially
Mina
de
Bonrgh
drove
by
in
her
phaemn
,
which
he
never
failed
coming
to
inform
them
of
,
thou
h
it
happened
almost
every
day
.
She
not
unfrequentlly
stopped
at
the
Parsonage
,
and
had
a
few
minutes’
conversation
with
Charlotte
,
but
was
scarcely
ever
prevailed
on
to
get

walk
to
Ratings
,
and
not
may
in
which
his
wife
did
not
thinlt
it
necessary
to
go
likewise
;
and
till
Elizabeth
recollected
that
there
might
be
other
family
livings
to
he
'
of
,
she
could
not
understand
the
sacrifice
of
so
many
hours
.
New
and
then
they
were
honoured
with
a
call
from
her
lady-hip
,
and
nothing
escaped
her
observation
that
was
passing
in
the
room
during
these
visits
.
She
examined
into
their
employments
,
looked
at
their
work
,
and
advised
them
to
do
it
differently
;
found
fault
with
the
arrangement
of
the
ﬁrmiture
,
or
detected
the
housemaid
in
negligence
;
and
if
she
accepted
any
refreshment
,
seemed
to
do
it
only
for
the
sake
of
ﬁndin
out
that
Mrs
Collins’l
joints
of
meat
were
too
large
or
her
family
.
Elizabeth
soon
perceived
,
that
though
thin
great
lady
was
not
in
the
commission
of
the
peace
for
the
county
,
the
was
a
most
active
magistrate
in
her
own
parish
,
the
minutest
concerns
of
which
were
carried
to
her
by
Mr
Collins
;
and
whenever
any
of
the
cottagers
were
dieto
be
quarrelsome
,
discontented
,
or
too
poor
,
she
tallied
forth
into
the
village
to
settle
their
differences
,
silence
their
complaints
,
and
scold
them
into
harmony
and
plenty
.
The
entertainment
of
dining
at
Ratings
was
repeated
about
twice
a
week
;
and
,
allowing
for
the
loss
of
Sir
William
,
and
there
being
only
one
card-table
in
the
evening
,
every
such
entertainment
was
the
counterpart
of
the
ﬁrst
.
Their
other
engagements
were
few
,
as
the
style
of
living
of
the
neighbourhood
in
general
was
beyond
the
Collinsea’
reach
.
This
,
however
,
was
no
evil
to
Elizabeth
,
and
upon
the
whole
she
spent
her
time
comfortably
enough
;
there
were
half-hours
of
pleasant
conversation
with
Charlotte
,
and
the
weather
was
so
ﬁne
for
the
time
of
ear
that
she
had
often
great
enjoyment

of
doors

was
along
the
open

which
edged
that

of

where
there
was
a

which
no

seemed
to
value

herself
,

felt

In

the

of

visit
soon
passed
away

had
heard
noon
after
her
arrival
that
Mr

was
expected
there
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
,
and
though
there
were
not
many
of
her
vauaintance
whom
she
did
not
prefer
,
his
coming
would
furnish
one
comparatively
new
to
look
at
in
their

parties
,
and
she
might
be
unused
in
seeing
how
hopeless
Miss
Bingley’s
designs
on
him
were
,
by
his
behavrour
to
his
cousin
,
for
whom
he
was
evidently
destined
by
Lady
Catherine
,
who
talked
of
his
coming
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
,
spoke
of
him
in
terms
of
the
highest
admindon
,
and
seemed
almost
an
ry
to
ﬁnd
that
.
he
had
already
been
frequently
seen
by
is
:
Lucas
and
herself
.
His
arrival
was
soon
known
at
the
Parsonage
;
for
Mr
Collins
was
walking
the
whole
morning
within
View
of
the
lodges
opening
into
Hunsford
Lane
,
in
order
to
have
the
nrlieet
assurance
of
it
,
and
after
making
his
bow
as
the
carriage
turned
into
the
Park
,
hurried
home
with
the
great
intelligence
.
On
the
following
morning
he
hastened
to
Rosings
to
ay
his
respects
.
There
were
two
nephews
of
Lady
atherine
to
uire
them
,
for
Mr
Darcy
had
brought
with
him
a

Fitzwilliam
,
the
younger
son
of
his
uncle
Lord

,
and
,
to
the
great
surprize
of
all
the
party
,
when
Mr
Collins
returned
,
the
gentlemen
accompanied
him
.
Charlotte
had
seen
them
from
her
husband’s
room
,
crossing
the
road
,
and
immediately
running
into
the
other
,
told
the
girls
what
an
honour
they
might
expect
,
adding
—

for

Elizabeth
had
scarcely
time
to
disclaim
all
right
to
the
compliment
,
before
their
approach
was
announced
by
the
door-bell
,
and
shortly
afterwards
the
three
gentlemen
entered
the
room
.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
,
who
led
the
way
,
was
about
thirty

handsome
,
but
in
n

address
most

looked
as
he
had
been
used
to
look
in

compliments
,
with
his
usual
reserve
,
to
Mrs
Collins
,
and
whatever
might
be
his
feelings
towards
her
friend
,
met
her
with
every
appearance
of
compoeure
.
Elizabeth
merely
curueyed
to
him
,
without
saying
a
word
.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
entered
into
conversation
directly
with
the
readiness
and
ease
of
a
well-bred
man
,
and
talked
v
pleasantly
;
but
his
cousin
,
after
having
addressed
eezlight
observation
on
the
house
and
garden
to
Mn
Collins
,
sat
for
some
time
without
spalting
to
anybody
.
At
length
,
however
,
his
civility
was
so
far
awakened
as
to
enquire
of
Elizabeth
after
the
health
of
her
family
.
She
answered
him
in
the
usual
way
,
and
,
after
a
moment’s
Pause
,
added
—
—
“
My
eldest
sister
has
been
in
town
these
three
months
.
Here
you
never
happened
to
see
her
there
?
”
She
was
perfectly
sensible
that
he
never
had
;
but
she
wished
to
see
whether
he
would
betray
any
consciousness
of
what
had
passed
between
the
Bin
leya
and
Jane
,
and
she
thought
he
looked
a
little
con

answered
that
he
had
never

fortunate

subject
was
pursued
no
farther

gentlemen

afterwards
went

were
very
much
admired
at
the
Parsonage

and
the

all
felt
that

pleasure

at

it
was
not
till
Easter-day

almost
a

after

gentlemen’s
arrival
,
that
they
were
honoured
by
such
an
attention

In

For
the
last
week
they
had
seen
very
little
of

Lady

her

Colonel
Fitzwilliam
had
called
at
the
Parsonage
more
than
once
during
the
time
,
but
Mr

they
had
only
seen
at

The

was
accepted

,
and
at
a
proper
hour
the
oined
the
party
in
Lady
Catherine’s
drawingroom
.
er
ladyship
received
them
civilly
,
but
it
was
plain
that
their
company
was
by
no
means
so
acceptable
as
when
she
could
get
nobody
else
;
and
she
was
,
in
fact
,
almost
engrossed
by
her
nephews
,
speaking
to
them
,
especially
to
Darcy
,
much
more
than
to
any
other
person
in
the
morn
.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
seemed
really
glad
to
see
them
;
an
thing
was
a
welcome
relief
to
him
at
Rosings
;
and
Collins’s
retty
friend
had
moreover
caught
his
fancy
very
muc
.
He
now
seated
himself
by
her
,
and
talked
so
agreeably
of
Kent
and
Hertfordshire
,
of
travelling
and
staying
at
home
,
of
new
books
and
music
,
that
Elizabeth
had
never
been
half
so
well
entertained
in

room
before
;
and
they
conversed
with
so
much
spirit
and
ﬂow
,
as
to
draw
the
attention
of

as
well
as
of

“I

’
said
Darcy
,
“if
he
were
to

it
up
as
soon
as

Elizabeth
made
no
answer
.
She
was
afraid
of
talliing
longer
of
his
friend
;
and
,
having
nothing
else
to
say
,
was
now
determined
to
leave
the
trouble
of
ﬁnding
a
subject
to
him
.
He
took
the
hint
,
and
soon
began
with
,
“
This
seems
a
very
comfortable
house

Lady
CItherine

“I

did
—
and
I
am
sure
she
could
not
have
bestowed
her
kindness
on

more
grateful
object
.
'
“
Mr
Collins
appears
very
fortunate
in
his
choice
of

“

As
he
spoke
there
was
a
sort
of
smile
which
Elizabeth
fancied
she
understood
;
he
muat
be

her
to

enced

he
drew
back
his

took
a

aper
from

,
and
,
glancing
over
it
,
said
,
in
a
co
der
voice
—
“
Are

?
”
A
short
dialogue
on
the
subject
of
the
county
ensued
,
on
either
side
calm
and
concise
—
and
soon
put
an
end
to
by
the
entrance
of
Charlotte
and
her
sister
,
just
returned
from
their
walk
.
The
Maui-m
:
surprized
them
.
Mr
Darcy
relach
the
mistake
which
had
occasioned
his
intruding
on
Miss
Bennet
,
and
after
sitting
a
few
minutes
longer
without
uying
much
to
anybody
,
went
awa
.
“yWhat
can
be
the
meaning
of
this
?
'
said
Charlotte
,
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
.
“
My
dear
Eliza
,
he
mun
be
in
love
with
you
,
or
he
would
never
have
called
on
us
in
this
familiar
way.”
But
when
Elizabeth
told
of
his
silence
,
it
did
not
seem
very
likely
,
even
to
Charlotte’s
wishes
,
to
be
the
case
;
and
after
various
conjectures
,
they
could
at
last
only
suppose
his
visit
to
proceed
from
the
difﬁculty
of
ﬁnding
anything
to
do
,
which
was
the
more
probable
from
the
time
of
year
.
All
ﬁeld
sports
were
over
.
Within
doors
there
was
Lady
Catherine
,
books
,
and
a
billiard-table
,
but
gentlemen
can
not
be
always
within
doors
;
and
in
the
nearness
of
the
Parsonage
,
or
the
pleasantness
of
the
walk
to
it
,
or
of
the
people
who
lived
in
it
,
the
two
cousins
found
a
temptation
from
this
rind
of
walking
thither
almost
every
day
.
They
callfd
at
various
times
of
the
morning
,
sometimes
separately
,
sometimes

twas
plain
to
them
all
that
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
came
because
he
had
pleasure
in
their
socict
,
a
persuasion
which
of
course
recommended
him
still
more
;
and
Elizabeth
was
reminded
by
her
own
satisfaction
in
being
with
him
,
as
well
as
by
his
evident
admiration
of
her
,
of
her
former

Fitzwilliam’l

she
believed
he
might
have

mind
.
But
why
Mr
Darcy
came
so
often
to
the
Parsonage
,
it
was
more
difﬁcult
to
understand
.
It
could
not
be
for
society
,
an
he
frequently
lat
there
ten
minutes
together
without
opening
his
lips
;
and
when
he
did
lpeak
,
it
aeerned
the
effect
of
neccuity
rather
than
of
choice
—
a
aacriﬁce
to
propriety
,
not
a
pleasure
to
himself
.
He
seldom
appeared
really
animated
.
Mrs
Collins
knew
not
what
to
make
of
him
.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam’s
occasionally
lan
hing
at
his
stupidity
,
proved
that
hr.was
generally
di

,
which
her
own
knowledge
of
him
could
not
have
told
her
i
and

would
have
liked
to
believe
this
change
the
eﬁ'ect
of
love
,
and
the
object
of
that
love
her
friend
Eliza
,
she
set
herself
serioualy
to
work
to
ﬁnd
it
out
.
She
watched
him
whenever
they
were
at
Roaings
,
and
whenever
he
came
to
Hunaford
;
but
without
much
success
.
He
certainly
looked
at
her
ﬁ-iend
a
great
deal
,
but
the
expression
of
that
look
was
disputable
.
It
was
an
earnest
,
steadfast
gaze
,
but
she
often
doubted
whether
there
were
much
admiration
in
it
,
and
sometimes
it
seemed
nothing
but
absence
of
mind
.
She
had
once
or
twice
suggested
to
Elizabeth
the
possibility
of
his
being
partial
to
her
,
but
Elizabeth
always
laughed
at
the
idea
;
and
Mrs
Collins
did
not
think
it
right
to
press
the
subject
,
from
the
danger
of
raising
expectations
which
might
only
end
in
disappointment
;
for
in
her
opinion
it
admitted
not
of
adouht
,
that
all
her
friend
s
dislike
would
vanish
,
if
she
could
suppose
him
to
be
in
her
power
.
n
her
kind
schemes
for
Elizabeth
,
she
sometimes
lanned
her
marrying
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
.
He
was

,
took
care
to
inform
him
at
ﬁrst
that
it
was
a
favourite
haunt
of
hers
.
How
it
could
occur
a
second
time
,
therefore
.
was
very
odd
!
Yet
it
did
,
and
even
the
third
.
It
seemed
like
wilful
ill-nature
,
or
a
voluntar
penance
,
for
on
these
occasions
it
was
not
merely
a
ew
formal
inquiries
and
an
awkward
pause
and
then
away
,
but
he
actually
thought
.
it
necessary
to
turn
back
and
walk
with
her
.
He
never
said
a
great
deal
,
nor
did
she
give
herself
the
trouble
of
talking
or
of
listening
much
;
but
it
struck
her
in
the
course
of
their
third
rencontre
that
he
was
asking
some
odd
unconnected
questions
—
about
her
pleasure
in
being
at
Hunsfnrd
,
her
love
of
solitary
walks
,
and
her
opinion
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Collins’s
happiness
;
and
that
in
speaking
of
Rosings
and
her
not
perfectly
understanding
the
house
,
he
seemed
to
expect
that
whenever
she
came
into
Kent
again
she
would
be
staying
that
too
.
His
words
seemed
to
imply
it
.
Could
he
have
Colonel
Fitzwilliaml
in
his
thoughts
?
She
supposed
,
if
he
meant
anything
,
he
must
mean
an
allusion
to
what
might
arise
in
that
uarter
.
It
distressed
her
a
little
,
and
she
was
quite
l
to
ﬁnd
herself
at
the
gate
in
the
pales
opposite
the
arsonage

She

that

,
Instead

surprized
by
Mr

,
she
saw
on

“I

he
replied
,
“as
I

they

“Do

said
she
.
“Yes

if

not

off
again

But
I
am
at

.
He
arranges
the
business
just

“And

he
has
at

I

more

Mr

“
He
likes
to

well

replied
Colonel
Fitzwillianl
.
“But
so
we
all
do

It

only
that

What

this

that

he
came
towards
her
in

manner

thus
began

lizabeth’s
astonishment
was
beyond
expression
.
She
stared
,
coloured
,
doubted
,
and
was
silent

This
he
considered
sufﬁcient
encouragement
;
and
the
avowal
of
all
that
he
felt

had
long

immediately
followed

He
spoke
Well

there

In
spite
of
her
deeply-rooted
dislike
,
she
could
not
be
insensible
to
the
compliment
of
such
a
man’s
affection
,
and
though
her
intentions
did
not
vary
for
an

,
she
was
at

sorry
for
the

She

He

but
his

Such
a

could
only
exasperam
farther
,
and
,
when
he
ceased
,
the
colour
rose
into
her
cheeks
,
and
she
said
—
,
“
In
such
cases
as
this
,
it
is
,
I
believe
,
the
established
mode
to
express
a
sense
of

for
the

returned
.
It
is
natural
that

should
be

if
I
could

gratitude
,
I
would
now
thank
you
.
But
I
can
not

I
have
never

and
you
have
certainly
bestowed
it
most

.
I
am
sorry
to
have
occasioned
pain
to
any
one
.
It
has
been
most
unconscioust

,
and
I

will
be
of

Darcy

who
was
leaning
against

with
his
eyes
ﬁxed
on
her
face
,
seemed
to
catch
her
words
with
no
less
resentment
than
surprize
.
His
complexion
became
pale
with

.
At
length
,
in
a
voice
of
forced
calmness
,
he
said
—
“

this

all
the
reply

I

“
I
might
as
well
inquire
,
”
replied
she
,
“
why
with
so
evident
a
design
of
offending
and

do
you
think
that
any
consideration
would
tempt
me
to
accept
the
man
who
has
been
the
means
of
ruining
,
perhaps
for
ever
,
the
happiness
of
a
most
beloved
sister
2
”
‘
As
she
pronounced
these
words
,
Mr
Darcy
changed
colour
;
but
the
emotion
was
short
,
and
he
listened
without
attempting
to
interrupt
her
while
she
continued
—
“I
have
every
reason
in
the
world
to
think
ill
of
you
.
No
motive
can
excuse
the
unjust
and
ungenerous
part
you
acted
(
bare
.
You
dare
not
,
you
can
not

that
you
have
been

not
the
only
means
of
dividing

exposing
one
to
the
censure

for
caprice

instability
,
the
other
to
its
derision

involving
them
both

;
She
paused
,
and
saw
with
no
slight
indignation
that
he
was
listening
with
an
air
which
proved
him
wholly
unmoved
by
any
feeling
of
remorse
.
He
even
looked
at
her
with
s
smile
of
affected
incredulity
.
“
Can
you
deny
that
you
have
done
it
?
”
she
repeated
.

With
assumed
tranquillity
he
then
replied
,
“
I

no

of

'
Elizabeth
disdained
the
appearance
of
noticing
this
civil
reﬂection
,
but
its
meaning
did
not
escape
,
nor
was
it
likely
to
conciliate
her
.
“
But
it
is
not
merely
this
Iﬂ'nir
,
”
she
continued
,
“
on
which
my
dislike
is
founded
.
Long
before
it
had
taken
place
my

Your
character
was
unfo

in
the
recital
which
I
received
many
months
ago
from
Mr
Wickham

On

you

you
here
impose
upon

“You
take
an
eager
interest
in
that
gentleman's
concerns
,
'
said
Darcy
,
in
a
less
tranquil
tone
,
and
with
a
hei
htened
colour
.
“
ho
that
knows
what
his
misfortunes
have
been
,
can
help
feeling
an
interest
in
him
?
'
“His
misfortunes
!
"
repealed
Darcy
cuntemptuously
;
“yes
,
his
misfortunes
have
been
great
indeed
.
'
"
And
of
your
inﬂiction
,
”
cried
Eliubeth
with
energy
.
“
You
hm
reduced
him
to
his
present
state
of
poverty
—
comparative
poverty
.
You
have
withheld
the
advantages
which
you
must
know
to
have
been
designed
for
him
.
You
have
deprived
the
best
years
of
his
life
of
that
independence
which
was
no
less
his
due
than
his
desert
.
You
have
done
all
this
!
and
yet
you
can
treat
the
mention
of
his
misfortunes
with
contempt
and
ridicule.”
“And
this
,
”
cried
Darcy
,
as
he
walked
with
uick
steps
across
the
room
,
“is
your
opinion

so
fully
.
My
faults

according

this
calculation

heavy
indeed
!
But
.
perhaps
,
'
added
he
,
stopping
in
his
walk
,
and
turnin
towards
her
.
“
these
offences
might
have
been
over
ooked
,
had
not
your
pride
been
hurt
by
my
honest
confession
of
the
scruples
that
had
long
prevented
my
forming
any
serious
design
.
These
bitter
accusations
might
.have
been
suppressed
,
had
I
,
with
greater
policy
,
concealed
my
strug
les
,
and
ﬂattered
you
into
the
belief
of
my
being
impeled
by
unqualiﬁed
,
unalloyed
inclination
;
by
reason
,
by
reﬂection
,
by
everything
.
But
disguise
of
every
sort
is
my
abhorrence
.
Nor
am
I
ashamed
of
the
feelings
I
related
.
They
were
natural
and
just
.
Could
you
expect
me
to
rejoice
in
the
inferiority
of
your
connections
i
—
w
congratulate
myself
on
the
ho
of
relations
,
whose
condition
in
life
is
so
decid
y
beneath
my
own
?
”
Elizabeth
felt
herself
growing
more
angry
every
moment
;
yet
she
tried
to
the
utmost
to
speak
with
com
ure
when
she
said
—
—
'
“
on
are
mistaken
,
Mr
Darcy
,
if
you
suppose
that
the
mode
of
your
declaration
affected
me
in
any
other
way
,
than
as
it
spared
me
the
concern
which
I
might
have
felt
in
refusing
you
,
had
you
behaved
in
a
more
gentlemanlike
manner
.
’
She
saw
him
start
at
this
,
but
he
said
nathing
,
and
she
continued
—
'
“
You
could
not
have
made
me
the
olfer
of
your
hand
in
any
possible
way
that
would
have
tempted
me
to
accept
it.”
Again
his
astonishment
was
obvious
;
and
he
looked
at
her
with
an
expression
of
mingled
incredulity
and
mortilication
.
She
went
on
—
“
From
the
very
beginning
—
from
the
ﬁrst
moment
,
I
my
almost

—
of
my

and
your

such
as
to

I

'
And
with
these
words
he
has
'
y
left
the
room
,
and
Elizabeth
heard
him
the
next
moment
open
the
front
door
and
quit
the
home
.
The
tumult
of
her
mind
was
now
painfully
great
.
She
knew
not
how
to
support
herself
,
and
from
actual
weakness
sat
down
and
cried
for
half-an-hour
.
Her
astonishment
,
as
she
reﬂected
on
what
had
passed
,
was
increased
by
every
review
of
it
.
That
she
should
receive
an
offer
of
man-iage
from
Mr
Darcy
!
that
he
should
have
been
in
love
with
her
for
so
many
months
!
—
-so
much
in
love
as
to
wish
to
marry
her
in
spite
of
all
the
objections
which
had
made
him
prevent
his
friend’s
marrying
her
sister
,
and
which
must
appear
at
least
with
uni
force
in
his
own
case
—
was
almost
incrediblel
—
It
was
gratif
ing
to
have
inspired
unconsciously
so
strong
an
a
non
.
But
his
pride
,
his
abominable
pride
—
his
ulnmeless
avowal
of
what
he
had
done
with
respect
to
Jane
—
his
unpardonahle
assurance
in
acknowledging
,
though
he
could
not
justify
it
,
and
the
unfeeling
manner
in
which
he
had
mentioned
Mr
Wickham
,
his
cruelty
towards
whom
he
had
not
attem
ted
to
deny
,
soon
overcame
the
ity
which
the
conli
emion
of
his
attachment
had
ihr
a
moment
excited
.
She
continued
in
very
agitating
reﬂections

till
the
sound
of
Lady
Catherine’s
carriage
made

.
LIZABETH
awoke
the
next
morning
to
the
same
thoughts
and
meditations
which
had
at
length
closed
her
eyes
.
She
could
not
yet
recover
from
the
surprize
of
what
had
happened
;
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
anything
else
;
and
,
totally
indisposed
for
employment
,
she
resolved
,
soon
after
breakfast
,
to
indulge
herself
in
air
and
exercise
.
She
was
)
roeeeding
directly
to
her
favourite
walk
,
when
the
recolection
of
Mr
Darcy’s
sometimes
coming
there
stopped
her
,
and
instead
of
entering
the
park
,
she
turned
up
the
lane
,
which
led
her
farther
from
the
tumpike-road
.
The
park
paling
was
still
the
boundary
on
one
side
,
and
she
soon
passed
one
of
the
gates
into
the
ground
.
After
walking
two
or
three
times
along
that
part
of
the
lane
,
she
was
tempted
,
by
the
leasantness
of
the
morning
,
to
stop
at
the
gates
and
00k
into
the
rk
.
The
ﬁve
weeks
which
she
had
now
passed
in
ent
had
made
a
great
diil'erence
in
the
country
,
and
every
day
was
adding
to
the
verdure
of
the
early
trees
.
She
was
on
the
point
of
continuing
her
walk
,
when
she
caught
a
glim
se
of
a
gentleman
within
the
sort
of
grove
which
ged
the
park
;
he
was
moving
that
way
;
and
,
fearful
of
its
being
Mr
Darcy
,
she
was
directly
retreating
.
But
the
person
who
advanced
was
now
near
enough
to
see
her
,
and
steppin
forward
with
eagerness
,
pronounced
her
name
.
he
had
med
away
;
but
on
hearing
herself

voice

which
proved
it
to
be
Mr
Darcy
,
she
moved
again
towards
the
ate
.
He
had
by
that
time
reached
it
also
,
and
,
hol
ing
out
a
letter
,
which
she
instinctively
took
,
said
,
with
a
look
of
haughty
composure
,
“I
have
been
walking
in
the
grove
some
time
in
the
hope
of
meeting
you
.
Will
you
do
me
the
honour
of
reading
that
.
letter
?
”
And
then
,
with
a
slight
how
,
turned
again
into
the
plantation
,
and
was
soon
out
of
sight
.
With
no
expectation
of
pleasure
,
but
with
the
strongest
curiosity
,
Eliubeth
opened
the
letter
,
and
,
to
her
still-increasing
wonder
,
perceived
an
enveio
containing
two
sheets
of
letter-paper
,
written
quite
through
,
in
a
very
close
hand
.
The
envelope
itself
was
likewise
full
.
Pursuing
her
way
along
the
lane
,
she
then
began
it
.
It
was
dated
from
Rosings
,
at
eight
o’clock
in
the
morning
,
and
was
as
follows
:
—
“

of

was
last

so

bestowed

respecting

ho
to

,
when
the

account
0
my
actions
and
their
motives
has
been
read
.
If
,
in
the
explanation
of
them
,
which
is
due
to
myself
,
I
am
under
the
necessity
of
relating
feelings
which
may
be
offensive
to
yours
,
I
can
only
say
that
I
am
sorry
.
The
necessity
must
be
obeyed
,
and
further
apology
would
be
absurd
.
“I
had
not
been
long
in
Hertfordshire
,
before
I
saw
,
in
common
with
others
,
that
Dingley
preferred
your
elder
sister
to
any
other
young
woman
in
the
country
.
But
it
was
not
till
the
evening
of
the
dance
at
Netherﬁeld
that
I
had
any
ap
rehension
of
his
feeling
a
serious
attachment
.
I
had
0
ten
seen
him
in
love
before
.
At
that
ball
,
while
I
had
the
honour
of
dancing
with
you
,
I
was
first
made
acquainted
,
by
Sir
William
Lucas’s
accidental
information
,
that
Bingley’s
attentions
to
your
sister
had
given
rise
to
a
general
expectation
of
their
maninge
.
He
spoke
of
it
as
a
certain
event
,
of
which
the
time
alone
could
be
undecided
.
From
that
moment
I
observed
my
friend’s
behaviour‘attentively
;
and
I
could
then
perceive
that
his
paru'ality
for
Miss
Beonet
was
be
and
what
I
had
ever
witnessed
in
him
.
Your
sister
also
watched
.
Her
look
and
manners
were
open
,
cheerful
,
and
engaging
as
ever
,
but
without
any
symptom
of
peculiar
regard
,
and
I
remained

from
the
evening’s
scnitiny
,
that
though
she
received
his
attentions
with
pleasure
,
she
did
not
invite
them
by
any
participation

.
If
you
have
not
been
minaken
here
,
I
must
have
been
in
an
error
.
Your
superior
knowled
e
of
your
sister
must
make
the
latter
probable
.
—
If
it
so
,
if
I
have
been
misled
by
such
error
to
inﬂict
pain
on
her
,
your
resentment
has
not
been
unreasonable
.
But
I
shall
not
scruple
to
assert
,
that
the
serenity
of
your
sister’s
countenance
and
air
was
such
as
might
have
given
the
most
acute
observer
1
:
conviction
that
,
however
amiable
her
temper
,
her
heart
was
not
likely
to
be
easily
touched
.
That
I
was
desirous
of
believing
her
indifferent
is
certain
—
but
I
will
venture
to
say
that
my
investigations
and
decisions
are
not
usually
inﬂuenced
by
my
hopes
or
fears
.
I
did
not
believe
her
to
be
indifferent
because
I
wished
it
;
—
I
believed
it
on
impartial
conviction
,
as
truly
as
I
wished
it
in
reason
.
My
ob'ections
to
the
marriage
were
not
merely
those
which
last
night
acknowledged
to
have
required
the
utmost
fame
of
passion
to
put
aside
,
in
my
own
case
;
the
want
of
connection
could
not
be
so
great
an
evil
to
my
friend
as
to
me
.
But
there
were
other
causes
of
repugnnnce
;
—
causes
which
,
though
still
exisn'ng
,
and
existing
to
an

generally
bestowed
on
you
and
your
eldest
sister
,
than
it
is
honourable
to
the
sense
and
dispolition
of
both
.
I
will
only
say
farther
that
from
what
passed
that
evening
,
my
opinion
of
all
parties
was
conﬁrmed
,
and
every
inducement
heightened
which
could
have
led
me
before
to
preserve
my
friend
from
what
I
esteemed
a
most
unhappy
connection
.
He
left
Netherﬁeld
for
London
,
on
the
day
following
,
as
you
,
I
am
certain
,
remember
,
with
the
design
of
soon
returning
.
“The
tart
which
I
acted
is
now
to
be
explained
.
His
sisters
uneasiness
had
been
equally
excited
with
my
own
;
our
coincidence
of
feeling
was
soon
discovered
,
and
,
alike
sensible
that
no
time
was
to
be
lost
in
detaching
their
brother
,
we
shortly
resolved
on
joining
him
directly
in
London
.
We
accordingly
went
—
and
there
I
readily
engaged
in
the
ofﬁce
of
pointing
out
to
my
friend
the
certain
evils
of
such
a
choice
.
I
described
,
and
enforced
them
eameatly
.
But1
however
this
temonstrance
might
have
staggered
or
delayed
his
determination
,
I
do
not
suppose
that
it
would
ultimately
have
prevented
the
marriage
,
had
it
not
been
seconded
by
the
assurance
which
I
hesitated
not
in
giving
,
of
your
sister’s
indifference
.
He
had
before
believed
her
to
return
his
affection
with
sincere
,
if
not
with
equal
regard
.
But
Bingley
has
great
natural
modesty
,
with
a
stronger
dependence
on
my
judgment
than
on
his
own
.
To
convince
him
,
therefore
,
that
he
had
deceived
himself
,
was
no
very
diﬂicult
point
.
To
persuade
him
against
returning
into
Henfordshire
,
when
that
conviction
had
been
given
,
was
scarcely
the
work
of
a
moment
.
I
can
not
blame
myself
for
having
done
thus
much
.
There
is
but
one
part
of
my
conduct
in
the
whole
affair
on
which
I
do
not
reﬂect
with
satisfaction
;
it
is
,
that
I
condescended
to
adopt
the
measures
of
art
no
far
as
to
conceal
from
him
your
sister’s
bein
in
town
.
I
knew
it
myself
,
as
it
was
known
to
Miss

;
but
her
brother

That

might

perhaps
probable
;
but
his

not
appear
to
me
enough

him
to
see

Perhaps
this
concealment
,
this

was
beneath
me
;
it

however
,

it
was
done
for
the
best
—
On
this
subjectl
have
nothing
more
to
say
,
no
other
apology
to
olfer
.
If
I
have
wounded
your
sister’s
feelings
,
it
was
unknowingly
done
'
;
and
though
the
motives
which
governed
me
my
to
you
very
naturally
appear
insufﬁcient
,
I
have
not

learnt
to
condemn
them
.
“
With
respect
to
that
other
,
more
weighty
accusation
,
of
havin
injured
Mr
Wickham
,
I
can
only
refute
it
by
laying
fore
on
the
whole
of
his
connection
with
my
family
.
0
what
he
has
titularly
accused
me
I
am
ignorant
;
but
of
the
tru
of
what
I
shall
relate
,
I
can
summon
more
than
one
witness
of
undoubted
veracit
.
“
r
Wickham
is
the
son
of
a
very
respectable
man
,
who
had
for
many
years
the
management
of
all
the
Pemberle
estates
,
and
whose
good
conduct
in
the
discharge
0
his
tmst
naturally
inclined
my
father
to
be
of
service
to
him
;
and
on
George
Wicklmm
,
who
was
his
godson
,
his
kindness
was
therefore
liberall
bestowed
.
My
father
supported
him
at
school
,
and
wards
at
Cambridge
,
—
-most

assistance
,
as
his
own
father
,
always
poor
from
the
extravagance
of
his
wife
,
would
have
been
unable
to
give
him
a
gentleman’s
education
.
My
father
was
not

fond
of
this
young
man's
society
,
whose
manners
were
always
engaging
;
he
had
also

,
and
hoping

to

it
.
As
for
myself
,
it
is
many
,
many
years
since
I
ﬁrst
began
to
think
of
him
in
a
very
different

But

has
created
,
a
suspicion
of
their
nature
shall
not
revent
me
from
unfolding
his
real
character~it
a
ds
even
another
motive
.
“
My
excellent
father
died
about
live
years
ago
;
and
his
attachment
to
Mr
Wickham
was
to
the
lat
so
steady
,
that
in
his
will
he
particularly
recommended
it
to
me
,
to
promote
his
advancement
in
the
best
manner
that
his
p‘roﬁrssion
might
allow
—
and
if
he
took
orders
,
desired
that
a
valuable
family
living
might
be
his
as
soon
as
it
became
vacant
.
There
was
also
a
lcgnc
of
one
thousand
pounds
.
His
own
father
did
not
ong
survive
mine
,
and
within
half
a
year
from
these
events
Mr
Wickham
wrote
to
inform
me
that
,
having
ﬁnally
resolved
against
taking
orders
,
he
hoped
I
should
not
.
think
it
unreasonable
for
him
to
expect
some
more
unmediate
pecunia
advantage
,
in
lieu
of
the
perferment
,
by
which
he
co
d
not
be
beneﬁted
.
He
had
some
intention
,
he
added
,
of
stud
ng
the
law
,
and
I
must
be
aware
that
the
interest
0
one
thousand
pounds
would
be
a
very
insuﬂicient
support
therein
.
I
rather
wished
,
than
believed
him
to
be
sincere
—
hut
,
at
any
rate
,
was
perfectly
ready
to
accede
to
his
proposal
.
I
knew
that
Mr
Wickham
ought
not
to
be
a
clergyman
;
the
business
was
therefore
soon
settled
—
he
resigned
all
claim
to
assistance
in
the
church
,
were
it
possible
that
he
could
ever
be
in
a
situation
to
receive
it
,
and
accepted
in
return
three
thousand
pounds
.
All
connection
between
us
seemed
now
dissolved
.
I
thought
too
ill
of
him
to
invite
him
to
Pemberley
,
or
admit
his
society
in
town
.
In
town
I
believe
he
chieﬂy
lived
,
but
his

studying
the
law
was
a
mere
pretence
,
and
being
now
free
from
all
restraint
,
his
life
was
a
life
of
idleness
and
dissipation
.
For
about
three
years
I
heard
little
of
him
;
but
on
the
deeease
of
the
incumbent
of
the
living
which
had
been
designed
for
him
,
he
applied
to
me
again
by
letter
for
the
presentation
.
His
circumstances
,
he
assured
me
,
and
1
had
no
diﬂicult
in
believing
it
,
were
exceedingly
bad
.
He
had
than
the
law
a
most
unprofitable
study
,
and
was
now
absolutely
resolved
on
being
ordained
,
if
I
would
present
him
to
the
living
in
uestion
—
of
which
he
trusted
there
could
be
little
oubt
,
as
he
was
well
assured
that
I
had
no
other
person
to
provide
for
,
and
I
could
not
have
forgotten
my
revered
father
s
intentions
.
You
will
hardly
blame
me
for
refusing
to
comply
with
this
entreaty
,
or
for
resisting
every
repetition
of
it
.
His
resentment
was
in
proportion
to
the
distress
of
his
circumstances
—
and
he
was
doubtless
as
violent
in
his
abuse
of
me
so
others
as
in
his
reproaches
to
myself
.
After
this
n'od
every
appearance
of
acquaintance
was
droppetfe
How
he
lived
I
know
not
.
But
last
summer
he
was
again
most
painfully
obtnlded
on
my
notice
.
“I
must
now
mention
a
circumstance
which
I
would
wish
to
forget
myself
,
and
which
no
obligation
less
than
the
present
should
induce
me
to
unfold
to
any
human
being
.
Having
said
thus
much
,
I
feel
no

of
your
secrecy

and

the
lady
who
presided
over
it
,
to
Ramsgate
;
and
thither
also
went
Mr
Wickham
,
undoubtedly
by
design
;
for
there
proved
to
have
been
a
prior
acquaintance
between
him
and
Mrs

whose
character

were

nivance

he
so
far
recommended
himself
to
Georgiana
,
whose
affectionate
heart
retained
a
strong
impression
of
his
kindness
to
her
as
a
child
,
that
she
was
persuaded
to
believe
herself
in
love
,
and
to
consent
to
an
elopernent
.
She
was
then
but
ﬁfteen
,
which
must
be
her
excuse
;
and
after
stating
her
imprudenoe
,
I
am
happ
to
add
,
that
I
owed
the
knowledge
of
it

herself
.

of

almost
looked

to

acknowledged
the
whole
to
me

§ou
may
imagine
what
I
felt
and
howI
acted

Regard
for
my
sister’s
credit
and
feelings
prevented
any
public
exposure
;
but
I
wrote
to
Mr
Wickham
,
who
left
the
place
immediately
,
and
Mrs
Younge
was
of
course
removed
from
her
charge
.
Mr
Wickham’s
chief
object
was
unquestionably
my
sister’s
fortune
,
which
is
thirty
thousand
pounds
;
but
I
can
not
help
supposing
that
the
hope
of
revenging
himself
on
me
was
a
strong
inducement
.
His
revenge
would
have
been
complete
indeed

F
Elizabeth
,
when
Mr
Darcy
gave
her
the
letter
,
I
did
not
expect
it
to
contain
a
renewal
of
his
offers
,
she
had
formed
no
expectation
at
all
of
its
contents
.
But
such
as
they
were
,
it
may
be
well
supposed
how
eagerly
she
went
through
them
,
and
what
a
contrariety
of
emotion
they
excited
.
Her
feelings
as
she
read
were
scarcely
to
be
defined
.
With
amazement
did
she
ﬁrst
understand
that
he
believed
any
apology
to
be
in
his
“power
;
and
steadfastly
was
she
persuaded
,
that
he
on
d
have
no
explanation
to
ive
,
which
a
sense
of
shame
would
not
cone
.
With
a
strong
prejudice
against
everything
he
might
say
,
she
began
his
account
of
what
had
happened
at
Netherﬁeld
.
She
read
with
an
eagerness
which
hardly
left
her
power
of
comprehension
;
and
from
impatience
of
knowmg
what
the
next
sentence
might
bring
,
was
incapable
of
attending
to
the
sense
of
the
one
before
her
eyes
.
His
belief
of
her
sister
s
insensibilit
she
instantly
resolved
to
be
false
;
and
his
account
0
the
real
,
the

[

AND
PREJUDICE
.
to
the
match
,
made
her
too
angry
to
have
any
with
of
doing
him
justice
.
He
expressed
no
regret
for
what
he
had
done
which
satisﬁed
her
;
his
style
was
not
penitent
,
but
haughty
.
It
was
all
pride
and
insolence
.
But
when
this
subject
was
succeeded
by
his
account
of
Mr
Wickham
,
—
when
she
read
with
somewhat
clearer
attention
a
relation
of
events
which
,
if
true
,
mutt
overthrow
eve
cherished
opinion
of
his
worth
,
and
which
bore
so
a
rming
an
afﬁnity
to
his
own
history
of
himselﬁ
—
her
feelin
s
were
yet
more
acutely
painful
and
more
diﬂicult
of
deﬁnition
.
Astonishment
,
apprehension
,
and
even
horror
,
oppressed
her
.
She
wished
to
discredit
it
entirely
,
repeatedly
exolaiming
,
“
This
must
be
falsel
This
can
not
be
!
This
must
be
the
grossest
falsehood
!
"
—
and
when
she
had
gone
through
the
whole
letter
,
though
scarcely
knowing
anything
of
the
last
page
or
two
,
put
it
hastily
away
,
protesting
that
she
would
not
regard
it
,
that
the
would
never
look
in
it
again
.
In
this
perturbed
state
of
mind
,
with
thoughts
that
could
rest
on
nothing
,
she
walked
on
;
but
it
would
not
do
;
in
half
a
minute
the
letter
was
unfolded
again
,
and
collecting
herself
as
well
as
she
could
,
she
again
began
the
mortifying
perusal
of
all
that
related
to
Wickham
,
and
commanded
herself
to
far
as
to
examine
the
meaning
of
eve
sentence
.
The
account
of
his
connection
with
the
emberley
family
was
exactly
what
he
had
related
himself
;
and
the
kindness
of
the
late
Mr
Darcy
,
though
she
had
not
before
known
its
extent
,
agreed
equally
well
with
his
own
words
.
So
far
each
recital
confirmed
the
other
;
but
when
she
came
to
the
will
,
the
difference
was
great
.
What
Wickham
had
said
of
the
liﬁng
was
fresh
in
her
memory
,
and
as
she
recalled
his
very
words
,
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
that
there
was
gross
duplicity
on
one
side
or
the
other
;
and
,
for
a
few
moments
,
the
ﬂattered
herself
that
her
wishes
did
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.
23
not
err
.
But
when
she
read
and
re-read
with
the
closest
mention
,
the
particulars
immediately
following
of
Wickham’s
resigning
all
pretensions
to
the
living
,
of
his
receiving
in
lieu
so
considerable
a
sum
ll
three
thousand
pounds
,
again
was
the
forced
to
heitate
.
She
put
down
the
letter
,
weighed
every
circumstance
with
what
she
meant
to
be
impartiality
—
deliberated
on
the
probability
of
each
tenement
—
but
with
little
success
.
On
both
sides
it
was
only
assertion
.
A
n
she
read
on
;
but
every
line
proved
more
clearly
the
aﬁ'air
,
which
she
had
believed
it
im
ble
that
any
contrivance
could
to
represent
as
to
rang-Mr
Darcy
s
conduct
in
it
less
than
infamous
,
was
capable
of
a
urn
which
must
make
him
entirely
blameless
throughout
die
whole
.
The
extravagance
and
gevneral
pmﬂigacy
which
he
scrupled
not
to
lay
to
Mr
icltham’s
char
,
exceedingly
shocked
her
;
the
more
so
,
as
she
to
1
!
bring
no
roof
of
its
injustice
.
She
had
never
heard
of
him
fore
his
entrance
into
the
—
shire
Militia
,
in
which
he
had
engaged
at
the
yersuasion
of
the
young
man
who
,
on
meeting
him
accidentally
in
town
,
had
there
renewed
a
slight
acquaintance
.
Of
his
former
way
of
life
nothing
had
been
known
in
Hertfardshire
but
what
he
told
himself
.
As
to
his
real
character
,
had
information
been
in
her
power
,
she
had
never
felt
a
wish
of
in
uiring
.
His
countenance
,
voice
,
and
manner
had
estab
ished
him
at
once
in
the
possession
of
every
virtue
.
She
tried
to
mollcct
some
instance
of
goodness
,
some
distinguished
trait
of
integrity
or
benevolence
,
that
might
rescue
him
from
the
attacks
of
Mr
Darcy
;
or
at
least
,
by
the
predominance
of
virtue
,
atone
for
those
casual
errors
under
which
she
would
endeavour
to
class
what
Mr
Darcy
had
described
as
the
idleness
and
vice
of
many
years
conﬂnuance
.
But
no
such
recollection
befriended
her
.
She
could

At

,
but
the
idea
was
checked
by
the
awkwardness

and
at

wholly
banished
by
the
conviction
that
Mr

would
never
have
haurded
such
a
proposal
,
if
he
had
not
been
well
auured
of
his
courin’l
corroboration
.
She
perfectly
remembered
everything
that
had
in
conversation
between
Wickham
and
hem”
,
in
their
ﬁrst
evening
at
Mr
Phillipa'a
.
Many
of
his
expreaaioru
were
atill
fresh
in
her
memory
.
She
wan
new
muck
with
the
impropriety
of
Inch
communication
:
to
a
stranger
,
and
wondered
it
had
etcaped
her
before
.
She
law
the
indelicacy
of
putting
himself
forward
as
he
had
done
,
and
the
inconliwency
of
his
profession
:
with
hie
conduct
.
She
remembered
that
he
had
boasted
of
having
no
fear
of
|eeing
Mr
Darcy
—
that
Mr
Darcy
might
leave
the
country
,
but
that
be
should
stand
his
ground
:
yet
he
had
avoided
the
Netherﬁeld
ball
the
very
next
week
.
She
remembered
also
that
,
till
the
Netherlield
family
had
quitted
the
cbuntry
,
he
had
told
his
nary
to
no
one
but
herself
;
but
that
after
their
removal
it
had
been
everywhere
discussed
;
that
he
had
then
no
reIervet
,
no
temples
in
linking
Mr
Darcy’s
character
,
PRIDE
AND

.
25
thou
h
he
had
assured
her
that
re
ct
for
the
father
wou
d
always
prevent
his
exposing
e
son
.
How
differently
did
everything
now
a
pear
in
which
he
was
concerned
I
His
attentions
to
bliss
King
were
now
the
consequence
of
views
solely
and
hatefully
mercenary
;
and
the
mediocrity
of
her
fortune
proved
no
longer
the
moderation
of
his
wishes
,
but
his
eagemeu
lo
grup
at
anything
.
His
behaviour
to
herself
could
now
have
had
no
tolerable
motive
;
he
had
either
been
deceived
with
regard
to
her
fortune
,
or
had
been
gratifying
his
vanity
by
encouraging
the
preference
which
she
believed
s
2
had
mom
incautioully
shown
.
Everylin
ering

in
his
favour
grew
fainter
and
fainter
;
an
in
farther
uttiﬁcation
of
Mr
Darcy
,
she
could
not
but
allow
that
Mi
Bingley
,
when
queationed
by
Jane
,
had
1011
ago
asserted
his
blarnelessness
in
the
affair
;
that
pron
and
repulsive
as
were
his
manners
,
she
had
never
,
in
the
whole
course
of
their
acquaintance
—
an
acquaintance
which
had
latterly
brought
them
much
together
,
and
given
her
a
sort
of
intimacy
with
his
waye-eeen
anything
that
betrayed
him
to
be
unprincipled
or
unjust
—
anything
that
spoke
him
of
irreligioue
or
immoral
habits
:
that
among
his
own
connections
he
wan
esteemed
and
valued
—
that
even
Wickham
had
allowed
him
merit
as
abrother
,
and
that
she
had
often
heard
him
speak
so
affectionate
]
of
his
sister
as
to
prove
him
capable
of
some
amiabe
feeling
;
that
had
hit
actions
been
what
Wickham
represented
them
,
so
gross
a
violation
of
everything
right
could
hardly
have
been
concealed
from
the
world
;
and
that
friendship
between
a
person
capable
of
it
,
and
such
an
amiable
man
as
Mr
Bingley
,
was
incomprehensible
.
She
grew
absolutely
ashamed
of
herself
.
Of
neither
Darcy
nor
Wickharn
could
she
think
without
feeling
that
she
had
been
blind
,
partial
,
prejudiced
,
absurd

a
message
from
her

,
importing
that
she
felt
herself
so
dull
as
to
make
her
very
desirous
of
having
them
all
to
dine
with
her
.
Iizabeth
could
not
see
Lady
Catherine
without
recollecting
that
,
had
she
chosen
it
,
she
might
by
this
time
have
been
presented
to
her
as
her
future
niece
;
nor
could
she
think
,
without
a
smile
,
of
what
her
lady-r
ship’s
indignation
would
have
been
.
“What
would
she
have
said
i
—
how
would
she
have
behaved
?
'
were
questions
with
which
she
amused
hersele
Their
first
subject
was
the
diminution
of
the
Rosings
arty
.
“I
assure
on
,
I
feel
it
exceedingly
,
'
said
Eddy
Catherine
;
“
believe
nobody
feels
the
loss
of
friends
so
much
as
I
do
.
But
I
am
particularly
attached
to
these
young
men
,
and
know
them
to
be
so
much
attached
to
mel
—
They
were
excessively
to
go
!
But
so
they
always
are
.
The
dear
colonel
rallied
his
spirits
tolerably
till
just
at
last
;
but
Darcy
seemed
to
feel
it
most
acutely
,
more
,
I
think
,
than
last
year
.
His
attachment
to
Rosings
certainly
increases.”
Mr
Collins
had
a
compliment
,
and
an
allusion
to
throw
in
here
,
which
were
kindly
smiled
on
by
the
mother
and
daughter
.
Lady
Catherine
observed
,
after
dinner
,
that
Miss
Bennet
seemed
out
of
spirits
,
and
immediately
accounting
for
it
herself
,
by
supposing
that
she
did
not
like
to
go
home
again
so
soon
,
she
added
—
“
But
if
that
is
the
case
,
you
must
write
to
your
mother
to
beg
that
you
may
stay
a
little
longer
.
Mrs
Collins
will
be
very
glad
of
your
company
,
I
am
sure.”
“

replied
Elizabeth
,
“but

'
“Why
,
at
that

,
you
will
have
been

only
six

.
I
expected
you

I

there

“You

madam
;
but
I
believe

must

by
our
original
plan
.
'
Lady
Catherine
seemed
resigned
.
“
Mrs
Collins
,
you
must
send
a
servant
with

.
You
know
I
always
speak
my

I
can
not

idea
of

It

You

I
have
the

manners
so
far
from
right
herself
,
was
entirely
insensible
of
the
evil
.
Elizabeth
had
frequently
united
with
Jane
in
an
endeavour
to
check
the
imprudence
of
Catherine
and
Lydia
;
but
while
they
were
supported
by
their
mother
s
indulgence
,
what
chance
could
there
be
of
improvement
?
Catherine
,
weak-minted
,
irritable
,
and
completely
under
Lydis’s
guidance
,
had
been
always
aﬁ‘ronted
by
their
advice
;
and
Lydia
,
self-willed
and
careless
,
would
scarcaly
give
them
a
hearing
.
They
were
ignorant
,
idle
,
and
vain
.
While
there
was
an
ofﬁcer
in
Meryton
,
they
would
ﬂirt
with
him
;
and
while
Meryton
was
within
a
walk
of
Longboum
,
they
would
be
going
there
for
ever
.
Anxiety
on
Jane’s
behalf
was
another
prevailing
concern
;
and
Mr
Darcy’s
explanation
,
by
restoring
Bingley
to
all
her
former
good
opinion
,
heightened
the
sense
of
what
Jane
had
lost
.
His
ali'ection
was
proved
to
have
been
sincere
,
and
his
conduct
cleared
of
all
blame
,
unless
any
could
attach
to
the
implicitness
of
his
conﬁdence
in
his
friend
.
How
grievous
then
was
the
thought
that
,
of
a
situation
so
desirable
in
every
respect
,
so
replete
with
advantage
,
so
promising
for
ha
piness
,
Jane
had
been
deprived
,
by
the
folly
and
in
ecorum
of
her
own
family
!
When
to
these
recollections
was
added
the
development
of
Wiekham
s
character
,
it
may
be
easily
believed
that
the
happy
spirits
which
had
seldom
been
depressed
before
,
were
now
so
much
affected
as
to
make
it

engagements
at
Rosings
were
as
frequent
during
the
last

of

as

The
very

was
spent
there
;

her

again
inquired
minume
into
the
particulars
of

,

them

Saturday
morning
Elizabeth
and
Mr
Collins
met
for
breakfast
a
few
minutes
before
the
others
appeared
;
and
he
took
the
opportunity
of
paying
the
parting
civilities
which
he
deemed
indispensany
necessary
.
“I
know
not
,
Miss
Elizabeth
,
'
said
he
,
“whether
Mrs
Collins
has
yet
expressed
her
sense
of
your
kindness
in
coming
to
us
;
but
I
am
very
certain
you
will
not
leave
the
house
without
receiving
her
thanks
for
it
.
The
favour
of
your
company
has
been
much
felt
,
I
assure
you
.
We
know
how
little
there
is
to
tempt
any
one
to
our
humble
abode
.
Our
plain
manner
of
living
,
our
small
rooms
and
few
domestics
,
and
the
little
we
see
of
the
world
,
must
make
Hunsford
extremely
dull
to
a
young
lady
like
yourself
;
but
I
hope
you
vnll
believe
us
grateful
for
the
condescension
,
and
that
we
have
done
everything
in
our
power
to
prevent
your
spending
your
time
unpleasantly.”
Elizabeth
was
eager
with
her
thanks
and
assurances
of
happiness
.
She
had
spent
six
weeks
with
great
enjoyment
;
and
the
pleasure
of
being
with
Charlotte
,
and
the
kind
attentions
she
had
received
,
must
make
her
feel
the
obliged
.
Mr

was
gratiﬁed
,

smiling
solemnity

I
thin

You

In

I
must

with

disadvantages

I
should
not

Words
were
insufficient
for
the
elevation
of
his
feelings
;
and
he
was
obliged
to
walk
about
the
room
,
while
Elizabeth
tried
to
unite
civility
and
truth
in
a
few
short
sentences
.
“

”
Their
.
journey
was
performed
without
much
conversation
,
or
any
alarm
;
and
within
four
hours
of
their
leaving
Hunsford
they
reached
Mr
Gardiner
s
house
,
where
they
were
to
remain
a
few
days
.
Jane
looked
well
,
and
Elizabeth
had
little
opportunity
of
studying
her
spirits
,
amidst
the
various
engagements
which
the
kindness
of
her
aunt
had
reserved
for
them
.
But
Jane
was
to
go
home
with
her
,
and
at
Longbourn
there
would
be
leisure
enough
for
observation
.
It
was
not
without
an
etTort
,
mean
while
,
that
she
could
wait
even
for
Longbourn
,
before
she
told
her
sister
of
Mr
Darcy’s
ropcmls
.
To
know
that
she
had
the
power
of
revea
ing
what
would
so
exceedingly
astonish
Jane
,
and
must
,
at
the
same
time
,
so
highly
gratify
whatever
of
her
own
vanity
she
had
not
yet
been
able
to
reason
away
,
was
such
a
temptation
to
0
etc
as
nothing
could
have
conquered
but
the
state
0
indecision
in
which
she
remained
as
to
the
extent
of
what
she
would
communicate
;
and
her
fear
,
if
she
once
entered
on
the
subject
,
of
being
hurried
into
repeating
something
of
Bingley
which
might
only
grieve
her

Jane

looked
at
each

the

was
told
that

laughed

“
She

“

“

Dear

we
had
such
a
good
piece
of
fun
the
other

at
Colonel
Forster’s
.
Kitty
and
me
were
to
spend
the
day
there
,
and
Mrs

romised
to
have
a
little
dance
in
the
evening
;
(

so
she
asked

ill
,
and
so

was
forced
to

We

for
we
were
forced
to
borrow

of

When
Denny

they

so
did
Mrs

.
I
thought
Ishould
have

And
[
but
made

suspect
something
,
and
then
they
soon
found
out
what
was
the
matter

of

jokes
,
did
Lydia
,
assisted
by
Kitty’s
hints
and
additions
,
endeavour
to
amuse
her
companions
all
the
way
to
Longbourn
.
Elizabeth
listened
as
little
as
she
could
,
but
there
was
no
escaping
the
frequent
mention
of
Wickham’s
name
.
Their
reception
at
home
was
most
kind
.
Mrs
Bennet
rejoiced
to
see
June
in
undiminished
bmuty
;
and
more
than
once
during
dinner
did
Mr
Bennet
say
voluntarily
to
Elizabeth
—
“I
am
glad
you
are
come
back
,
Lizzy.”
Their
party
in
the
dining-room
was
large
,
for
almost
all
the
Lueues
came
to
meet
Maria
and
hear
the
news
;
nnd
various
were
the
subjects
which
occupied
them
:
Lady
Lucas
was
in
uiring
of
Maria
,
across
the
table
,
after
the
welfare
an
poultry
of
her
eldest
daughter
;
Mrs
Bennet
was
doubly
engaged
.
on
one
hand
collecting
an
account
of
the
present
fashions
from
Jane
,
who
eat
some
way
below
her
,
and
,
on
the
other
,
retailing
them
all
to
the
younger
Miss
Lucnses
;
and
Lydia
,
in
a
voice
rather
louder
than
any
other
person’s
,
was
enumerating
the
various
pleasures
of
the
morning
to
anybody
who
would
hear
her
.
“
Oh
!
Mary
,
”
said
she
,
“
I
wish
you
had
gone
with
us
,
for
we
had
such
fun
!
As
we
went
along
,
Kitty
and
me
drew
up
all
the
blinds
,
and
pretended
there
was
nobody
in
the
coach
;
and
I
should
have
gone
so
all
the
way
,
if
Kitty
had
not
been
sick
;
and
when
we
got
to
the
George
,
I
do
think
we
behaved
very
handsomel
,
for
we
treated
the
other
three
with
the
nicest
co
d
luncheon
in
the

,
and
if
you
would
have
gone
,
we
would
have
treated
you
too
.
And
then
when
we
came
away
it
was
such
fun
!
I
thought
we
never
should
have
got
into
the
coach

was
ready
to
die
of
laughter

And
then
we
were
so
merry
all
the

we
talked
and
laughed
so
loud

that
anybody
might
have

To
this
Mary
very
gravely
replied
,
“
Far
be
it
from
me
,
my
dear
sister
,
to
depreciate
such
pleasures
!
They
would

But
I

they

have

for
me
—

inﬁnitely
prefer
a
book
.
'
But
of
this
answer
Lydia
heard
not
a
word
.
She
seldom
listened
to
anybody
for
more
than
half
a
minute
,
and
never
attended
to
Mary
at
all
.
In
the
afternoon
I.
dia
was
urgent
with
the
lest
of
the
girls
to
walk
to
eryton
,
and
see
how
everybody
went
on
;
but
Eliubeth
steadily
applaud
the
scheme
.
It
should
not
be
said
that
the
Miss
ennets
could
not
be
at
home
half
a
day
before
they
were
in
unuit
of
the
oﬂicers
.
There
was
another
reason
too
or
her
opposition
.
She
dreaded
seeing
Wickharn
again
,
and
was
resolved
to
avoid
it
as
long
as
possible
.
The
comfort
to
lur
of
the
regiment
s
approaching
removal
was
indeed
beyond
expression
.
In
a
fortnight
they
were
to
go
—
and
once
gone
,
she
hoped
there
could
be
nothing
more
to
lague
her
on
his
account
.
he
had
not
been
many
hours
at
home
before
she
found
that
the
Brighton
scheme
,
of
which
Lydia
had
given
them
a
hint
at
the
inn
,
was
under
frequent
discussion
between
her
parents
.
Elizabeth
saw
directly
that
her
father
had
not
the
smallest
intention
of
yielding
;
but
his
answers
were
at
the
same
time
so
vague
and
equivocal
,
that
her
mother
,
though
often
disheartened
,
had
never
yet
despaired
of
succeeding
at
last
.

LIZABETH’S
impatience
to
acquaint
Jane
with
.
what
had
happened
could
no
longer
be
overcome
;
and
at
length
,
resolving
to
suppress
every
particular
in
which
her
sister
was
concerned
,
and
prePRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.
4|
paring
her
to
be
surprised
,
she
related
to
her
the
next
morning
the
chief
of
the
scene
between
Mr
Darcy
and
herself
.
Miss
Bennet’s
astonishment
was
soon
lessened
by
the
strait
sisterly
partiality
which
made
any
admiration
of
Eliza
th
appear
perfectly
natural
;
and
all
sin-prize
was
shortly
lost
in
other
feelings
.
She
was
sorry
that
Mr
Darcy
should
have
delivered
his
sentiments
in
a
manner
so
little
suited
to
recommend
them
;
but
still
more
was
she
grieved
for
the
unhappiness
which
her
sister’s
refusal
must
have
given
him
.
“
His
being
so
sure
of
succeeding
was
wrong
,
”
said
she
,
“and
ceminly
ought
not
to
have
appeared
;
but
consider
how
much
it
must
increase
his
disappointment
!
”
“
Indeed
,
”
replied
Elizabeth
,
"
I
am
heartily
sorry
for
him
;
but
he
has
other
feelings
,
which
will
probably
soon
drive
away
his
regard
for
me
.
You
do
not
blame
me
,
however
,
or
refusing
him
i”
“
Blame
you
!
Oh
,
no
.
'
“
But
you
blame
me
for
having
spoken
so
warmly
of
Wickham
?
"
"
No
—
I
do
not
know
that
you
were
wrong
in
saying
what
you
did.”
“
But
you
evil
know
it
,
when
I
have
told
you
what
halgxned
the
very
next
day
.
'
he
then
spoke
of
the
letter
,
repeating
the
whole
of
its
contents
as
far
as
they
concerned
George
Wickham
.
What
a
stroke
was
this
for
poor
Jane
!
who
would
willingly
have
gone
through
the
world
without
believing
that
so
much
wickedness
existed
in
the
whole
race
of
mankind
,
as
was
here
collected
in
one
individual
.
Nor
was
Darcy’s
vindication
,
though
grateful
to
her
feelings
,
capable
of
consoling
her
for
such
discovery
.
Most
earnestly
did
she
labour
to
prove
the
probability
of
error
,
and
seek
to
clear
one
without
involving
the
other
.
“
This
will
not
do
,
'
said
Eliubeth
;
“
you
never

will
be

to
make

of

good
for

,

on

is

enough

pnrt
,
I
am
inclined

;
but
you
shall
do
as
you
chute.”
It
was
some
time
,
however
,
before
a
smile
could
be
extorted
from
Jane
.
“
I
do
not
know
when
I
have
been
more
shocked
,
”
said
she
.
“Wickhsm
so
very
bad
!
It
is
almost

.
And
poor
Mr

!
Dear
Lizzy
,
only

must
have
suffered

0

It
is

distressing
.

you
must
feel
it
I0
.
“Oh
!
no

my
regret
and
compassion
are
all
done
own
by
seeing
you
so
full
of
both
.
I
know
you
will
do
liim
such
ample
justice
,
that
I
am
growing
every
moment
more
unconcerned
and
indifferent
.
Your
pmfusion
makes
me
saving
;
and
if
you
lament
over

much
longer
,
my
heart
will
be

“Poor
Wickham
!
there
is
such
an
expression
of
goodness
in
his
countenance
!
such
an
openness
and
gentleness
in
his
manner

There
certainly
was
some
great
mismanagement
in
the
education
of
those
two
young
men
.
One
has
got
all
the
goodness
,
and
the
other
all
the

it.”
“I
never
thought
Mr

deﬁcient
in
the
appearance
of
it
as
you
used
to
do
.
'
"
And
yet
I
meant
to
be
uncommonly
clever
in
taking
so
decided
a
dislike
to
him
,
without
any
reason
.
It
is
such
a
spur
to
one’s
genius
,
such
an
opening
for
wit
,
to
have
a
dislike
of
that
kind

may

without

;

paused
a
little
,

replied
,

“You

have

He
is
now
,
perhaps

for

,

anxious
to
re-establuh

.
We
must
not

him

The
tumult
of
Eliulx'th’s
mind
was
ullaycd
by
this
conversation
.
She
had
got
rid
of
two
of
the
secrets
which
had
weighed
on
her
for
a
fortnight
,
and
was
certain
of
a
willing
listener
in
June
,
whenever
she
might
wish
to
talk
again
of
either
.
But
there
was
still
something
lurking
behind
,
of
which
prudence
forbad
the
disclosure
.
She
dared
not
relate
the
other
half
of
Mr
Darcy
s
letter
,
nor
explain
to
her
sister
how
sincerely
she
had
been
valued
by
his
friend
.
Here
was
knowledge
in
which
no
one
could
partake
;
and
she
was
sensible
that
nothing
less
than
a
perfect
understanding
between
the
parties
could
justify
her
in
throwing
off
this
last
encumbmnce
of

stcry
.
“
And
then
,

said
she
,
“

She
was
now
,
on
being
settled
at
home
,
at
leisure
to
observe
the
real
state
of
her
sister
s
spirits
.
Jane
was
not
happﬁ
.
She
still
cherished
a
very
tender
affection
for
ingley
.
Having
never
even
fancied
herself
in
love
before
,
her
regard
had
all
the
warmth
of
ﬁrst
attachment
,
and
,
from
her
age
and
disposition
,
greater
steadiness
than

:
attachments
often
boast
;
and
so
fervently
did
she
value
his
rcmembmnee
,
and
prefer
him
to
every
other
man
,
that
all
her
good
sense
,
and
all
her
attention
to
the
feelings
of
her
friends
,
were
requisite
to
check
the
indulgence
of
those
regrets
which
must
have
been
injurious
to
her
own
health
and
their
tranquillity

It

not

She
was

and
to
fret
over
unavoidable
evils
,
or
augment
them
by
anxiety
.
was
no
part
of
her
disposition
.
Hind
Lydia
and
her
mother
known
the
substance
of
her
conference
with
her
father
,
their
indignation
would
hardly
have
found
expression
in
their
united
volubility
.
In
Lydia’s
imagination
,
a
visit
to
Brighton
comprised
every
possibility
of
earthly
happiness
.
She
saw
,
with
the
creative
eye
of
fancy
,
the
streets
of
that
guy
bathingplace
covered
with
officers
.
She
saw
herself
the
object
or
attention
to
tens
and
to
scam
of
them
at
present
unknown
.
She
taw
all
the
glories
of
the
camp
—
its
tent
:
‘
stretched
forth
in
beauteous
uniformity
of
lines
,
crowded
with
the
youn
and
the
gay
,
and
dazzling
with
scarlet
;
and
,
to
compete
the
view
,
she
saw
herself
seated
beneath
a
tent
,
tenderly
ﬂirting
with
at
least
six
ofﬁcers
at
once
.
Had
she
known
that
her
sister
sought
to
tear
her
from
euch
prospects
and
web
realities
as
these
,
what
would
have
been
her
sensations
?
They
could
have
been
understood
only
by
her
mother
,
who
might
have
felt
nearly
the
same
.
Lydia’s
going
to
Brighton
was
all
that
consoled
her
for
her
melancholy
conviction
of
her
husband’s
never
intending
to
go
there
himself
.
But
they
were
entirely

Elizabeth
could
not
repress
a
smile
at
this
,
but
she
answered
only
by
a
Blight
inclination
of
the
head
.
She
saw
that
he
wanted
to
engage
her
on
the
old
subject
of
his
grievances
,
and
she
was
in
no
humour
to
indulge
him

domestic

;
and
,
though
Kitty
might
in
time
‘n
her
natural
degree
of
sense
,
since
the
disturbers
0
her
brain
were
removed
,
her
other
sister
,
from
whose
disposition
greater
evil
might
be
apprehended
,
was
likely
to
be
hardened
in
all
her
folly
and
assurance
by
a
situation
of
such
double
danger
as
a
watering-place
and
‘
a
camp
.
Upon
the
whole
,
therefore
,
she
found
,
what
has
been
sometimes
found
before
,
that
an
event
to
which
she
had
looked
forward
with
impatient
desire
did
not
,
in
taking
ace
,
bring
all
the
satisfaction
she
had
promised
hersef
.
It
was
consequently
necessary
to
name
some
other
period
for
the
commencement
of
actual
felicity
—
to
have
some
other
point
on
which
her
wishes
and
hopes
might
be
ﬁxed
,
and
by
again
enjoying
the
pleasure
of
anticipation
,
console
herself
for
the
present
,
and
prepare
for
another
disappointment
.
Her
tour
to
the
Lakes
was
now
the
object
of
her
happiest
thou
hts
;
it
was
her
best
consolation
for
all
the
unortable
hours
which
the
discontentean
of
her
mother
and
Kitty
made
inevitable
;
and
could
she
have
included
Jane
in
the
scheme
,
every
part
of
it
would
have
been
perfect
.
f‘But
it
is
fortunate
,
”
thought
she
,
“
that
I
have
something
to
wish
for
.
Were
the
whole
arrangement
complete
,
my
disappointment
would
be
certain
.
But
here
,
my
carrying
with
me
one
ceaseless
source
of
regret
in
my
sister’s
absence
,
I
may
reasonably
hope
to
have
all
my
expectations
of
pleasure
realised
.
A
scheme
of
which
every
part
promises
delight
can
never
be
successful
;
and
general
disappointment
is
only
warded
off
by
the
defence
of
some
little
peculiar
vexntion
.
'
When
Lydia
went
away
,
she
promised
to
write
very
often
and
very
minutely
to
her
mother
and
Kitty
;
but
her
letters
were
always
long
expected
,
and
always
very
short

The
families
who
had
been
in
town
for
the
wmter
came
back
again
,
and
summer
ﬁnery
and
summer
engagements
arose
.
Mrs
Bonnet
was
restored
to
her
usual
querulous
serenity
;
and
,
by
the
middle
of
June
,
Kitty
was
so
much
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
enter
Meryton
without
tears
;
an
event
of
such
happy
promise
as
to
make
Elizabeth
hope
that
by
the
followrng
Christmas
she
might
be
so
tolerany
reasonable
as
not
to

an
oﬂiccr
above

,

,
by
some
cruel
and
malicious
arrangement
at
the
War
Ofﬁce
,
another
regiment
should
be
quartered
in
Meryton
.
The
time
ﬁxed
for
the
beginning
of
their
northern
tour
was
now
fast
approaching
,
and
a
fortni
ht
only
was
wanting
of
it
,
when
a
letter
arrived
from
n
Gardiner
,
which
at
once
delayed
its
commencement
and
curtailed
its
extent
.
Mr
Gardiner
would
be
prevented
b
business
from
setting
out
till
a
fortnight
later
in
Ju
y
,
and
must
be
in
London
again
within
a
month
;
and
as
that
left
too
short
a
period
for
them
to
go
so
far
,
and
see
to
much
as
they
had
proposed
,
or
at
least
to
see
it
with
the
leisure
and
comfort
they
had
built
on

were

tour
,
and
,
according
to
the
present
plan
,
were
to
go
no
farther
northward
than
Derbyshire
.
In
that
com
there
was
enough
to
be
seen
to
occupy
the
chief
of
therr
three
weeks
;
and
to
Mn
Gardiner
it
had
a
peculiarly
strong
attraction
.
The
town
where
lhe
had
formerly
pane
some
can
of
her
life
,
and
where
they
were
now
to
spend
a
cw
do
a
,
was
probably
as
great
an
object
of
her
curioeit
as
l
the
celebrated
beautieu
of
Madock
,
Chauworth
,
ovedale
,
or
the
Peak
.
Elizabeth
was
excessively
dilappointed
;
she
had
set
her
heart
on
seeing
the
Lakes
,
and
still
thought
there
might
have
been
time
enough
.
But
it
was
her
burineu
to
be
eatilﬁed
—
and
certainly
her
temper
to
be
happy
;
and
all
was
soon
right
again.‘
With
the
mention
of
Derby-hire
there
were
many
ideas
connected
.
It
was
in
ble
for
her
to
see
the
word
without
thinking
of
mberley
and
its
owner
.
"
But
surely
,
”
said
she
,
“
I
may
enter
hie
county
with
impunity
,
and
rob
it
of
a
few
petriﬁed
aparwithout
hit
perceiving
me.”
The
period
of
expectation
was
now
doubled
.
Four
weeks
were
to
pass
away
before
her
uncle
and
aunt’s
anival
.
But
they
did
pass
away
,
and
Mr
and
Mn
Gardiner
,
with
their
four
children
,
did
at
length
appear
at
Longbourn
.
The
children
,
two
girl
:
of
six
and
eight
years
old
,
and
two
younger
boys
,
were
to
be
left
under
the
cular
care
of
their
cousin
Jane
,
who
was
the
gene
favourite
,
and
whoee
cready
come
and
tweetneu
of
temper
exactly
adapted
her
for
attending
to
them
in
every
way
—
teaching
them
,
playing
with
them
,
and
loving
them
.
The

to

A
small
part
of
Derhyshire
is
all
the
present
concern
.
To
the
little
town
of
Lambton
,
the
scene
of
Mrs
Gardiner
s
former
residence
,
and
where
she
had
lately
learned
that
some
acquaintance
still
remained
,
they
bent
their
steps
,
after
having
seen
all
the
princiial
wonders
of
the
count
;
and
within
five
mich
of
.nmbton
,
Elizabeth
found
rom
her
aunt
that
l’
-mbcrlcy
was
situated
.
It
was
not
in
their
din-ct
roml
,
nor
more
than
a
mile
or
two
out
of
it
.
In
talking
over
their
route
the
evening
before
,
Mrs
Gardiner
expressed
an
inclination
to
see
the
place
again
.
Mr
Gardiner
declared
his
willingness
,
and
Elizabeth
was
applied
to
for
her
approbation
.
“My
love
,
should
not
you
like
to
see
a
place
of
which
you
have
heard
so
much
?
”
said
her
aunt
;
“a
place
,
too
,
with
which
so
many
of
your
acquaintance
are
connected
.
Wickham
passed
all
his
youth
there
,
you
know.”
Elizabeth
was
distressed
.
She
felt
that
she
had
no
business
at
Pemberley
,
and
was
obliged
to
assume
a
disinclinntion
for
seeing
it
.
She
must
own
that
she
was
tired
of
great
houses
;
after
going
over
so
many
,
she
really
had
no
pleasure
in
ﬁne
carpet
:
or
satin
curtains
.
rs
Gardiner
abused
her
stupidity
.
“
If
it
were
merely
a
ﬁne
house
richly
furnished
,
'
said
she
,
“I
should
not
care
about
it
myself
;
but
the
grounds
are
delightful
.
They
have
some
of
the
ﬁnest
woods
in
the
country
.
'
Elizabeth
said
no
more
—
but
her
mind
could
not

$

acquiesce
.
The
possibility
of
meeting
Mr
Darcy
,
while
viewing
the
place
,
instantly
occurred
.
It
would
he
dreadful
!
She
blushed
at
the
very
idea
,
and
thought
it
would
be
better
to
cpeak
openly
to
her
aunt
than
to
run
such
a
risk
.
But
against
this
there
were
objection
;
and
the
ﬁnally
resolved
that
it
could
be
the
last
resource
,
if
her
private
inquiries
us
to
the
absence
of
the
family
were
unfavourably
answered
.
Accordin
1y
,
when
she
retired
at
night
,
she
asked
the
chambermai
whether
Pemberley
were
not
a
ve
line
place
,
what
was
the
name
of
its
proprietor
,
and
,
With
no
ittle
alarm
,
whether
the
family
were
down
for
the
summer
.
A
most
welcome
negative
followed
the
last
question
—
and
her
alarms
being
now
removed
,
she
was
at
leisure
to
feel
a
great
deal
of
curiosity
to
see
the
house
herself
;
and
when
the
subject
was
revived
the
next
morning
,
and
she
wae
again
applied
to
,
could
readily
answer
,
and
with
a
pr
er
air
of
indifference
,
that
she
had
not
really
any
disli
e
to
the
scheme
.
—
To
Pemberley
,
therefore
,
they
were
to
go

perturbation
;
and
when
at

they
turned
in
at

her
spirits
were
in

The

was
very

contained

in
one
of

and
drove
for
some
time
through
a
beautiful
wood
stretching
over
a
wide
extent

was

she

They
gradually

for

,
and
then
found
them-elven
at
the
top
of
a
ooon'derable
eminence
,
where
the

,
and
the
eye
was

by

waa
delighted
.
She
had
never
teen
a
place
for
which
nature
had
done
more
,
or
where
natural
beauty
had
been
IO
little
counteracted
by
an
awkward
taste
.
They
were
all
of
them
warm
in
their
admiration
;
and
at
that
moment
the
felt
that
to
be
minreu
of
Pemberley
mi
ht
be
something
!
El‘hey
descended
the
hill
,
created
the
bridge
,
and
drove
to
the
door
;
and
,
while
examining
the
nearer
upect
of
the
house
,
all
her
apprehension
of
meeting
in
owner
returned
.
She
dreaded
lest
the
chamber«
maid
had
been
miatalten
.
On
applying
to
see
the
lace
,
they
were
admitted
into
the
hall
;
and
Elizath
,
M
they
waited
for
the
houaekeeper
,
had
leisure
to
wonder
at
her
being
where
she
was
.
The
housekeeper
came
;
a
respectable-looking
elderly
woman
,
much
lean
ﬁne
,
and
more
civil
,
than
the
had
any
notion
of
ﬁndin
her
.
They
followed
her
into
the
dining-parlour
.
ﬁt
was
a
large
,
well-proportioned
room
,
handsomely
ﬁtted
up
.
Elizabeth
,
after
slightly
aurveyin
it
,
went
to
a
window
to
enjoy
its
prospect
.
The
hil
,
crowned
with
wood
,
from
which
they
had
deacended
,
receiving
increased
abruptneas
from
the
diltance
,

a
beautiful
ob'eet
.

the

of

Is
for
as
she
could
trace
it
,
with
delight
.
As
they
passed
into
other
rooms
these
objects
were
taking
different
positions
;
but
from
every
window
there
were
beauties
to
be
seen
.
The
rooms
were
lofty
and
handsome
,
end
their
furniture
suitable
to
the
fortune
of
their
proprietor
]
but
Elizabeth
saw
,
with
admiration
of
his
taste
,
that
it
was
neither
gaudy
nor
uselesst
line
;
with
less
of
s
lendour
,
and
more
real
elegance
,
than
the
furniture
of
osings
.
“And
of

'
thought
she
,
“
I
might
have
been
Inin
ith
these
rooms
I
might
now
have
been
familiarly
acquainted

Instead
of
viewing
them
as
a
stranger
,
I
might
have
rejoiced
in
them
as
my
own
,
and
welcomed
to
them
as
visitors

uncle
and
sunk

But
no

—
-recollecting
herselﬁ
—
"
that
could
never
be
:
my
uncle
and
aunt
would
have
been
lost
to
me
;
I
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
invite
them
.
'
This
was
a
lucky
recollection
—
it
saved
her
from
something
like
regret
.
She
longed
to
inquire
of
the
housekeeper
whether
her
master
was
really
absent
,
but
had
not
courage
for
it
.
At
length
,
however
,
the
question
was
asked
by
her
uncle
;
and
she
turned
away
with
alarm
,
while
Mrs
Reynolds
replied
that
he
was
,
adding
,
“
But
we
expect
hll'n
w-morrow
,
with
a
large
ﬂy
of

How
re

iced
was
Eliubeth
that
r
own
journey
had
not
y
any
circumstance
been
delayed
a
day
l
Her
aunt
now
called
her
to
look
at
a
picture
.
She
approached
and
saw
the
likeness
of
Mr
Wiekham
suspended
,
amongst
several
other
miniatures
,
over
the
mantel
iece
.
Her
aunt
asked
her
,
smilingly
,
how
she
liked
IL
The
housekeeper
came
forward
,
and
told
them
it
was
the
cture
of
a
young
gentleman
,
the
son
of
her
late
master

stewsrd
,
who
hsd
been
brought
up
by
him
at
his
own
expense
.
“He
is
now
gone
into

the
army
,
'
she
added
;
“but
I
am
afraid
he
has
turned
out
vc
wild.”
Mrs
Gardiner
looked
at
her
niece
with
a
smile
,
but
Elizabeth
could
not
mum
it
.
“And
that
,
'
said
Mn
Reynolds
,
pointing
to
enothcr
of
the
miniatures
,
“
is
my
master
—
and
we
like
him

It
was
drawn
at
the

time
as

—
about
eight
years

,

'
Mrs
Reynold’s
respect
for
Elizabeth
seemed
to
increase
on
this
intimation
of
her
knowing
her
master
.
“
Does

Indy

Elizabeth
co
cured
,
and
laid

'
“
Yes

“I

but
in
the
gallery
upstairs
you
will
see
a
ﬁner

This

was

they
lured
to

This
accounted

Mr
Gardiner
,
whose
manners
were
easy
and
pleasant
,
encouraged
her
communicativeneu
by
his
questions
and
remarks
:
Mrs
Reynolds
,
either
from
pride
and-attachment
,
had
evidently
great
pleasure
in
talking
of
her
master
and
his
sister
.
“
Is
your
master
much
at
Pemberley
in
the
course
of
the
year
i
"
"
Not
so
much
as
I
could
wish
,
sir
;
but
I
dare
say
he
may
spend
lulf
his
time
here
;
and
Miss
Darcy
ls
always
down
for
the
summer
months
.
'
"
Except
,
'
thought
Elizabeth
,
“when
she
goes
to
Ksmsgnte.”
“
If
your
master
would
marry
,
you
might
see
more
of
him
.
“Yes
,
sir
;
but
I
do
not
know
when
tlml
will
be
.
I
do
not
know
who
is
good
enough
for
him
.
'
Mr
and
Mrs
Gardiner
smiled
.
Elizabeth
could
not
help
saying
,
“It
is
very
much
to
his
credit
,
I
am
sure
,
that
ou
should
think
so.”
“
say
no
more
than
the
truth
,
and
what
everybod
will
say
that
knows
him
,
'
replied
the
other
.
Eliubet
thought
this
was
going
pretty
far
;
and
she
listened
with
increasing
astonishment
as
the
housekeeper
added
,
"
I
have
never
had
a
cross
word
from
hrm
in

life

was
four
years
0
.
’
This
was
praise
,
of
all
others
most
extraordinary
,
most
opposite
to
her
ideas
.
That
he
was
not
a
goodtempeted
man
had
been
her
ﬁrmest
opinion
.
Her
keenest
attention
was
awakened
3
she
longed
to
hear
more
,
and
was
grateful
to
her
uncle
for
saying
—
“
There
are

few

of

In

“

If
were

I

’
Elizabeth
almost
stared
at
her.
"
Can
this

i
'
thought
she
.
“
is
father
was
an
excellent
man
,
'
said
Mrs
Gardiner
.
“Yes
,
ma’am
,
that
he
was
indeed
;
and
his
son
will
be
just
like
him
—
just
as
affable
to
the
poor
.
'
Elizabeth
listened
,
wondered
,
doubted
,
and
was
impatient
for
more
.
Mrs
Reynolds
could
interest
her
on
no
other
point
.
She
related
the
subjects
of
the
pictures
,
the
dimensions
of
the
rooms
,
and
the
price
of
the
fumiture
,
in
vain
.
Mr
Gardiner
,
highly
amused
by
the
kind
of
family
prejudice
to
which
he
attributed
her
excessive
commendation
of
her
master
,
soon
led
again
to
the
subject
;
and
she
dwelt
with
energy
on
his
many
merits
no
they
proceeded
together
up
the
great
staircase
.
“
He
is
the
best
landlord
,
and
the
best
master
,
'
said
she
,
“that
ever
lived
;
not
like
the
wild
young
men
now-a-days
,
who
think
of
nothing
but
themselves

There
is
not
one
of
his
tenants
or
servants
but
what
will
give
him
a
good
name
.
Some
people
call
him
proud
;
but
I
am
sure
I
never
saw
anything
of
it
.
To
my
fancy
,
it
is
only
because
he
does
not
rattle
away
like
other
young
men

'
”
Perhaps

might
be

“That

into
a
very
pretty
sitting-room
,
lately
ﬁtted
up
with
greater
elegance
and
lightness
than
the
apartments
below
;
and
were
informed
that
it
was
but
just
done
to
give
pleasure
to
Miss
Darcy
,
who
had
taken
a
liking
to
the
room
when
last
at
Pemberley
.
“He
is
certainl
a
good
brother
,
'
said
Eliubeth
,
as
she
walked
towar
5
one
of
the
windows
.
Mrs
Reynolds
anticipated
Miss
Darcy’s
delight
,
when
she
should
enter
the
room
.
“
And
this
is
always
the
way
with
him
,
”
she
added
.
“Whatever
can
give
his
sister
any
pleasure
is
sure
to
be
done
in
a
moment
.
There
is
nothing
he
would
not
do
for

'
The
picture-gallery
,
and
two
or
three
of
the
principal
bedrooms
,
were
all
that
remained
to
be
shown
.
In
the
former
were
many
good
paintings
;
but
Elizabeth
knew
nothing
of
the
art
:
and
from
such
as
had
been
already
visible
below
,
she
had
willingly
turned
to
look
at
some
drawings
of
Miss
Darcy
s
,
in
crayons
,
whose
subjects
were
usually
more
interesting
,
and
also
more
intelligible
.
In
the
gallery
there
were
many
family
portraits
,
but
they
could
have
little
to
ﬁx
the
attention
of
a
stranger
.
Elizabeth
walked
on
in
quest
of
the
only
face
whose
features
would
be
known
to
her
.
At
last
it
arrested
her
—
and
she
beheld
a
striking
resemblance
of
Mr
Darcy
,
with
such
a
smile
over
the
face
as
she
remembered
to
have
sometimes
seen
when
he
looked
at
her
.
She
stood
several
minutes
before
the
picture
,
in
earnest
contemplation
,
and
returned
to
it
again
before
they
quitted
the
gallery
.
Mrs
Reynolds
informed
them
that
it
had
been
taken
in
his
father’s
lifetime
.
There
was
certainly
at
this
moment
,
in
Elizabeth's
mind
,
a
more
gentle
sention
towards
the
original
than
she
had
ever
felt
in
the
height
of
their
acquaintance
.
The
commendation
bestowed
on
him
by
Mrs
Reynolds
was
of
no
triﬂing
nature
.
What
praise
is
more
valuable
than
the
praise
of
an
intelligent
servant
?

ression
of
surprize
,
on
beholding
his
master
,
must
immediately
have
told
it
.
They
stood
a
little
aloof
while
he
was
talkin
to
their
niece
,
who
,
astonished
and
confused
,
scarcey
dared
lift
her
eyes
to
his
face
,
and
knew
not
what
answer
she
returned
to
his
civil
inquiries
after
her
family
.
Amazed
at
the
alteration
of
his
manner
since
they
last
parted
,
every
sentence
that
he
uttered
was
increasing
her
embarrassment
;
and
every
idea
of
the
impropriety
of
her
being
found
there
recurring
to
her
mind
,
the
few
minutes
in
which
they
continued
together
were
some
of
the
most
uncomfortable
of
her
life
.
Nor
did
he
seem
much
more
at
ease
:
when
he
spoke
,
his
accent
had
none
of
its
usual
sedateness
;
and
he
ated
his
inquiries
us
to
the
time
of
her
having
leftﬁngboum
,
and
of
her
stay
in
Derbyshire
,
so
often
,
and
in
so
hurried
a
way
,
as
plainly
spoke
the
distraction
of
his
thoughts
.
At
length
every
idea
seemed
to
fail
him
;
and
,
after
standing
a
few
moments
without
saying
a
word
,
he
suddenly
recollected
himself
,
and
took
leave
.
The
others
then
joined
her
,
and
expressed
their
admiration
of
his
ﬁgure
;
but
Elizabeth
heard
not
a
word
,
and
,
wholly
engrossed
by
her
own
feelings
,
followed
them
in
silence
.
She
was
overpowered
by
shame
and
vexation
.
Her
coming
there
was
the
most
unfortunate
,
the
most
ill-judged
thing
in
the
world
!
How
strange
must
it
appear
to
him
!
In
what
a
disgraceful
light
might
it
not
strike
so
vain
a
man
!
It
might

or
,
why

?
Had
they
been
only
ten
minutes
sooner
,
they
should
have
been
beyond
the
reach
of
his
discrimination
;
for
it
was
plain
that
he
was

—

.
And
his
behaviour
,
so
strikingly
altered
,
—
what
could
it
mean
?
That
he
should
even
speak
to
her
was
amazing
l
—
but
to
speak
with
such
civility
,
to
inquire
after
her
familyl
Never
in

had
she

his
manners
so

never

on

.
What

contrast
did
it
oHer
to
his
last
address
In

Park
,
when
he
ut
his
letter
into
her
hand
!
She
knew
not
what
to
think
,
or
how
to
account
for
it
.
They
had
now
entered
a
beautiful
walk
by
the
side
of
the
water
,
and
every
step
was
bringing
forward
a
nobler
{
all
of
ground
,
or
a
liner
reach
of
the
woods
to
which
they
were
approaching
;
but
it
was
some
time
before
Elizabeth
was
sensible
of
any
of
it
;
and
,
though
she
answered
mechanically
to
the
repeated
appeals
of
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
and
seemed
to
direct
her
eyes
to
such
objects
as
they
minted
out
,
she
distinguished
no
part
of
the
scene
.
er
thoughts
were
all
ﬁxed
on
that
one
spot
of
Pemberley
House
,
whichever
it
might
be
,
where
Mr
Darcy
then
was
.
She
longed
to
know
what
at
that
moment
was
passing
in
his
mind
—
in
what
manner
he
thought
of
her
,
and
whether
,
in
deﬁance
of
everything
,
she
was
still
dear
to
him
.
Perhaps
he
had
been
civil
only
because
he
felt
himself
at
ease
;
yet
there
had
been
[
bat
in
his
voice
which
was
not
like
ease
.
Whether
he
had
felt
more
of
pain
or
of
pleasure
in
seeing
her
she
could
not
tell
,
but
he
certainly
had
not
seen
her
with
composure
.
At
length
,
however
,
the
remarks
of
her
corn
nions
on
her
absence
of
mind
roused
her
,
and
she
elt
the
necessity
of
appearing
more
like
herself
.
They
entered
the
woods
,
and
bidding
adieu
to
the
river
for
a
while
,
ascended
some
of
the
higher
grounds
;
whence
,
in
spots
where
the
opening
of
the
trees
gave
the
eye
power
to
wander
,
were
many
charming
views
of
the
valley
,
the
opposite
hills
,
with
the
long
range
of
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.
69
woods
overspreading
many
,
and
occasional

part
of
the
stream
.
Mr
Gardiner
expressed
a
wish
0
going
round
the
whole
park
,
but
feared
it
might
be
beyond
a
walk
.
With
a
triumphant
smile
,
they
were
told
that
it
was
ten
miles
round
.
It
settled
the
matter
;
and
they
pursued
the
accustomed
circuit
;
which
brought
thema
ain
,
aﬁer
some
time
,
in
a
descent
among
hanging
w
to
the
edge
of
the
water
,
in
one
of
its
narrowest
parts
.
They
crossed
it
b
a
simple
bridge
,
in
character
with
the
general
air
0
the
scene
;
it
was
s
t
less
adorned
than
any
they
had
yet
visited
;
and
t
e
valley
,
here
contracted
into
a
glcn
,
allowed
room
only
for
the
stream
,
and
a
narrow
walk
amidst
the
rough
coppice-wood
which
bordered
it
.
Elizabeth
longed
to
explore
its
windings
;
but
when
they
had
crossed
the
bridge
,
and
perceived
their
distance
from
the
house
,
Mrs
Gardiner
,
who
was
not
a
great
walker
,
could
go
no
farther
,
and
thought
onl
of
returning
to
the
carriage
as
quickly
as
possible
.
er
niece
was
,
therefore
,
obliged
to
submit
,
and
they
took
their
way
towards
the
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
,
in
the
nearest
direction
;
but
their
progress
was
slow
,
for
Mr
Gardiner
,
though
seldom
able
to
indulge
the
taste
,
was
very
fond
of
ﬁshing
,
and
was
so
much
engaged
in
watching
the
occasional
appearance
of
some
trout
in
the
water
,
and
talking
to
the
man
about
them
,
that
he
advanced
but
little
.
Whilst
wandering
on
in
this
slow
manner
,
they
were
again
surprized
and
Elizabeth’s
astonishment
was
quite
equal
to
what
it
had
been
at
first
,
by
the
sight
of
Mr
Darcy
approaching
them
,
and
at
no
great
distance
.
The
walk
being
here
less
sheltered
than
on
the
other
side
,
allowed
them
to
see
him
before
they
met
.
Elizabeth
,
however
astonished
,
was
at
least
more
prepared
for
an
interview
than
before
,
and
resolved
to
appear
and
to
speak
with
calmness
,
if
he
really
intended
to
meet
them
.
For
a
few
moments
,
indeed
,
she
felt
that
he
would
pro7o
PRIDE
AND
pitEJumcis‘
.
habl
strike
into
some
other
path
.
The
idea
lasted
whie
a
turning
in
the
walk
concealed
him
from
their
view
;
the
tumin
past
,
he
was
immediatel
before
them
.
With
a
g
ancc
,
she
saw
that
he
had
0st
none
of
his
recent
civility
;
and
,
to
imitate
his
politeness
,
she
'
began
as
they
met
to
admire
the
beaut
of
the
place
;
but
she
had
not
got
beyond
the
we
s
“deli
htful
,
'
and
“charming
,
”
when
some
unlucky
recolectionl
obtruded
,
and
she
fancied
that
praise
of
Pemberley
from
her
might
be
mischievously
construed
.
Her
colour
changed
,
and
she
said
no
more
.
Mrs
Gardiner
was
standing
at
little
behind
;
and
on
her
pausing
,
he
asked
her
if
she
would
do
him
the
honour
of
introducing
him
to
her
friends
.
This
was
a
stroke
of
civility
for
which
she
was
quite
unprepared
;
and
she
could
hardly
suppress
a
smile
at
his
being
now
seeking
the
acquaintance
of
some
of
those
very
(
people
against
whom
his
pride
had
revolted
in
his

herself
.
“What
will
be

,
”
thought
she
,
“
when

knows
who
they
are
?
He
takes
them
now

.
'
1
he
introduction
,
however
,
was
immediately
made
;
and
as
,
e
named
their
relationship
to
herself
,
she
stole
a
sly
look
at
him
,
to
see
how
he
bore
it
,
and
was
not
without
the
expectation
of
his
decamping
as
fast
as
he
could
from
such
disgraceful
companions
.
That
he
was
(
Mrs-2:1
!
by
the
connexion
was
evident
;
he
sustained
it
,
however
,
with
fortitude
,
and
,
so
far
from
going
away
,
turned
back
with
them
,
and
entered
into
conversation
with
Mr
Gardiner
.
Elizabeth
could
not
but
be
pleased
,
could
not
but
triumph
.
It
was
consoling
that
he
should
know
she
had
some
relations
for
whom
there
was
no
need
to
blush
.
She
listened
most
attentively
to
all
that
passed
between
them
,
and
gloried
in
every
expression
,
every
sentence
of
her
uncle
,
which
marked
his
intelligence
,
his
taste
,
or
his
good
manners

The
conversation
soon
turned
upon
ﬁshing
;
and
she
heard
Mr
Darcy
invite
him
,
with
the
greatest
civility
,
to
ﬁsh
there
as
often
as
he
chose
while
he
continued
In
the
neighbourhood
,
offering
at
the
same
time
to
supply
him
with
ﬁshing
tackle
,
and
pointing
out
those
parts
of
the
stream
where
there
was
usually
most
sport
.
Mrs
Gardiner
,
who
was
walking
arm-and-arm
with
Elizabeth
,
gave
her
a
look
expressive
of
her
wonder
.
Elizabeth
said
nothing
,
but
it
gratiﬁed
her
exceedingly
;
the
compliment
must
be
all
for
herself
.
Her
astonishment
,
however
,
was
extreme
,
and
continually
was
she
repeating
,
“
Why
is
he
so
altered
?
From
what
can
it
proceed
?
It
can
not
be
for
rue
—
it
can
not
be
for
my
sake
that
his
manners
are
thus
softened
.
My
re
roofs
at
Hunsford
could
not
work
such
a
change
as
this
.
It
is
impossible
that
he
should
still
love
me.’
After
walking
some
time
in
this
way
,
the
two
ladies
in
front
,
the
two
gentlemen
behind
,
on
resuming
their
Elms
,
after
descending
to
the
brink
of
the
river
for
the
etter
inspection
of
some
curious
water-plant
,
there
chanced
to
be
a
little
alteration
.
It
originated
in
Mrs
Gardiner
,
who
,
fatigued
by
the
exercise
of
the
morning
,
found
Elizabeth’s
arm
inadequate
to
her
support
,
and
consequently
preferred
her
husband
s
.
Mr
Darcy
took
her
place
by
her
niece
,
and
they
walked
on
together
.
After
a
short
silence
,
the
lady
ﬁrst
spoke
.
She
wished
him
to
know
that
she
had
been
assured
of
his
absence
before
she
came
to
the
place
,
and
accordingly
began
by
observing
,
that
his
arrival
had
been
very
unexpected
—
—
“
for
your
housekeeper
,
”
she
added
,
“informed
us
that
you
would
certainly
not
be

till

;
and

,

understood
that

.
'
he
acknowledged
the
truth
of
it
all
,
and
said
that
business
with
his
steward
had
occasioned
his
coming
forward
a
few
hours
before
the

of

Yet
time
and
her
aunt
moved
slowly
—
and
her
patience
and
her
ideas
were
nearly
worn
out
before
the
lite-54m
was
over
.
On
Mr
and
Mrs
Gnrdiner’
s
coming
up
they
were
all
pressed
to
go
into
the
house
and
take
some
refreshment
;
but
this
was
declined
,
and
they
md
on
each
side
with
the
utmost
politeness
.
Mr
arcy
handed
the
ladies
into
the
can-isge
;
and
when
it
drove
of
,
Elizabeth
saw
him
walking
slowly
towards
the
house
.
The
observations
of
her
uncle
and
aunt
now
began
;
and
each
of
them
pronounced
him
to
be
infinitely
superior
to
an
thing
they
had
expected.
"
He
Is

!
well
behaved
,
polite
,

,
”
said
her
unc
e
.
“There
it
something
a
little
mtely
in
him
,
to
be
sure
,
”
replied
her
aunt
;
“
but
it
is
conﬁned
to
his
air
,
and
is
not
unbecoming
.
I
can
now
say
with
the
housekeeper
,
that
though
some
people
may
call
him
proud
,
I
have
seen
nothing
ofit.’
“I
was
never
more
surprized
than
by
his
behaviour
to
us
.
It
was
more
than
civil
;
it
was
really
attentive
;
and
there
was
no
necessity
for
such
attention
.
His
acquaintance
with
Elizabeth
was
very
triﬂing.”
“To
be
sure
,
Lizzy
,
”
said
her
aunt
,
“he
is
not
so
handsome
as
Wickham
;
or
,
rather
,
he
has
not
Wickham’s
countenance
,
for
his
features
are
perfectly
good
.
But
how
came
you
to
tell
me
that
he
was
so
disagreeable
?
"
Elizabeth
excused
herself
as
Well
as
she
could
:
said
that
she
had
liked
him
better
when
they
met
in
Kent
than
before
,
and
that
she
had
never
seen
him
so
pleasant
as
this
morning
.
“But
perhaps
he
may
be
a
little
whimsical
in
his
civilities
,
‘
replied
her
uncle
.
“Your
great
men
often
are
;
and
therefore
I
shall
not
take
him
at
his
word
about
ﬁshing
,
as
he
might
change
his
mind
another
dny
,

warn
me

PRIDE
AND

Elizabeth
felt
that
they
had
entirely
mistaken
his
character
,
but
said
nothing
.
“
From
what
we
have
seen
of
him
,
”
continued
Mn
Gardiner
,
“I
really
should
not
have
thought
that
he
could
have
behaved
in
so
cruel
a
way
by
anybody
as
he
has
done
by
poor
Wickhsm
.
He
has
not
an
ill-natured
loolt
.
0n
the
contrary
,
there
is
something
pleasing
about
his
mouth
when
he
speaks
.
And
there
is
something
of
dignity
in
his
countenance
,
that
would
not
give
one
an
un
avourable
idea
of
his
heart
.
But
,
to
be
sure
,
the
good
lady
who
showed
us
the
house
did
give
him
a
most
ﬂaming
character
!
I
could
hardly
help
laughing
aloud
sometimes
.
But
he
is
a
liberal
master
,
I
suppose
.
and
Ilia
!

eye

every
virtue
.
'
Elizabeth
here
felt
herself
called
on
to
ﬂy
something
in
vindication
of
his
behaviour
to
Wickham
;
and
therefore
gave
them
to
understand
,
in
as
guarded
a
manner
as
she
could
,
that
by
what
she
had
heard
from
his
relations
in
Kent
,
his
actions
were
capable
of
a
very
dill‘erent
construction
;
and
that
his
character
was
by
no
means
so
faulty
,
nor
Wickham’s
so
amiable
,
as
they
had
been
considered
in
Hertfordshire
.
In
conﬁrmation
of
this
,
she
related
the
particulars
of
all
the
pecuniary
transactions
in
which
they
had
been
connected
,
without
actually
naming
her
authority
,
but
stating
it
to
be
such
as
might
be
relied
on
.
Mrs
Gardiner
was
surprized
and
concerned
;
but
as
they
were
now
approaching
the
scene
of
her
former
pleasures
,
every
idea
gave
way
to
the
charm
of
recollection
;
and
she
was
too
much
engaged
in
pointing
out
to
her
husband
all
the
interesting
spots
in
its
environs
to
think
of
anything
else
.
Fatigued
as
she
had
been
by
the
moming’s
walk
,
they
had
no
sooner
dined
than
she
set
all
again
in
quest
of
her
former
ac
uaintance
,
and
the
evening
was
spent
in
the
satisfactions

an
intercourse
renewed
after
many
years’
discontinuance

The
occurrences
of
the
day
were
too
full
of
interest
to
leave
Elizabeth
much
attention
for
an
of
these
new
friends
;
and
she
could
do
nothing
but
t
ink
,
and
think
with
wonder
,
of
Mr
Darcy
s
civility
,
and
,
above
all
,
of
his
wishing
her
to
be
acquainted
with
his
sister
.
Chapter
£1,317
.
LIZABETH
had
settled
it
that
Mr
Darcy
could
bring
his
sister
to
visit
her
the
very
day
after
her
reaching
Pemberley
;
and
was
consequently
resolved
not
to
be
out
of
sight
of
the
inn
the
whole
of
that
morning
.
But
her
conclusion
was
false
;
for
on
the
very
morning
after
their
own
arrival
at
anbton
,
these
visitors
came
.
They
had
been
walking
about
the
place
with
some
of
their
new
friends
,
and
were
returned
to
the
inn
to
dress
themselves
for
dining
with
the
same
family
,
when
the
sound
of
a
carria
e
drew
them
to
a
window
,
and
they
saw
a
gentleman
and8
lady
in
a
curriclc
driving
up
the
street
.
Elizabeth
immediately
recognizing
the
livery
,
guessed
what
it
meant
,
and
imparted
no
small
degree
of
surprize
to
her
relations
by
ac
usinting
them
with
the
honour
which
she
expected
.
er
uncle
and
aunt
were
all
amazement
;
and
the
embarrassment
of
her
manner
as
she
spoke
,
joined
to
the
circumstance
itself
,
and
many
of
the
circumstances
of
the
preceding
day
,
opened
to
them
a
new
idea
on
the
business
.
Nothing
had
ever
suggested
it
before
,
but
they
now
felt
that
there
was
no
other
way
of
accounting
for
such
attentions
from
such
a
quarter
than
by
supposing
a
partiality
for
their
niece
.
While
these
newly-born
notions
were
passing
in
their
heads
,
the
perturbation
of
Elizabeth’s
feelings
was
every
moment
increasing
.
She
was
quite
amazed
at
her
own
discomposure
;

with
which
he
expressed
himself
on
seeing
her
again
.
He
inquired
in
a
friendl
,
though
general
way
,
after
her
famil
,
and
looked
an
spoke
with
the
same
goodhumou
ease
that
he
had
ever
done
.
To
Mr
and
Mrs
Gardiner
he
was
scarcely
a
less
interesting
personage
than
to
herself
.
They
had
long
wished
to
see
him
.
The
whole
party
before
them
,
indeed
,
excited
a
lively
attention
.
The
suspicions
which
had
just
arisen
of
Mr
Darcy
and
their
niece
directed
their
observation
towards
each
with
an
eamest
though
guarded
inqui
;
and
they
soon
drew
from
those
inquiries
the
ful
conviction
that
one
of
them
at
least
knew
what
it
was
to
love
.
0f
the
lady’s
sensations
they
remained
a
little
in
doubt
;
but
that
the
gentleman
was
overﬂowing
with
admiration
was
evident
enough
.
Elizabeth
,
on
her
side
,
had
much
to
do
.
She
wanted
to
ascertain
the
feelings
of
each
of
her
visitors
;
she
wanted
to
compose
her
own
,
and
to
make
herself
agreeable
to
all
;
and
in
the
latter
object
,
where
she
feared
most
to
fail
,
she
was
most
sure
of
success
,
for
those
to
whom
she
endeavoured
to
give
pleasure
were
prepossessed
in
her
favour
.
Bingley
was
ready
,
Georgiana
was
eager
,
and
Darcy
determined
,
to
be
pleased
.
In
seeing
Bingley
,
her
thoughts
naturally
ﬂew
to
her
sister
;
and
oh
!
how
ardently
did
she
long
to
know
whether
any
of
his
were
directed
in
a
like
manner
.
Sometimes
she
could
fancy
that
he
talked
less
than
on
former
occasions
,
and
once
or
twice
pleased
herself
with
the
notion
that
,
as
he
looked
at
her
,
he
was
trying
to
trace
a
resemblance
.
But
,
though
this
might
be
imaginary
,
she
could
not
be
deceived
as
to
his
behaviour
to
Miss
Darcy
,
who
had
been
set
up
as
a
rival
to
Jane
.
No
look
appeared
on
either
side
that
spoke
particular
regard
.
Nothing
occurred
be78
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICF
.
tween
them
that
could
justify
the
hopeof
his
sister
.
On
this
point
the
was
soon
satisﬁed
;
and
two
or
three
little
circumstances
occurred
ere
they
parted
,
which
,
in
her
anxious
interpretation
,
denoted
in
recollection
of
Jane
not
untincturcd
by
tenderness
,
and
a
wish
of
saying
more
that
might
lead
to
the
mention
of
her
,
had
he
dared
.
He
observed
to
her
,
nt
it
moment
when
the
others
were
talking
together
,
and
in
a
tone
which
had
something
of
real
regret
,
that
it
“was
a
very
long
time
since
he
had
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
hen
'
and
,
before
she
could
reply
,
he
added.
"
It
ll
«have
eight
months
.
We
have
not
me
!
since
the
16th
of
November
,
when
we
were
all
dancing
together
at
Netherﬁeld
.
'
Elizabeth
was
pleased
to
ﬁnd
his
memory
so
exact
;
and
he
afterwards
took
occasion
to
ask
her
,
when
unattended
to
by
any
of
the
rest
,
whether
all
her
sisters
were
at
Longhourn
.
There
was
not
much
in
the
question
,
nor
in
the
preceding
remark
;
but
there
was
a
look
and
it
manner
which
gave
them
meaning
.
It
was
not
often
that
she
could
turn
her
eyes
on
Mr
Darcy
himself
;
but
,
whenever
she
did
catch
a
glimpse
,
she
saw
an
expression
of
general
complainance
,
and
in
all
that
he
said
she
heard
an
accent
so
far
removed
from
hauteur
or
disdain
of
his
companions
,
as
convinced
her
that
the
improvement
of
manners
which
she
had
yesterday
witnessed
,
however
temporary
its
existence
might
prove
,
had
at
least
outlived
one
day
.
When
she
saw
him
thus
seeking
the
acquaintance
and
courting
the
good
opinion
of
people
with
whom
any
intercourse
a
few
months
ago
would
have
been
a
disgrace
—
when
she
saw
him
thus
civil
,
not
only
to
herself
,
but
to
the
very
relations
whom
he
had
openly
disdained
,
and
recollccted
‘their
last
lively
scene
in
Hunsford
Parsonage
,
—
the
difference
,
the
change
was
so
great
,
and
struck
so
forcibly
on
her
mind
,
that
she
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.
79
could
hardly
restrain
her
astonishment
from
being
visible
.
Never
,
even
in
the
company
of
his
dear
friends
at
Netherﬁeld
,
or
his
digniﬁed
relations
at
Rosings
,
had
she
seen
him
so
desirous
to
please
,
so
free
from
self-consequence
or
unhending
reserve
,
as
now
,
when
no
importance
could
result
from
the
success
of
his
endeavours
,
and
when
even
the
acquaintance
of
those
to
whom
his
attentions
were
addressed
would
draw
down
the
ridicule
and
censure
of
the
ladies
both
of
Netherﬁeld
and
Rosings
.
Their
visitors
stayed
with
them
above
half-an-hour
;
and
when
they
arose
to
depart
,
Mr
Darcy
called
on
his
sister
to
join
him
in
expressing
their
wish
of
seeing
Mr
and
Mrs
Gardiner
,
and
Miss
Bonnet
,
to
dinner
at
Pemberley
,
before
they
left
the
country
.
Miss
Darcy
,
though
with
a
diﬂidence
which
marked
her
little
in
the
habit
of
giving
invitations
readily
obeyed
.
Mrs
Gardiner
looked
at
her
niece
,
desirous
of
knowing
how

hut
Elizabeth
had
turned
away
her
head
.
Presuming
,
however
,
that
this
studied
avoidance
ke
rather
a
momentary
embarrassment
than
any
dislike
of
the
roposal
,
and
seeing
in
her
husband
,
who
was
fond
o
society
,
a
perfect
willingness
to
accept
it
,
she
ventured
to
engage
for
her
attendance
,
and
the
day
after
the
next
was
ﬁxed
on
.
Bingley
expressed
great
pleasure
in
the
certainty
of
seeing
Elizabeth
again
,
having
still
a
great
deal
to
say
to
her
,
and
many
inquiries
to
make
after
all
their
Hertfordshire
friends
.
Elizabeth
,
construing
all
this
into
a
wish
of
hearing
her
speak
of
her
sister
,
was
pleased
;
and
on
this
account
,
as
well
as
some
others
,
found
herself
,
when
their
visitors
left
them
,
capable
of
considering
the
last
half-hour
with
some
satisfaction
,
though
while
it
was
passing
the
enjoyment
of
it
had
been

Neither
had
anything
occurred

of

could

They
had
nothing

,
it
would

was
a

man
,

did
much

among

to
Wickham
,
the

:
soon
found
that
he
was
not
held
there
in
much
estimation
;
for
though
the
chief
of
his
concemt
with
the
son
of
his
patron
were
imperfectly
understood
,
it
was
yet
a
wellknown

that
,

As
for
Eﬁubeth
,
her
thoughts
were
at
Pemberley
this
evening
more
than
the
last
;
and
the
evening
,
though
as
it
passed
it
seemed
long
,
was
not
long
enough
to
determine
her
feelings
towards
an
:
in
that
mansion
;
and
she
lay
awake
two
whole
hours
endeavouring
to
make
them
out
.
She
certainly
did
not
hate
him
.
No
;
hatred
had
vanished
long
ago
,
and
she
had
almost
as
long
been
ashamed
of
ever
feeling
a
dislike
against
him
,
that
could
be
so
called
.
The
respect
created
by
the
conviction
of
his
valuable
qualities
,
though
at
ﬁrst
unwillingly
admitted
,
had
for
some
time
ceased
to
he
repugnant
to
her
feelings
;
and
it
was
now
heightened
into
somewhat
of
a
friendlier
nature
,
by
the
testimony
so
highly
in
his
favour
,
and
bringing
forward
his
disposition
in
so
amiable
alight
,
which
yesterday
had
produced
.
But
above
all
,
above
respect
and
esteem
,
there
was
a
motive
within
her
of
goodwill
which
could
not
be
overlooked
.
It
was
ratitudc
;
—
-gratitude
,
not
merely
for
having
once
foved
her
,
but
for
loving
her
still
well
enough
to
forgive
all
the
petulance
and
acrimony
of
her
manner
in
rejecting
him
,
and
all
the
unjust
accusations
accompan
ing
her
rejection
.
He
who
,
she
had
been
persu
ed
,
would
avoid
her
as
his
greatest
enemy
,
seemed
,
on
this
accidental
meeting
,
most
eager
to
preserve
the
acquaintance
,
and
without
any
indelicate
display
of
regard
,
or
any
peculiarity
of
manner
,
where
their

excited

ONVINCED
as
Eliubeth
now
was
that
Mice

ditlike

had
originated
in

,
she
could
not
help
feeling
how
very

her

must
be
to
her
,
and
wan
curious
to
know
with
how
much
civility
on
that
lady‘e
ride
the
acquaintance
would
now
be
renewed
.
On
reaching
the
house
,
they
were

,

,
admitted
a
most
refreshing
view
of
the
hi

wood
hills
behind
the
house
,
and
of
the
beautiful
oa
s
and
panish
chestnuts
which
were
scattered
over
the
intennediste
lawn
.
In
this
room
they
Were
received
by
Miu
Darcy
,
who
was
sitting
there
with
Mrs
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley
,
and
the
lady
with
whom
she
lived
in
London
.
Georgiana’s
reception
of
them
was
very
civil
,
but
attended
wrth
all
that
embarrassment
which
,
though
proceeding
li'om
shyness
and
the
fear
of
doing
wrong
,
would
easily
give
to
those
who
felt
themselves
inferior
the
belief
of
her
being
proud
and
reserved
,
Mrs
Gardiner
and
her
niece
,
however
,
did
her
‘ustice
,
and
pitied
her
.
By
Mrs
H‘urst
and
Miss
Bingley
they
were
noticed
only
by
a
courtsey
;
and
,
on
their
being
seated
,
a
pause
,
awkward
as
such
pauses
must
always
be
,
succeeded
for
a
few
moments
.
It
was
first
hroken
b
Mrs
Annesley
,
a
genteel
,
agreeable-looking
woman
,
w
use
[
endeavour
]
to
introduce
some
kind
of
discourse
proved
her
to
be
more
truly
well-bred
than
either
of
the
others
;
and
between
her
and
Mrs
Gardiner
,
with
occasional
help
from
Elizabeth
,
the
conversation
was
carried
on
.
Miss
Darcy
looked
as
if
she
wished
for
courage
enough
to
join
in
it
;
and
sometimes
did
venture
a
short
sentence
when
there
was
least
danger
of
its
being
heard
.
Elimbeth
soon
saw
that
she
was
herself
closely
watched
by
Miss
Bingley
,
and
that
she
could
not
speak
a
word
,
especially
to
Miss
Darcy
,
without
calling
her
attention
.
This
observation
would
not
have
prevented
her
from
trying
to
talk
to
the
latter
,
had
they
not
been
seated
at
an
inconvenient
distance
;
but
she
was
not
sorry
to
be
spared
the
necessity
of
saying
much
.
Her
own
droughts
were
em
loying
her
.
he
ex
cted
every
moment
that
some
0
the
gentlemen
wou
d
enter
the
room
.
She
wished
,
she
feared
that
the
master
of
the
house
might
be
amongst
them
;
and
whether
she
wished
84
PRIDE
AND
Hemmer
.
or
feared
it
most
,
she
could
scarcely
determine
.
Met
sitting
in
this
manner
a
quarter
of
an
hour
without
hearing
Miss
Dingley'l
voice
,
Elizabeth
was
round
b
re
.
ceiving
from
her
a
cold
inquiry
after
the
halth
oiyher
family
.
She
answered
with
equal
iodiﬁ‘erence
and
brevity
,
and
the
other
said
no
more
.
The
next
variation
which
their
viait
afforded
was
prmlucerl
by
the
entrance
of
servants
with
cold
meat
,
cake
,
and
a
variety
of
all
the
ﬁnctt
fruits
in
season
;
but
this
did
not
take
place
till
after
many
a
signiﬁcant
look
and
smile
from
Mrs
Annetley
to
Mist
Darcy
had
been
given
,
to
remind
her
of
her
post
.
There
was
now
employment
for
the
whole
party
—
for
though
they
could
not
a
I
talk
,
they
could
all
eat
;
and
the
beautiful
pyramids
of
grupen
,
nectarines
,
and
peaches
soon
collected
them
round
the
table
.
While
thus
engaged
,
Elizabeth
had
a
fair
opportunity
of
deciding
whether
the
most
fem-ed
or
wished
for
the
appearance
of
Mr
Darcy
,
by
the
feelings
which
pnevailed
on
Iiil
entering
the
room
;
and
then
,
though
but
u
moment
before
ll
)
:
had
believed
her
wishes
to
predominate
,
she
began
to
regret
that
he
came
.
He
lmd
been
some
time
with
Mr
Gardiner
,
who
,
with
two
or
three
other
gentlemen
from
the
house
,
was
engaged
by
the
river
,
and
had
left
him
only
on
learning
that
the
ladicu
of
the
family
intended
a
visit
to
Georgiana
that
morning
.
No
sooner
did
he
appear
than
Elizabeth
witer
resolved
to
be
perfectly
easy
and
unembarrasoed
;
—
o
resolution
the
more
necessary
to
be
made
,
but
perhan
not
the
more
easily
kept
,
because
she
aaw
that
the
suspicion
!
of
the
whole
party
were
awakened
against
them
,
nnd
that
their
was
scarcely
an
eye
which
did
not
watch
his
behaviour
when
he
ﬁrst
came
into
the
room
.
In
no
countennnce
was
attentive
curiosity
so
strongly
marked
at
in
Miss
Bingley’a
,
in
spite
of
the
smilewhich
ovenpread
her
face
whenever
she
spoke
to
one
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE

of
its
objects
;
for
jealousy
had
not
yet
made
her
desperate
,
and
her
attentions
to
Mr
Darcy
were
by
no
means
over
.
Miss
Darcy
,
on
her
brother’s
entrance
,
exerted
herself
much
more
to
talk
;
and
Elizabeth
law
that
he
was
anxious
for
his
sister
and
herself
to
get
acquainted
,
and
fonvnrdcd
as
much
as
possible
,
every
attempt
at
conversation
on
either
side
.
Miss
Bingley
saw
lthis
likewise
;
and
,
in
the
imprudence
of
anger
,
took
the
ﬁrst
opportunity
of
laying
,
with
sneering
civilit
—

,

shire
Militia
removed
from

?
They
must
be
a
great
loss
to
your
family
.
'
In
Darcy’s
presence
she
dared
not
mention
Wickham
s
name
;
but
Elizabeth
instantly
comprehended
that
he
was
uppermost
in
her
thoughts
;
and
the
various
recollections
connected
with
him
gave
her
a
moment’s
distress
;
but
exerting
herself
vigorously
to
repel
the
ill-natured
attack
,
she
presently
answered
the
question
in
a
tolerany
disengaged
tone
.
While
she
spoke
,
an
involuntary
glance
showed
her
Darcy
,
with
an
heightened
complexion
,
earnestly
looking
at
her
,
and
his
sister
overcome
with
confusion
,
and
unable
to
lift
up
her
eyes
.
Had
Miss
Bingle
known
what
pain
she
was
then
giving
her
beloved
frien
,
she
undoubted
]
would
have
refrained
from
the
hint
;
but
she
had
merery
intended
to
discompose
Eliubeth
,
by
bringing
forward
the
idea
of
a
man
to
whom
she
believed
her
partial
,
to
make
her
betray
a
sensibility
which
might
injure
her
in
Darcy’s
opinion
,
and
,
perhaps
,
to
remind
the
latter
of
all
the
follies
and
absurdities
by
which
some
part
of
her
family
were
connected
with
that
no
I
.
Not
a
syllable
had
ever
reached
her
of
Miss
arcy’s
mediated
elopement
.
I‘o
no
creature
had
it
been
revealed
,
where
secret
:
was
possible
,
except
to
Elizabeth
;
and
from
31
Bingley’s
connections
her
brother
was
particularly
86
PRIDE
AND
PREJ'UDICE
.
anxious
to
conceal
it
,
from
that
very
with
which
Elizabeth
had
long
ago
attributed
to
him
,
of
their
becoming
hereafter
her
own
.
He
had
certainly
formed
such
a
plan
,
and
without
meaning
that
it
should
effect
a
,
his
endeavour
to
separate
him
from
Miss
Bennet
,
it
is
probable
that
it
might
add
something
to
his
lively
concern
for
the
welfare
of
his
friend
.
Elizabeth’s
collected
behaviour
,
however
,
soon
ﬂuieted
his
emotion
;
and
as
Miss
Bingley
,
vexed
and
isappointed
,
dared
not
aPproach
nearer
to
Wickham
,
Georgiana
also
recovered
in
time
,
though
not
enough
to
be
able
to
speak
any
more
.
Her
brother
,
whose
eye
she
feared
to
meet
,
scarcely
recollected
her
interest
in
the
alfair
,
and
the
very
circumstance
which
had
been
designed
to
turn
his
thoughts
from
Elizabeth
seemed
to
have
ﬁxed
them
on
her
more
,
and
more
cheerfully
.
Their
visit
did
not
continue
long
after
the
question
and
answer
above
mentioned
;
and
while
Mr
Darcy
was
attending
them
to
their
carriage
,
Miss
Bingley
was
venting
her
feelings
in
criticisms
on
Elizabeth’s
person
,
behaviour
,
and
dress
.
But
Georgiana
would
not
join
her
.
Her
brother’s
recommendation
was
enough
to
ensure
her
favour
:
his
judgment
could
not
err
,
and
he
had
spoken
in
such
terms
of
Elizabeth
as
to
leave
Georgiana
without
the
wer
of
ﬁnding
her
otherwise
than
lovely
and
amiahll
:
I
When
Darcy
returned
to
the
saloon
,
Miss
Bingley
could
not
help
repeating
to
him
some
part
of
what
she
had
been
saying
to
his
sister
.
“How
very
ill
Eliza
Bennet
looks
this
morning
,
Mr
Darcy
,
'
she
cried
;
“I
never
in
my
life
saw
any
one
so
much
altered
as
she
is
since
the
winter
.
She
is
grown
so
brown
and
coarse
!
Louisa
and
I
were
agreeing
that
we
should
not
have
known
her
again
.
'
However
little
Mr
Darcy
might
have
liked
such
an
address
,
he
contented
himself
with
coolly
replying
that
he
perceived
no
other
alteration
than
her
being
rather
mum
:
AND
majumcrt
87
tanned
,
—
no
miraculous
consequence
of
travelling
in
the
summer
.
“
F
or
my
own
part
,
”
the
rejoined
,
“
I
must
confess
that
I
never
could
see
any
beauty
in
her
.
Her
face
is
too
thin
;
her
complexion
has
no
brilliancy
;
and
her
feaurres
are
not
at
all
handsome
.
Her
nose
wants
character
—
there
is
nothing
marked
in
its
lines
.
Her
teeth
are
tolerable
,
but
not
out
of
the
common
wa
;
and
as
for
her
eyes
,
which
have
sometimes
been
cal
ed
so
ﬁne
,
I
never
could
perceive
anything
extraordinary
in
them
.
They
have
a
sharp
,
shrewish
look
,
which
I
do
not
like
at
all
;
and
in
her
air
altogether
there
is
s
self-sufﬁciency
without
fashion
,
which
is
intolerable.”
‘
Persuaded
as
Miss
Bingley
was
that
Darcy
admired
Elizabeth
,
this
was
not
the
best
method

from

afterwards
she
seemed
to
improve
on
you

I
believe
you
thought
her
rather
pretty
at
one

“
Yes

replied
Darcy
,
who
could
contain
himself
no

,
“but
that
was
only
when

a
match
on

at
I
am
willing
to
hope
the

and
that
his
character
has
been
misunderstood
.
Thonghtless
and
indiscreet
I
can
easily
believe
him
,
but
this
step
(
and
let
us
rejoice
over
it
)
marks
nothing
bad
at
heart
.
His
choice
is
disinterested
at
least
,
for
he
must
know

can

Our
poor
mother
is
sadly

How
thankful
am
I
that
we
never
let

what
has
been
said
against

!
we
must
forget

They
were
olf
Saturday
night
about
twelve
,
as
is
conjectured
,
but
were
not
missed
till
yesterday
morning
at

was

Lydia
left
a
few
lines
for
his
wife
,
informing
her
of
their
intention
.
I
must
conclude
,
for
I
can
not
be

my
poor

I
am
afraid
you

not

Without
allowing
herself
time
for
consideration
,
and
scarcely
knowing
what
she
felt
,
Elizabeth
on
ﬁnishing
this
letter
instantly
seized
the

opening
it
with
the
utmost
impatience
,
read
as

:
it

been
written
a

and
before

enough
to

she
,
in

every

was
superseded
by

hastily
exclaimed
,

“Good

I
what
is

”
cried
he
,
with
more
feeling
than
politeness
;
then
recollecting
himself
,
“I
will
not

you
a

;

Elizabeth
hesitated
,
but
her
knees
trembled
under
her
,
and
she
felt
how
little
would
be
gained
by
her
attem
ting
to
pursue
them
.
Calling
back
the
servant
,
there
ore
,
she
commissioned
him
,
though
in
so
bmthless
an
accent
as
made
her
almost
unintelligible
,
to
fetch
his
master
and
mistress
home
instantly
.
On
his
quitting
the
room
she
sat
down
,
unable
to
support
herself
,
and
looking
so
miserably
ill
,
that
it
was
impossible
for
Darcy
to
leave
her
,
or
to
refrain
from
saying
,
in
a
tone
of
gentleness
and
commiseration
,
“

“No

she
replied
,
endeavouring
to
recover
herself
.
“There
is
nothing

She
burst
into
tears
as
she
alluded
to
it
,
and
for
a
few
minutes
could
not
speak
another
word
.
Darcy
,
in
wretched
suspense
,
could
only
say
something
indistinctly
of
his
concern
,
and
observe
her
in
com
—
passionate
silence

At
length
she
spoke
again
.

I

his

Darcy
made
no

He
seemed

was

,

Lydia
—
the
humiliation
,
the
misery
she
was
bringing
on
them
all
,
soon
swallowed
up
every
private
care
;
and
covering
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
,
Elizabeth
was
soon
lost
to
everything
else
;
and
,
after
a
pause
of
several
minutes
,
was
only
recalled
to
a
sense
of
her
situation
by
the
voice
of
her
companion
,
who
,
in
a
manner
which
,
though
it
spoke
compassion
,
spoke
likewise
restraint
,
said
,
“I
am
afraid
you
have
been
long
desiring
my
absence
,
nor
have
I
anything
to
plead
in

of

unavailing

concern

Would
to

that
anything
could
be
either

done
on

that
might
offer
consolation
to
such
distress
!
—
But
I
will
not
torment
you
with
vain
wishes
,
which
may
seem
purposely
so
ask
for
your
thanks
.
This
unfortunate
aifair
will
,
I
fear
,
prevent
my
sister’s
having
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
at
Pemberley
to-day

'
“Oh

so
kind
as
to

for

and
leaving
his
com
limcnts
for
her
relations
,
with
only

serious

went
away
.
As

quitted
the
room
,
Elizabeth
felt
how

95
bable
it
was
that
they
should
ever
see
each
other
again
on
such
terms
of
cordiality
as
had
marked
their
several
meetings
in
Derbyshire
;
and
as
she
threw
a
retrospective
glance
over
the
whole
of
their
acquaintance
,
so
full
of
contradicu'ons
and
varieties
,
sighed
at
the
perverseness
of
those
feelings
which
would
now
have
mmoted
in
continuance
,
and
would
formerly
have
rejoiced
in
its
termination
.
If
gratitude
and
esteem
are
good
foundations
of
sﬂection
,
Elizabeth’s
change
of
sentiment
will
be
neither
improbable
nor
faulty
.
But
if
otherwise
—
if
the
regard
springing
from
such
sources
is
unreasonable
or
unnatural
,
in
comparison
of
what
is
so
often
described
as
arising
on
a
ﬁrst
interview
with
its
object
,
and
even
before
two
words
have
been
exchanged
,
—
nothing
can
be
said
in
her
defence
,
except
that
she
had
given
somewhat
of
a
trial
to
the
latter
method
in
her
partiality
for
Wickham
,
and
that
its
ill
success
might
,
perha
authorize
her
to
seek
the
other
less
interesting
mode
orattachment
.
Be
that
as
it
may
,
the
saw
him
go
with
regret
;
and
in
this
early
exam
le
of
what
Lydia’s
infamy
must
produce
,
found
additional
anguish
as
she
reﬂected
on
that
wretched
business
.
Never
,
since
reading
Jane’s
second
letter
,
had
she
entertained
a
hope
of
Wickham’s
meaning
to
marry
her
.
No
one
but
Jane
,
she
thought
,
could
ﬂatter
herself
with
such
an
expectation
.
Surprize
was
the
least
of
her
feelin
s
on
this
develo
ment
.
While
the
contents
of
the
first
letter
remai
on
her
mind
,
she
was
all
su
rile
—
all
astonishment
that
Wickham
should
marry
a
gilllj
whom
it
was
im
ible
he
could
marry
for
money
;
and
how
Lydia
coul
ever
have
attached
him
had
a
peared
incomprehensible
.
But
now
it
was
all
too
natu
.
For
such
an
attachment
as
this
she
might
have
sufﬁcient
charms
;
and
though
she
did
not
suppose
Lydia
to
be
deliberately
engaging
in
an
elopement
without
the
intention
of
marriage
,
she
had
no
difﬁculty
in
believing
that
96
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.
neither
her
virtue
nor
her
understanding
would
preserve
her
from
falling
an
easy
prey
.
She
had
never
perceived
,
while
the
regiment
was
in
Hertfordshire
,
that
Lydia
had
any
partialin
for
him
;
but
she
was
convinced
that
L
dia
had
wanted
only
encouragement
to
attach
herselfy
to
anybody
.
Sometimes
one
oﬂicer
,
sometimes
another
,
had
been
her
favourite
,
in
their
attentions
raised
them
in
her
opinion
.
Her
affections
had
been
continually
ﬂuctuating
,
but
never
without
an
object
.
The
mischief
of
neglect
and
mistaken
indulgence
towards
such
a
girl
—
oh
!
how
acutely
did
she
now
feel
it
!
She
was
wild
to
be
at
home
—
to
hear
,
to
see
,
to
be
upon
the
spot
to
share
with
Jane
in
the
cares
that
must
now
fall
wholly
upon
her
,
in
a
family
so
deranged
,
a
father
absent
,
a
mother
incapable
of
exertion
,
and
requiring
constant
attendance
;
and
though
almost
.
persuaded
that
nothing
could
be
done
for
Lydia
,
her
uncle’s
interference
seemed
of
the
utmost
importance
,
and
till
he
entered
the
room
the
misery
of
her
impatience
was
severe
.
Mr
and
Mrs
Gardiner
had
hun-ied
back
in
alarm
,
supposing
by
the
servant’s
account
that
their
niece
was
taken
suddenly
ill
;
—
—
hut
satisfying
them
instantly
on
that
head
,
she
eagerly
communicated
the
cause
of
their
summons
,
reading
the
two
letters
aloud
,
and
dwelling
on
the
postscript
of
the
last
with
trembling
energy
.
Though
Lydia
had
never
been
a
favourite
with
them
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Gardiner
could
not
but
be
deeply
affected
.
Not
Lydia
only
,
but
all
were
concerned
in
it
;
and
after
the
ﬁrst
exclamatious
of
surprize
and
horror
,
Mr
Gardiner
readily
promised
every
assistance
in
his
power
.
Elizabeth
,
though
expecting
no
less
,
thanked
him
with
tears
of
gratitude
;
and
all
three
being
actuated
by
one
spirit
,
everything
relating
to
their
journey
was
speedily
settled
.
They
were
to
be
OK
as
soon
as
possible
.

is

repeated
the

,
as
she
ran
into

to
prepare
.
“And

upon
such
terms
as
for
her
to
disclose
the
real
truth
?
Oh
,
that
I
knew
how
it
was
!
”
But
wishes
were
vain
,
or
at
best
could
serve
only
to
amuse
her
in
the
hurry
and
confusion
of
the
following
hour
.
Had
Elizabeth
been
at
leisure
to
be
idle
,
she
would
have
remained
certain
that
.
all
employment
was
impossible
to
one
so
wretched
as
herself
;
but
she
had
her
share
of
business
as
well
as
her
aunt
,
and
amongst
the
rest
there
were
notes
to
be
written
to
all
their
friends
at
Lambton
,
with
false
excuses
for
their
sudden
departure
.
An
hour
,
however
,
saw
the
whole
completed
;
and
Mr
Gardiner
meanwhile
havin
settled
his
account
at
the
inn
,
nothing
remained
to
be
one
but
to
go
;
and

Elizabeth
,
after
all
the
misery
of
the
morning
,
found
herself

in
a
shorter
space
of
time

could
have
supposed

seated
in

on

I

It
appears
to
me
so
very
unlikely
that
any
young
man
should
form
such
a
design
against
a
girl
who
is
by
no

who
was
actually
staying

Not
,
perhaps
,
of
neglecting
his

;
but
of
every
other
neglect
I
can
believe
him
capable
.
If
,
indeed
,
it
should
be
so
!
But
I
dare
not
hope
it
.
Why
should
they
not
go
on
to
Scotland
,
if
that
had
been
the
case
I
"
“
In
the
ﬁrst
place
,
”
replied
Mr
Gardiner
,
“there
is
no
absolute
proof
that
they
are
not
gone
to
Scotland.”
“Oh
!
but
their
removing
from
the
chaise
into
an
hackney
coach
is
such
a
presumption
!
And
,
besides
,
no
traces
of
them
were
to
be
found
on
the
Barnct
road.”
“Well
,
then
—
supposing
them
to
be
in
London
.
They
may
be
there
,
though
for
the
purpose
of
concealment
,
for
no
more
exceptional
purpose
.
It
is
not
likely
that
money
should
be
very
abundant
on
either
side
;
and
it
might
strike
them
that
they
could
be
more
economically

married

than
in

am

But
as
to
your
other
objection
,
I
am
afraid
it
will
hardly
hold
good
.
Lydia
has
no
brothers
to
forward
;
and
he
might
imagine
,
from
my
father’s
be
aviour
,
from
his
indolence

he

'
“
But
can
you
think
that
Lydia
is
so
lost
to
everything
but
love
of
him
as
to
consent
to
live
with
him
on
any
other
terma
than
marriage
?
"
“It
does
seem
,
and
it
is
most
shocking
indeed
,
'
replied
Elizabeth
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
“
that
s
sister’s
sense
of
decency
and
virtue
in
such
a
point
should
admit
of
doubt
.
But
,
really
,
I
know
not
what
to
say
.
Perhaps
I
am
not
doing
her
justice
.
But
she
is
very
young
;
she
has
never
been
taught
to
think
on
serious
subjects
;
and
for
the
last
half-year
—
nay
,
for
a
twelvemonth
—
she
has
been
given
up
to
nothing
but
amusement
and
vanity
.
She
has
been
allowed
to
dispose
of
her
time
in
the
most
idle
and
frivolous
manner
,
and
to
adopt
any
opinions
that
came
in
her
way
.
Since
the

were
ﬁrst
oartered
in
Merytnn
,
nothing
but
love
,
ﬂirtation
,
and
oﬁioers
have
been
in
her
head
.
She
has
been
doing
everything
in
her
power
by
thinking
and
talking
on
the
subject
,
to
give
greater
—
what
shall
I
call
it
?
susceptibility
to
her
feelings
;
which
are
naturally
lively
enough
.

that

has
every

that

“

you
see
that

laid
her
aunt
,
“does
not

ill

as

?

Mrs

,

"
I
told
you
,
the
other
day
,
of
his
infamous
behaviour
to
Mr
Darcy
;
and
you
yourself
,
when
last
at
Longhourn
,
heard
in
what
manner
he
spoke
of
the
man
who
had
behaved
with
such
forbearance
and
liberality
towards
him
.
And
there
are
other
circumstances
which
I
am
not
at
liberty
—
which
it
is
not
worth
while
to
relate
;
but
his
lies
about
the
whole
Pemherley
family
are
endless
.
From
what
he
said
of
Miss
Darcy
,
I
was
thoroughly
grepared
to
see
a
proud
,
reserved
,
disagreeable
girl
.
et
he
knew
to
the
contrary
himself
.
He
must
know
that
she
was
as
amiable
and
unpretending
as
we
have
found
her.”
“But
does

can
she
be
ignorant

what
you
and

so
well
to

”
“Oh
yeti
—
that
,
that
is
the
worst
of
all
.
Till
I
was
in
Kent
,
and
saw
so
much
both
of
Mr
Darcy
and
his

Colonel
Fitzwilliarn

I

was
to

As
that
was
the
case
,
neither
Jane
,
to
whom
I
related
the
whole

I
,
thought
it
necessary

that

the

never

me

That

When

no

Not

I
can
remember
no
symptom
of
aﬁ'ection
on
either
side
;

had
anything
of
the
kind
been
perceptible
,
you
must
be

not

When
lint
he
entered
the
corps
,
she
was
ready
enough
to
admire
him
;
but
so
we
all
were
.
Every
girl
in
or
near
Meryton
was
out
of
her
senses
about
him
for
the
ﬁrst
two
months
;
but
he
never
distinguished
Iver
by
any
particular
attention
;
and
,
consequently
,
after
a
moderate
period
of
extravagant
and
wild
admiration
,
her
fancy
for
him
gave
way
,
and
others
of
the
regiment1
who
treated
her
with
more
distinction
,
again
became
her
favourites.”
It
may
be
easily
believed
,
that
however
little
of
novelty
could
be
added
to
their
fears
,
hopes
,
and
conjectures
,
on
this
interesting
subject
,
by
its
repeated
discussion
,
no
other
could
detain
them
from
it

,
during
the
whole
of
the
journey

They
travelled
as
expeditiously
as
possible
,
and
,
sleeping
one
night
on
the
road
,
reached
Longbourn
by
dinner-time
the
next
day
.
It
was
a
comfort
to
Elinbeth
to
consider
that
Jane
could
not
have
been
wearied
long
ex
tionl
.

by
the

of

of
the

as
they
entered
the
paddock
;
and
,
when
the
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door
,
the
joyful
surprize
that
li
hted
up
their
faces
,

diaplayed
itself
over
their

e
bodies
,
in
a
variety
of
capers
and
(
risks
,
was
the
ﬁrst
pleasing
meet
of
their
welcome
.
Elizabeth
jumped
out
;
and
,
after
giving
each
of
them
an
hasty
kiss
,
hunied
into
the
vestibule
,
where
Jane
,
who
came
mnning
downstairs
from
her
mother’s
apartment
,
immediately
met
her
.
Elizabeth
,
as
she
afl'eCtionately
embraced
her
,
whilst
tears
ﬁlled
the
eyes
of
both
,
lost
not
a
moment
in
asking
whether
anything
had
been
heard
of
the
fugitives
.
’
“
Not

replied
Jane
.
“
But
now

,
to
say
that
he

and
to
give

I
particularly
begged

"
Her
sister
,
however
,
natured
her
of
her
being
perfectly
well
;
and
their
conversation
,
which
had
been
ng
while
Mr
and
Mn
Gardiner
were
engaged
wi
their
children
,
was
now
put
an
end
to
by
the
approach
of
the
whole
party
.
Jane
ran
to
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
and
welcomed
and
dunked
them
both
,
with
alternate
smile
!
and
tears
.
When
were
all
in
the
drawing-room
,
the
queetions
which
liznbeth
had
already
asked
were
of
course
repeated
by
the
others
,
and
they
noon
found
that
Jane
had
no
intelligence
to
give
.
The
sanguine
hope
of
good
,
however
,
which
the
benevolence
of
her
heart
suggested
had
not
et
deserted
her
;
she
still
expected
that
it
would
all
endy
well
,
and
that
every
morning
would
bring
some
letter
,
either
from
Lydia
or
her
father
,
to
explain
their
proceedings
,
and
,
perhaps
,
announce
the
marriage
.
Mrs
Bennet
,
to
whoee
apartment
they
all
repaired
,
after
a
few
minutes’
conversation
together
,
received
them
exactly
as
might
be
expected
;
with
tears
and
lamentations
of
regret
,
invectives
against
the
villanous
conduct
of
Wickham
,
and
complaints
of
her
own
suffering
:
and
ill-usage
;
blaming
everybody
but
the
person
to
whole
ill-judging
indulgence

errors

I
can

by

nor
by

.
And
tell
my
dear
Lydia
not
to
give
any
directions
about

till
she
has
seen
me
,
for
she
does

But
Mr
Gardiner
,
though
he
assured
her
again
of
his
earnest
endeavours
in
the
cause
,
could
not
avoid
recommending
moderation
to
her
,
as
well
in
her
hopes
as
her
fears
;
and
after
talking
with
her
in
this
manner
till
dinner
was
on
table
,
they
left
her
to
vent
all
her
feelings
on
the
housekeeper
,
who
attended
,
in
the
absence
of
her
daughters
.
Though
her
brother
and
sister
were
persuaded
that
there
was
no
real
occasion
for
such
a
seclusion
from
the
family
,
they
did
not
attempt
to
oppose
it
,
for
they
knew
that
she
had
not
prudence
enough
to
hold
her
tongue
before
the
servants
,
while
they
waited
at
table
,
and
judged
it
better
that
on
:
only
of
the
household
,
and
the
one
whom
they
could
most
trust
,
should
comprehend
all
her
fears
and
solicitude
on
the
subject
.
In
the
dining-room
they
were
soon
joined
by
Mary
and
Kitty
,
who
had
been
too
busily
engaged
in
their
separate
apartments
to
make
their
appearance
before
.
One
came
from
her
books
,
and
the
other
from
her
toilette
.
The
faces
of
both
,
however
,
were
tolerany
calm
;
and
no
change
was
visible
in
either
,
except
that
the
loss
of
her
favourite
sister
,
or
the
anger
which
she
had
herself
incurred
in
the
business
,
had
given
something
more
of
fretfulness
than
usual
to
the
accents
of
Kitty
.
As
for
Mary
,
she
was
mistress
enough
of
herself

whisper
to
Elizabeth
,
with
a
countenance
of
grave
tellcction
,
won
after
they
were
seated
at
table
—
—
“
This

the

How
was
it

such
an
idea
should
enter
our
brains
I
I
fe
t
a
little
uneasy
—
a
little
fearful
of
my
sister’s
happiness
with
him
in
marriage
,
because
I
knew
that
his
conduct
had
not

right

My
father

knew
nothing

they
only
felt

imprudent

Kitty

owned
,
with
a
very
natural
triumph
on
knowing
more
than
the
rest
of
us
,
that
in
Lydia’s
last
letter
she
had
p
red
her
for
such
a
step
.
She
had
known

it

being

I
must
confess
that
he
did
not

ak
so
well
of
Wickllam
as
he
formerly
did
.
He
be
ieved
him
to
be
imprudent

extravagant

And
since
this
sad
affair
has
taken
place
,
it
is
said
that
he
left
Meryton
greatly
in
debt
;
but
I
hope
this
may
be
false.”

My

came
in
without

him

His

knew
him
to
be

on

occasions
,
a
moat
negligent
and
dilatory
correspondent
;
but
at

such
a

they
had

They

When

they

heir
other

also
visited
them
frequently
,
and
always
,
as
she
said
,
with
the
design
of
cheering
and
heartening
them
tsp
—
though
,
as
she
never
came
without
reporting
some
fresh
instance
of
Wickham’s
extravagance
or
irregularity
,
she
seldom
went
away
without
leaving
them
more
dispirited
than
she
found
them
.
All
Meryton
seemed
striving
to
blacken
the
man
who
,
but
three
months
before
,
had
been
almost
an
angel
of
light
.
He
was
declared
to
be
in
debt
to
every
tradesman
in
the
place
,
and
his
intrigues
,
all
honoured
with
the
title
of
seduction
,
had
been
extended
into
every
tradesman’s
family
.
Everybody
declared
that
he
was
the
wickcdest
young
man
in
the
world
;
and
everybody
began
to
ﬁnd
out
that
they
had
always
distrusted
the
n
pcamncc
of
his
goodness
.
Elizabeth
,
though
she
di
not
credit
above
half
of
what
was
said
,
believed
enough
to
make
her
former
assurance
of
her
sister’s
ruin
still
more
certain
;
and
even
Jane
,
who
believed
still
less
of
it
,
became
almost
hopeless
,
more
especially
as
the
time
was
now
come
when
,
if
they
had
gone
to
Scotland
,
which
she
had
never
before
entirely
despaired
of
,
they
must
in
all
probability
have
gained
some
news
of
them
.
Mr
Gardiner
left
Longbourn
on
Sunday
;
on
Tuesday
,
his
wife
received
a
letter
from
him
:
it
told
them
that
,
on
his
arrival
,
he
had
immediately
found
out
his
brother
,
and
persuaded
him
to
come
to
Gracechurch
Street
;
that
Mr
Bennet
had
been
to
Epsom
and
u
:
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.
Clapham
,
before
his
arrival
,
but
without
gaining
any
tisfactory
information
;
and
that
he
was
now
determined
to
inquire
at
all
the
principal
hotels
in
town
,
as
Mr
Bennet
thought
it
possible
they
might
have
gone
to
one
of
them
,
on
their
ﬁrst
coming
to
London
,
before
they
procured
lodgings
.
Mr
Gardiner
himself
did
not
expect
any
success
from
this
measure
,
but
as
his
brother
was
eager
in
it
,
he
meant
to
assist
him
in
pursuing
it
.
He
added
that
Mr
Bennet
seemed
wholly
disinclined
at
present
to
leave
London
,
and
promised
to
Write
again
very
soon
.
There
was
also
a
postscript
to
this
effect
—
“
I
have
written
to
Colonel
Forster
to
desire
him
to
ﬁnd
out
,
if
possible
,
from
some
of
the
young
man’s
intimates
in
the
regiment
,
whether
Wickham
has
any
relations
or
connections
who
would
be
likely
to
know
in
what
part
of
the
town
he
has
now
concealed
himself
.
If
there
were
any
one
that
one
could
apply
to
with
a
probability
of
gaining
such
a
clue
as
that
,
it
might
be
of
essential
conse
uencc
.
At
present
we
have
nothing
to
guide
us
.
Co
onel
Forster
will
,
I
dare
say
.
do
everything
in
his
power
to
satisfy
us
on
this
head
.
But
,
on
second
thoughts
,
perhaps
Lizzy
could
tell
us
what
relations
he
has
now
living
,
better
than
any
other
rson.”
Elizabeth
was
at
no
loss
to
understand
from
whence
this
deference
for
her
authority
proceeded
;
but
it
was
not
in
her
power
to
give
any
information
of
so
satisfactory
a
nature
as
the
compliment
deserved
.
She
had
never
heard
of
his
having
had
any
relations
,
except
a
father
and
mother
,
both
of
whom
had
been
dead
many
years
.
It
was
possible
,
however
,
that
some
of
his
companions
in
the
—
—
-shire
might
be
able
to
give
more
infomiution
;
and
though
she
was
not
very
sanguine
in
expecting
it
,
the
application
was
a
something

PRIDE
AND
PRENDICEII3
Every
day
at
Longbourn
was
now
a
day
of
anxiety
;
but
the
most
anxious
part
of
each
was
when
the
East
was
ex
cted
.
The
arrival
of
letters
was
the
rst
nd
0
ject
of
every
momin
’I
impatience
.
Throu
h
etters
,
whatever
of
good
or
d
was
to
be
told
wou
d
be
communicated
,
and
every
succeeding
day
was
expected
to
bring
some
news
of
importance
.
But
before
they
heard
again
from
Mr
Gardiner
,
a
letter
arrived
for
their
father
,
from
a
different
quarter
,
from
Mr
Collins
;
which
,
as
Jane
had
received
directions
to
a
n
all
that
came
for
him
in
his
absence
,
she
according
y
read
;
and
Elizabeth
,
who
knew
what
curiosities
his
letters
always
were
,
looked
over
her
,
and
read
it
likewise
.
It
was
as
follows
:
—
“
Mr
Dan
.
Sin
,
—
“I
feel
myself
called
upon
,
by
our
relationship
,
and
my
situation
in
life
,
to
condole
with
you
on
the
grievous
aﬂliction
you
are
now
luﬂ'ering
under
,
of
which
we
were
yesterday
infon'ned
by
a
letter
from
Hertfordshire
.
Be
assured
,
my
dear
sir
,
that
Mrs
Collins
and
myself
sincerely
sympathize
with
you
and
all
your
respectable
family
,
in
your
present
distress
,
which
must
be
of
the
bitterest
kind
,
because
proceeding
from
a
cause
which
no
time
can
remove
.
No
arguments
shall
be
wanting
on
my
part
that
can
alleviate
so
severe
a
misfortune
—
or
that
may
comfort
you
,
under
a
circumstance
that
must
be
of
all
others
most
aﬂiicting
to
a
parent’s
mind
.
The
death
of
your
daughter
would
have
been
a
blessing
in
com
rison
of
this
.
And
it
is
the
more
to
be
lamented
,
use
there
is
reason
to
suppose
,
as
my
dear
Charlotte
informs
me
,
that
this
licentiousness
of
behaviour
in
your
daughter
has
proceeded
from
a
faulty
degree
of
indulgence
;
thou
h
,
at
the
same
time
,
for
the
consolation
of
yourself
an
Mrs

I
am
inclined
to
think
that
her
own
disposition

PRIDE
AND

be
naturally
bad
,
or
she
could
not
be
guilty
of
such
an
enormity
,
at
so
early
on
age
.
Howsoever
that
may
be
,
you
are
grievanst
to
be
itied
;
in
which
opinion
I
am
not
only
joined
by
Mrs
ollins
,
but
likewise
by
Lady
Catherine
and
her
daughter
,
to
whom
,
I
have
related
the
affair
.
They
agree
with
me
in
apprehending
that
this
false
step
in
one
daughter
will
be
injurious
to
the
fortunes
of
all
the
others
;
for
who
,
as
Lady
Catherine
herself
condescendineg
says
,
will
connect
themselves
with
such
a
famil
?
And
this
consideration
leads
me
moreover
to
re
ect
,
with
sugmented
satisfaction
,
on
a
certain
event
of
last
November
;
for
had
it
been
otherwise
,
I
must
have
been
involved
in
all
your
sorrow
and
disgrace
.
Let
me
advise
you
then
,
my
dear
sir
,
to
console
yourself
as
much
as
possible
,
to
throw
of
?
your
unworthy
child
from
your
infection
for
ever
,
and
leave
her
to
reap
the
fruits
of
her
own
heinous
offence
—
I
am
,
dear
sir

Mr
Gardiner
did
not
write
again
till
he
had
received
an
answer
from
Colonel
Forster
;
and
then
he
had
nothing
of
a
pleasant
nature
to
send
.
It
was
not
known
that
Wickham
had
a
single
relation
with
whom
he
kept
up
any
connection
,
and
it
was
cenain
that
he
had
no
near
one
living
.
His
former
acquaintance
had
been
numerous
;
but
since
he
had
been
in
the
militia
,
it
did
not
appear
that
he
was
on
terms
of
particular
friendship
with
any
of
them
.
There
was
no
one
,
therefore
,
who
could
be
pointed
out
as
likely
to
give
any
news
of
him
.
And
in
the
wretched
state
of
his
own
ﬁnances
,
there
was
a
very
powerful
motive
for
secrecy
,
in
addition
to
his
fear
of
discovery
by
Lydia’
s
relations
,
for
it
had
just
transpired
that
he
had
left
gaming
debts
behind
him
to
a
very
considerable
amount
.

Mr
Gardiner
added
in
hie
letter
,
that
they
might
expect
to
lee
their
father
at
home
on
the
following
da
,
which
was
Saturday
.
Rendered
apiritleu
by
the
ill

rucceu
of
all
their
endeavoun
,
he
had
yielded
to
his
hrother-in-law’l
entraty
that
he
would
return
to
his
family
,
and
leave
it
to
him
to
do
whatever
occasion
might
suggest
to
be
advisable
for
continuing
their
pursuit

When
Mrs
Bennet
was
told
of
thin
,
ahe
did
not
express
so
much
aatiafaction
as
her
children
expected
,
considering
what
her
anxiety
for
hie
life
had
been
before
.
“What
,
in
he
coming
home
,
and
without
poor
Lydia
?
”
she
cried
.
“
Sure
he
will
not
leave
London
before
he
has
found
them
.
Who
is
to
light
Wickham
,
and
make
him
marry
her
,
if
he
comes
away
?
”
As
Mn
Gardiner
began
to
wish
to
he
at
home
,
it
was
reuled
that
she
and
her
children
should
go
to
London
,
at
the
same
time
that
Mr
Bennet
came
from
it
.
The
coach
,
therefore
,
took
them
the
first
stage
of
their
journey
,
and
brought
in
master
back
to
Longhourn
.
Mn
Gardiner
went
away
in
all
the
perplexity
about
Elizabeth
and
her
Derbyahire
friend
that
had
attended
her
from
that
rt
of
the
world
.
His
name
had
never
been
voluntariy
mentioned
before
them
by
her
niece
;
and
the
kind
of
half-expectation
which
Mn
Gardiner
had
formed
,
of
their
being
followed
by
a
letter
from
him
,
had
ended
in
nothing
.
Elizabeth
had
received
none
since
her
retum
that
could
come
from
Pemberley
.
The
present
unhappy
state
of

family

for

:
unnecessary
;
nothing
,
therefore
,
could
be
fairly
conjectured
from
that
.
though
Elizabeth

was

When

arrived
,
he
had

He
aid
at

at

made
no

of
the

that
had
taken

away
,
and
it
was
tome
time
before
hll
daughten
had
courage
to
speak
of
it
.
It
wan
not
till
the
afternoon
,
when
he
joined
them
at
tea
,
that
Elizabeth
ventured
to
introduce
the
subject
;
and
then
,
on
her
brieﬂy
expressing
her
IOITOVI
for
what
he
must
have
endured
,
he
replied
,
“

“You

replied
Elizabeth
.
“

she
said
to
Miss

,

but
I
was
in

He
has
been
here
this
halfohour

and
master
has
had
a
letter.”
Away
ran
the
girls
,
too
eager
to
get
in
to
have
time
for
speech
.
They
ran
through
the
vestibule
into
the
breakfast~room
;
from
thence
to
the
library
;

tbeir

was
in
neither

they
were
on
the
point
of
seeking
him
upstairs
with
their
mother

when
they
were
met
by
the
butler

who
said
—
“
If
you
are
looking
for
my
master

ma’am
,
he
is
walking
towards
the
little
copse.”
Upon
this
infomation

they
instantly
passed
through
the
hall
once
more

ran
across
the
lawn
after
their
father

who
was
deliberately
pursuing
his
way
towards
a
small
wood
on

side

soon
lagged
behind
,
while
her

panting
for

came
up
with
him

and
agerly
cried
out

At

such
as

upon

whole
,
I
hope
will
give'
on
satisfaction

Soon
after
you
left
me
on

was
fortunate
enough
to
ﬁnd
out
in
what
part
of
London
they
were
.
The
particulars

we

it

enough
to

them

Then
it
is
as
I
always
hoped

cried

;
“
they
are

Elizabeth
read
on
—
“
I
have

I
can
ﬁnd
there
was
any
intention

if

perform
the
engagementl

I
have
ventured
to
make
on
your
side
,
I
ho
e
it
will
not
be
long
before
they
are
.
All
that
is
required
of
you
in
,
to
assure
to
your
daugther
,
by

her
equal
share
of
the
ﬁve
thousand
pounds
secured
among
your
children
after
the
decease
of
yourself

and
,
moreover
,
to
enter
into
an
engagement
of
allowing
her
,
during
your
life
,
one
hundred
pounds
per
annum

These
are
conditions
which
,
considering
everything
,
I
had
no
hesitation
in
complying
with
,
as
far
as
I
thought
myself

I
shall
send

that
no

may
be
lost

bringing
me

You
will
easily
comprehend
,
from
these
particulars
,
that
Mr
Wickham’s
circumstances
are
not
so
hopeless
as
they
are
generally
believed
to
he
.
The

has
been

have
judged
it
beet
that

I

There

But
there
are
two
things
that
I

to

is
,
how

it

distressed
himself

A

could
not
do
all
this

“
No

her
father
;
“

“Ten

'
Mr
Bennet
made
no
answer
,
and
each
of
them
,
deep
in
thought
,
continued
silent
till
they
reached
the
house

Their
father
then
went
to
the

so
write

and
the
girls
walked
into
the
breakfast-room

And
they

to

cried
Elinbeth
,
as
soon
as

were
by

this
is

rbi
:
we

I
comfort

“
that
he

Though
our

done
something
towards
clearing
him
,
I
can
not

that
ten

anything

,

“If
we
were
ever
able
to
learn
what
Wiekham's

have
been

said
Elizabeth

“
and
how

is

such

not

“We
must
endeavour
to
forget
all
that
has
passed
on
either
side
,
'
said
Jane
:
“
I
hope
and
trust
they
will
et
be
happy
.
His
consenting
to
marry
her
is
a
proof
,
will
believe
,
that
he
is
come
to
a
right
way
of
thinking
.
Their
mutual
affection
will
steady
them
;
and
I
ﬂatter
myself
they
will
settle
so
quietly
,
and
live
in
so
rational
a
manner
,
as
may
in

make
their
past
imprudence

“Their
conduct
has
been
such
,
”
replied
Elizabeth
,
“as
neither
you
,
nor
I
,
nor
anybody
can
ever

It
is
useless
to

of

'
It
now
occurred
to
the
girls
that
their
mother
was
in
all
likelihood
perfectly
ignorant
of
what
had
happened
.
They
went
to
the
library
,
therefore
,
and
asked
their
father
whether
he
would
not
wish
them
to

it

Mrs

could
hardly

herself

As

had
read
Mr
Gardiner’s

of
Lydia’s
being
soon
married
,
her
joy
burst
forth
,
and
every

sentence
added
to
its
exuberance
.
She
was
now
in
an
irritation
as
violent
from
delight
,
as
she
had
ever
been
ﬁdgety
from
alarm
and
vexation
.
To
know
that

was
enough
.
She
was
disturbed
by
no

her
felicity
,
nor
humbled
by
any
remembrance
of
her
misconduct

“

Poor
Lydia’s
situation
must
,
at
best
,
be
bad
enough
;
but
that
it
was
no
worse
,
she
had
need
to

She
felt
it
so
;
and
though

,
neither

nor

could
be

expected
or
her

in

R
BENNET
had
very
often
wished
before
this
period
of
his
life
that
,
instead
of
spending
his
whole
income
,
he
had
laid
by
an
annual
sum
for
the
better
provision
of
his
children
,
and
of
his
wife
,
if
she
survived
him
.
He
now
wished
it
more
than
ever
.
Had
he
done
his
duty
in
that
respect
,
Lydia
need
not
have
been
indebted
to
her
uncle
for
whatever
of
honour
or
credit
could
now
be
purchased
for
her
.
The
satisfaction
of
prevailing
on
one
of
the
most
worthless
young
men
in
Great
Britain
to
be
her
husband
might
then
have
rested
in
its
proper
place
.
He
was
seriously
concerned
that
a
cause
of
so
little
advantage
to
anyone
should
be
forwarded
at
the
sole
expense
of
his
brother-in-law
,
and
he
was
determined
,
if
possible
,
to
ﬁnd
out
the
extent
of
his
assistance
,
and
to
discharge
the
obligation
as
soon
as
he
could
.
When
ﬁrst
Mr
Bennet
had
married
,
economy
was
held
to
be
perfectly
useless
;
for
,
of
course
,
they
were
to
have
a
son
.
This
son
was
to
join
in
cutting
off
the
entail
,
as
soon
as
he
should
be
of
age
,
and
the
widow
and
younger
children
would
by
that
means
be
provided
for
.
Five
daughters
successively
entered
the
world
,
but
yet
the
son
was
to
come
;
and
Mrs
Bennet
,
for
many
years
after
Lydia’s
birth
,
had
been
certain
that
he
would
.
"

PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.
This
event
had
at
last
been
d
red
of
,
but
it
was
then
too
late
to
be
saving
.
Mrs
ennet
had
no
turn
for
economy
,
and
her
husband’s
love
of
independence
had
alone
prevented
their
exceeding
their
income
.
Five
thousand
pounds
was
settled
by
marriage
articles
on
Mrs
Bennet
and
the
children
.
But
in
what
proportions
it
should
be
divided
amongst
the
latter
depended
on
the
will
of
thc
aients
.
This
was
one

oint
,
with
regard
to
Lydia
,
at
can
,
which
was
now
to
he
setded
,
and
Mr
Bennet
could
have
no
hesitation
in
acceding
to
the
proposal
before
him
.
In
terms
of
grateful
acknowledgment
for
the
kindness
of
his
brother
,
though
expressed
molt
concisely
,
he
then
delivered
on
paper
his
perfect
ap
robation
of
all
that
was
done
,
and
his
willin
nest
to
fuliil
the
engagements
that
had

He

by

was

Welcome
su
rile
;
for
his
wish
at
present
was
to
have
as
little
tro
le
in
the
business
as
possible
.
When
the
ﬁrst
transports
of
rage
which
had
produced
his
activity
in
seeking
her
were
over
,
he
naturally
returned
to
all
his
former
indolence
.
His
letter
was
soon
despatched
;
for
,
though
dilatory
in
undertaking
business
,
he
was
quick
in
its
execution
.
He
begged
to
know
further
particulars
of
what
he
was
indebted
to
hil
brother
,
but
was
too
angry
wid

Lydia
to
send

message
to

and
with

speed
through

neighbourhood
.
It
was

:
the
latter
with
decent
philosophy
.
To
be
sure
,
it
would
have
been
more
for
the
advantage
of
conversation
had
Miss
L
dia
Bennet
come
upon
the
town
;
or
,
as
the
hap
iest
temative
,
been
secluded
from
the
world
,
in
some
distant
farm-house
.
But
there
was
much
to
be
talked
of
in
marrying
her
;
and
the
gOOdnatured
wishes
for
her
well-doing
which
had
proceeded
before
from
all
the
spiteful
old
ladies
in
Meryton
lost
but
little
of
their
spirit
in
this
change
of
circumstances
,
because
with
such
an
husband
her
misery
was
considered
certaln
.
It
was
a
fortnight
since
Mrs
Bennet
had
been
downstairs
;
but
on
this
happy
day
she
again
took
her
seat
at
the
head
of
her
table
,
and
in
spirits
oppressiver
high
.
No
sentiment
of
shame
gave
a
damp
to
her
trium
h
.
The
marriage
of
a
daughter
,
which
had
been
the
rst
object
of
her
wishes
since
Jane
was
sixteen
,
was
now
on
the
point
of
accomplishment
,
and
her
thoughts
and
her
words
ran
wholly
on
those
attendants
of
elegant
nuptials
,
line
muslins
,
new
carriages
,
and
servants
.
She
was
busin
searching
through
the
neighbourth
for
a
proper
situation
for
her
daughter
,
and
,
without
knowrng
or
considering
what
their
income
might
be
,
rejected
many
as
deﬁcient
in
size
and
importance
.
“Haye
Park
might
do
,
”
said
she
,
“if
the
Gouldings
would
quit
it
—
or
the
great
house
at
Stoke
,
if
the
drawingdoom
were
larger

but
Ashworth

not
bear
to
have
her
ten
miles
from
me
;
and
as
for
Pun/is
Lodge
,
the
attics
are
dreadful.”
Her
husband
allowed
her
to
talk
on
without
interrup«
tion
while
the
servants
remained
.
But
when
they
had
withdrawn
,
he
said
to
her
,
“

,

PRIDE
AND

.
129
From
such
a
connection
she
could
not
wonder
that
he
should
shrink
.
The
wish
of
procuring
her
regard
,
which
she
had
assured
herself
of
his
feeling
in
Derbysbire
,
could
not
in
rational
expectation
survive
such
a
blow
us
this
.
She
was
humbled
,
the
was
grieved
;
the
repented
,
though
she
hardly
knew
of
what
.
She
became
ﬁalous
of
his
esteem
,
when
the
could
no
longer
hope
to
beneﬁted
by
it
.
She
wanted
to
hear
of
him
,
when
there
seemed
the
least
chance
of
gaining
intelligence
.
She
was
convinced
that
she
could
have
been
happy
with
him
;
when
it
was
no
longer
likely
they
should
meet
.
What
a
triumph
for
him
,
as
she
often
thought
,
could
he
know
that
the
proposals
which
she
had
proudly
spprned
only
four
months
ago
,
would
now
have
been
g
(
ﬂy
and
gratefully
received
!
He
was
as
generous
,
she
doubted
not
,
as
the
most
generous
of
his
sex
;
but
while
he
was
mortal
,
there
must
be
a
triumph
.
She
began
now
to
com
rehend
that
he
was
exactly
the
man

,
in
disposition

talents

would
most
suit
her
.
His
understanding
and
temper
,
though
unlike
her
own
,
would
have
answered
all
her
wishes
.
It
was
an
union
that
must
have
been
to
the
advantage
of
both
:
by
her
case
and
liveliness
,
his
mind
might
have
been
softened
,
his
manners
improved
;
and
from
his
judgment
,
infonmtion
,
and
knowledge
of
the
world
,
she
must
have
received
beneﬁt
of
greater
importance
.
But
no
such
happy
marriage
could
now
teach
the
admiring
multitude
what
connubial
felicity
really
was
.
An
union
of
:
different
tendency
,
and
precluding
the
possibility
of
the
other
,
was
soon
to
be
formed
in

How
Wickham

Lydia
were
to

in

independence
,
she
could
not
imagine
.
But
how
little
of
permanent
happiness
could
belong
to
a
couple
who
were
only
brought
together
because
their
passions
were
stronger
than
their
virtue

she
could
easily

concluded
with

that

Mr

all
the

Wickham’s
removal
from

clearly
as
Mr

Mrs

was
not

pleasure

In

com

,
for
she
had
by
no

given
up
her
plan
of
their
residing
in
Hertfordshire
,
was
a
severe
disintment
;
and
,
besides
,
it
was
such
a
pity
that
Lydia
should
be
taken
from
a
re

where
she
was
acquainted
with
everybody
,
and
has

so
many
favourites

said
she

“
it

HEIR
sister’s
wedding-day
arrived
;
and
Jane
and
Elizabeth
felt
for
her
.
probably
more
than
she
felt
for
herself
.
The
carriage
was
sent
to
meet
them
at
,
and
they
were
to
return
in
it
by
dinner-time
.
Their
arrival
was
dreaded
by
the
elder
Miss
Bennets
,
and
Jane
more
eupecially
,
who
gave
Lydia
the
feelings
which
would
have
attended
herself
,
had
:5
:
been
the
culprit
,
and
was
wretched
in
the
thought
of
what
her
sister
must
endure
.
They
came
.
The
family
were
assembled
in
the
breakfast-room
to
receive
them
.
Smiles
decked
the
face
of
Mrs
Bennet
as
the
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door
;
her
husband
looked
impenetrably
grave
;
her
daughters
,
alarmed
,
anxious
,
uneasy
.
Lydia’s
voice
was
heard
in
the
vestibule
;
the
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
she
ran
into
the
room
.
Her
mother
stepped
forwards
,
embraced
her
,
and
welcomed
her
with
rapture
;
gave
her
hand
with
an
affectionate
smile
to
Wickham
,
who
followed
his
lady
,
and
wished
diern
both
joy
,
with
an
alacrity
which
showed
no
doubt
of
their
appiness
.
Their
reception
from
Mr
Bennet
,
to
whom
they
then
turned
,
was
not
quite
so
cordial
.
His
countenance
rather
ained
in
austerity
,
and
he
scarcely
opened
his
li
s.
lg‘he
easy
assurance
of
the
oung
couple

ind
,
was
enough
to
provoke
him
.
ﬁliubeth
was
disgusted

and
even
Miss
Bennet
was
shocked
.
Lydia
was
Lydia
still
,
—
untamed
,
unabashed
,
wild
,
noisy
,
and
fearless
.
She
turned
from
sister
to
sister
,
demanding
their
congratulations
;
and
when
at
length
they
all
sat
:
down
,
looked
eagerly
round
the
room
,
took
notice
of
some
little
alteration
in
it
,
and
observed
,
with
a
laugh
,
that
it
was
a
great
while
since
she
had
been
there

Wiekham
was
not
at
all
more
distressed
than
herself
3
but
his
manners
were
always
so
pleasing
,
that
had
his
character
and
his
marriage
been
exactly
what
they
ought
,
his
smiles
and
his
easy
address
,
while
he
claimed
their
relationship
,
would
have
delighted
them
all
.
Elizabeth
had
not
before
believed
him
quite
equal
to
such
assurance
;
but
she
sat
down
,
resolving
within
herself
to
draw
no
limits
in
future
to
the
impudence
of
an
impudent
man
.
She
blushed
,
and
Jane
blushed
;
but
the
cheeks
of
the
two
who
caused
their
confusion
sulfered
no
variation
of
colour
.
There
was
no
want
of
discourse
.
The
bride
and
her
mother
could
neither
of
them
talk
fast
enough
;
and
Wickham
,
who
happened
to
sit
near
Elizabeth
,
began
inquiring
after
his
acquaintancein
that
neighbourhood
with
a
good-humoured
easeswhich
she
felt
very
unable
to
equal
in
her
replies
.
They
seemed
each
of
them
to
have
the
happiest
memories
in
the
world
.
Nothing
of
the
past
was
recolleeted
with
gain
;
and
Lydia
led
voluntarily
to
subjects
which
her
sisters
would
not
have
alluded
to
for
the
world
.
“Only
think
of
its
being
three
months
,
”
she
cried
,
“
since
I
went
away
!
It
seems
but
a
fortnight
,
I
declare
;
and
yet
there

Good

I
am

no

I
thought
it
would
be

ifI
was

'
er
father
lifted
up
his
eyes

Jane
was
distressed
,
Eliubeth
looked
expressively
at
Lydia
;
but
she
,
who
never
heard
nor
saw
anything
of
which
she
chose
to
be
insensible
,
gaily
continued
—
“Oh

mamma
,
do
the
peoPle
hereabouts
know
I
am
married
to-day
?
I
was
afraid
they
might
not
;
and
we
overtook
William
Goulding
in
his
curricle
,
so
I
was
determined
he
should
know
it
,
and
so
I
let
down

She
got
up
and
ran
out
of

and
retumed
no
more
till
she
heard
them
paling
through
the
hall
to
the

She
then
joined
them
soon

on
that

Lydia
that
embarrassment
from
which
she
had
been
so
wholly
free
at

Her
ease
and
good
spirits
increased
.
She
longed
to

the

to

,
in

she
went
after
dinner
to
show
her
ring
,
and
boast
of
being
married
,
to
Mrs
Hill
and
the
two
housemaids

“Well

she

“I
should

'
said

“
And

Mr

had
received

he
was
to
join

regiment
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
.
'
No
one
but
Mrs
Bonnet
regretted
that
their
stay
would
be
so
short
;
and
she
made
the
most
of
the
time
,
by
visiting
about
with
her
daughter
,
and
having
very
frequent
rties
at
home
.
These
parties
were
acceptable
to

l
:
to
avoid
a
family
circle
was
even
more
desirable
to
such
as
did
think
,
than
such
as
did
not
.
Wickham’s
affection
for
Lydia
was
just
what
Elizabeth
had
expected
to
ﬁnd
it
—
not
equal
to
Lydia
s
for
him
.
She
had
scarcely
needed
her
resent

be
satisfied
,
from
the
reason
0
things
,
that
their
elopement
had
been
brought
on
by
the
strength
of
her
love
rather
than
by
his
;
and
she
would
have
wondered
why
,
without
violently
caring
for
her
,
he
chose
to
elope
with
her
at
all
,
had
she
not
felt
certain
that
his
ﬂight
was
rendered
necessary
by
distress
of
circumstances
;
and
if
that
were
the
case
,
he
was
not
the
young
man
to
resist
an
opportunity
of
having
a
companion
.
Lydia
was
exceedingly
fond
of
him
.
He
was

I
longed
to

whether

you

my

But
,

,

again
in

then

all

“

!
"
repented
Elizabeth
,
in
utter
amazement
.
“
Oh
,
yes
l
—
he
was
to
come
there
with
Wickham
,
you
know

But
,
gracious
me
!
I
quite

!
I
ought
not
to
have
said
a
word
about
it

I
promised
them
so
faithfully
!
What
will
Wickham
say
?
It
was
to
be
such
a

!
”
"
If
it
was
to
be
a

,
”
said
Jane
,
“say
not
another
word
on
the
subject
.
You
may
depend
upon
my
seeking
no
further.”
“
Oh
!

”
said
Eliubeth
,
though
burning
with
curiosity
;
“
we
will
ask
you
no
questions
.
'
“

said
L

;
“
for
,
if
ou
did
,
I
should
certainly
tell
you
al
,
and
then
Wicliham
would
be
so
angry.”
On
such
encouragement
to
ask
,
Elihbcth
was
forced
to
ml
it
out
of
her
power
,
by
running
away
.
ut
to
live
in
ignorance
on
such
a
point
was
impossible
;
or
,
at
least
,
it
was
impossible
not
to
try
for
information
.
Mr
Darcy
had
been
at
her
sister’s
wedding
.
It
was
exactly
a
scene
,
and
exactly
among
people
,
where
he
had
apparently
least
to
do
,
and
least
tern
tation
to
go

Conjectures
as
to
the
meaning
of
it
,
rapid
and
wild
,
hurried
into
her
brain
;
but
she
was
satisﬁed
with
none
.
Those
that
best
pleased
her
,
as
placing
his
conduct
in

,
seemed
most
improbable
.
She
could
not
hear
such
suspense
;
and
hastily
seizinga
sheet
of
paper
,
wrote
a
short
letter
to
her

an
explanation
of

as

.
But
if
you
are
really
innocent
and
ignorant
,
I
must
be
more
explicit
“
On
the
ve
day
of
my
coming
home
from
Longboum
,
your
one
e
had
a
most
unexpected
visitor
.
Mr
Darcy
called
,
and
was
shut
up
with
him
several
hours
.
It
wan
all
over
before
I
arrived
;
so
my
curiosity
was
not
so
dreadfnll
racked
aeyaur
:
seems
to
have
been
.
He
came
to
tell
r
Gardiner
that
he
had
found
out
where
your
sister
and
Mr
Wickham
were
.
and
that
he
had
seen
and
talked
with
them
both
—
Wickham
repeatedly
,
Lydia
once
.
From
what
I
can
collect
,
he
left
Derbyshire
only
one
day
after
ourselvu
,
and
came
to
town
with
the
resolution
of
hunting
for
them
.
The
motive
professed
was
his
conviction
of
its
being
owing
to
himself
that
Wickham’s
worthlescnese
had
not
been
so
well
known
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
any
young
woman
of
character
to
love
or
conﬁde
in
him
.
He
generously
imted
the
whole
to
his
mistaken
pride
,
and
confeued
that
he
had
before
thought
it
beneath
him
to
lay
his
private
actions
open
to
the
world
.
His
character
was
to
epeak
for
itself
.
He
called
it
,
therefore
,
his
duty
to
step
forward
,
and
endeavour
to
remedy
an
evil
which
had
been
brought
on
by
himself
.
If
he
bad
number
motive
,
I
am
sure
it
would
never
disgrace
him
.
He
had
been
some
days
in
town
before
he
was
able
to
diecover
them
;
but
he
had
something
to
direct
hie
search
,
which
was
more
than
we
had
;
and
the
consciouaneu
of
this
was
another
reason
for
his
resolving
to

PRIDE
AND

“
There
is
a
lady
,
it
seems
,
a
Mrs
Younge
,
who
was
some
time
ago
governess
to
Miss
Darcy
,
and
was
dismissed
from
her
charge
on
some
cause
of
disspprobation
,
though
he
did
not
say
what
.
She
then
took
a
large
house
in
Edward
Street
,
and
has
since
maintained
herself
by
letting
lodgings
.
This
Mn
Younge
.
was
,
he
knew
,
intimately
acquainted
with
Wickham
;
and
he
went
to
her
for
intelligence
of
him
,
as
soon
as
he
got
to
town
.
But
it
was
two
or
three
days
before
he
could
get
from
her
what
he
wanted
.
She
would
not
betray
her
trust
,
I
so
pose
,
without
bribery
and
corruption
,
for
she
really
did
now
where
her
friend
was
to
be
found
.
Wickham
,
indeed
,
had
gone
to
her
on
their
ﬁrst
arrival
in
London
,
and
had
she
been
able
to
receive
them
into
her
house
,
they
would
have
taken
u
their
abode
with
her
.
At
length
,
however
,
our
kind
riend
procured
the
wished-for
direction
.
They
were
in
Street
.
He
saw
Wickham
,
and
afterwards
insisted
on
seeing
Lydia
.
His
ﬁrst
object
with
her
,
he
acknowledged
,
had
been
to
persuade
her
to
quit
her
present
disgraceful
situation
,
and
return
to
her
friends
as
soon
as
they
could
be
prevailed
on
to
receive
her
,
offering
his
assistance
as
far
as
it
would
go
.
But
he
found
Lydia
absolutely
resolved
on
remaining
where
she
was
.
She
cared
for
none
of
her
friends
;
she
wanted
no
help
of
his
;
she
would
not
bar
of
leaving
Wickham
;
she
was
sure
they
should
be
married
some
time
or
other
,
and
it
did
not
much
signify
when
.
Since
such
were
her
feelings
,
it
only
remained
,
he
thought
,
to
secure
and
expedite
a
marriage
,
which
,
in
his
very
ﬁrst
conversation
with
Wickham
,
he

design
.
He
confessed
himse
f
obliged
to
leave
the
regiment
on
account
of
some
debts
of
honour
which
were
very
pressing
,
and
scrupled
not
to
lay
all
the
ill
consequences
of
Lydia’s
ﬂight
on
her
own
folly
alone
.
He
meant
to
resign
his
commission
immediately
;
and
as
to
his
ﬁrture
situation
,
he
could
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.
I41
conjecture
very
little
about
it
.
He
must
go
tomewhere
,
but
he
did
not
know
where
,
and
he
knew
he
should
have
nothing
to
live
on
.
"

Durc

he

It
once
Though
Mr
Bennet
was
not
imagined
to
be
very
rich
,
he
would
have
been
able
to
do
something
for
him
,
and
his
situation
must
have
been
beneﬁted
by
marriage
.
But
he
found
,
in
reply
to
this
question
,
that
Wickham
still
cherished
the
hope
of
more
effectually
making
his
fortune
by
marriage
in
some
other
country
.
Under
such
circumstances
,
however
,
he
was
not
likely
to
he
proof
against
the
temptation
of
immediate
relief
.
"
They
met
several
times
,
for
there
was
much
to
be
discussed
.
Wickhnm
,
of
course
,
wanted
more
than
he
could
get
,
but
at
length
was
reduced
to
be
reasonable
.
“
Everything
being
settled
between
llim
,
Mr
Darcy’s
next
st
was
to
make
our
uncle
acquainted
with
it
,
and
he
st
called
in
Jmechurch
Street
the
evening
before
I
came
home
.
But
Mr
Gardiner
could
not
be
seen
,
and
Mr
Darcy
found
,
on
further
inquiry
,
that
your
father
was
still
with
him
,
but
would
quit
town
the
next
morning
.
He
did
not
judge
your
father
to
be
a
person
whom
he
could
so
properly
consult
as
your
uncle
,
and
therefore
readily
postponed
seeing
him
till
after
the
departure
of
the
former
.
He
did
not
leave
his
name
,
and
till
the
next
day
it
was
only
known
that
a
gentleman
had
called
on
business
.
“
On
Saturday
he
came
again
.
Your
father
was
gone
,
your
uncle
at
home
,
and
,
as
I
said
before
,
they
had
a
great
deal
of
talk
together
.
“They
met
again
on
Sunday
,
and
then
I
saw
him
too
.
It
was
not
all
settled
before
Monday
:
as
soon
as
it
was
,
the
express
was
sent
off
to
Longboum
.
But
our
visitor
was
ve
ohstinnoe
.
I
fancy
,
Lizzy
,
that
obstinacy
is
the
m
defect
of
his
character
after
all
.
14
:
PRIDE
AND
PREJ'UDICE
.
He
has
been
accused
of
many
faults
at
different
times
,
but
rln
'
:
is
the
me
one
.
Nothing
was
to
be
done
that
that
he
did
not
do
himself
;
though
I
am
sure
(
and
I
do
not
speak
it
to
be
thanked
,
therefore
say
nothing
about
it
)
your
uncle
would
most
readily
have
settled
the
whole
.
“
They
battled
it
together
for
a
long
time
,
which
was
more
than
Either
the
gentleman
or
lady
concerned
in
it
deserved
.
But
at
last
your
uncle
was
forced
to
yield
,
and
instead
of
being
sllowed
to
be
of
use
to
his
niece
,
was
forced
to
put
up
with
only
having
the
probable
credit
of
it
,
which
went
sorely
against
the
grain
;
and
I
really
believe
your
letter
this
morning
gave
him
great
pleasure
,
because
it
required
an
explanation
that
would
rob
him
of
his
borrowed
feathers
,
and
give
the
praise
where
it
was
due
.
But
,
Lizzy
,
this
must
go
no
farther
than
yourself
,
or
Jane
at
.
most
.
“You
know
pretty
well
,
I
suppose
,
what
has
been
done
for
the
young
people
.
His
debts
are
to
be
paid
,
amounting
,
I
believe
,
to
considerably
more
than
a
thousand
pounds
,
another
thousand
in
addition
to
her
own
settled
upon
her
,
and
his
commission
purchased
.
The
reason
why
all
this
was
to
be
done
by
him
alone
was
such
as
I
have
given
above
.
It
was
owing
to
him
,
to
his
reserve
and
want
.
of
proper
consideration
,
that
Wickham’s
character
had
been
so
misunderstood
,
and
,
consequently
,
that
he
had
been
received
and
noticed
as
he
was
.

there
was
some
truth
in
[

,

I
doubt
whether

But
in
spite
of
all
this
ﬁne
talking
,
my
dear
Lizzy
,
you
may
rest
perfectly
assured
that
your
uncle
would
never
have
yielded
,
if
we
had
not
given
him
credit
for
(
moth
inure“
in
the
affair
.
“
When
all
this
was
resolved
on
,
he
returned
again
to
his
friends
,
who
were
still
staying
at
Pemberley
;
but
it
was
agreed
that
he
should
be
in
London
once
more
when

I

I
have
now
told

everything
.
It
il

which
you
tell

is
to
give

great
surprize
;
I
hope
at

it
will
not
afford

any
displeasure
.
Lydia
came
to
us
;
and
Wickham
had
constant
admission
to
the
house
.
1/
:
was
exactly
what
he
had
been
when
I
knew
him
in
Hertfordshire
;
but
I
would
not
tell
you
how
little
I
was
satisﬁed
with
bar
behaviour
while
she
stayed
with
us
,
if
I
had
not
rceiyed
,
by
Jane’s
letter
last
Wednesday
,
that
her
condiict
on
coming
home
was
exactly
of
a
piece
with
it
,
and
therefore
what
I
now
tell
you
can
give
you
no
fresh
pain
.
I
talked
to
her
repeatedly
in
the
most
serious
manner
,
representing
to
her
the
wickedness
of
what
she
had
done
and
all
the
unhappiness
she
had
brought
on
her
family
.
If
she
heard
me
,
it
was
by
good
luck
,
for
I
am
sure
she
did
not
listen
.
I
was
sometimes
quite
provoked
,
but
then
I
«collected
my
dear
Elizabeth
and
Jane
,
and
for
their
sakes
had
patience
with
her
.
"
Mr
Darcy
was
punctual
in
his
return
,
and
,
.as
Lydia
informed
you
,
attended
the
wedding
.
He
dined
with
us
the
next
day
,
and
was
to
leave
town
again
(
in
.
Wednesday
or
Thursday
.
Will
you
be
very
angry
with
me
,
my
dear
Lizzy
,
if
I
take
this
opportunity
of
saying
gwhat
I
was
never
hold
enough
to
say
before
)
how
much
like
him
?
His
behaviour
to
us
has
,
in
every
respect
,
been
as
pleasing
as
when
we
were
in
Derbyshire
.
His
understanding
and
opinions
all
please
me
;
he
wants
nothing
but
a
little
more
liveliness
,
and
dial
,
if
he
marry
prudently
,
his
wife
may
teach
him
.
I
thought
him
very
sly
;
—
he
hardly
ever
mentioned
your
name
.
But
slyness
seems
the
fashion
.
“
Pray
forgive
me
if
I
have
been
very
presuming
;
or
at
least
do
not
punish
me
so
far
as
to
exclude
me
from
P.
I
shall
never
be
quite
happy
till
I
have
been
all

asked
no
extraordinary
stretch
of
belief
.
It
wan
renouable
that
he
should
feel
he
had
been
wrong
;
he
had
liberality
,
and
he
had
the
mean
:
of
exerciring
it
;
and
though
she
would
not
place
herale
ae
his
principal
inducement
,
the
could
,
perhapo
,
believe
that
remaining
partiality
for
her
might
assist
hie
endeavours
in
a
cause
where
her
peace
of
mind
must
be
materially
concemed
.
It
was
painful
,
exceedingly
painful
,
to
know
that
they
were
under
obligations
to
a
person
who
could
never
receive
a
return
.
They
owed
the
restoration
of
Lydia
,
her
character
,
everything
to
him
.
Oh
!
how
heartily
did
the
grieve
over
every
ungracioue
sensation
she
had
ever
encouraged
,
every
tau
speech
she
had
ever
directed
towards
him
.
For
herdel
,
the
was
humbled
;
but
the
was
proud
of
him
.
Proud
that
in
a
cause
of
compassion
and
honour
he
had
been
able
to
get
the
better
of
himself
.
She
read
over
her
aunt’s
commendation
of
him
again
and
again
.
It
was
hardly
enough
;
but
it
pleased
her
.
She
wan
even
aenaible
of
some
plenum
,
though
mixed
with
regret
,
on
ﬁnding
how
lteadfaltl
both
the
and
her
uncle
had‘
been
penuaded
that
a
tion
and
conﬁdence
subtitled
between
Mr
Darcy
and
herself
.
She
was
roused
from
her
seat
and
her
reﬂection
:
by
come
one’e
approach
;
and
before
she
could
etrike
into
another
path
she
was
overtaken
by
Wickham
.
"

”
mid
he
,
as
he
joined

“
You

do
,
”
she
replied
with
a
smile
;
“but
it
does
not
follow
that
the
intemiption
muat
be
unwelcome.”
“I
Ihould
be
sorry
indeed
if
it
were

We
were

;
and
now
we
are

replied
in
the
afﬁrmative
.

“
Yes
,
the
did.”
“
And
what
did
she
say
?
”
“That

his
lips

had
silenced
him

She
held
out
her
hand
;
he
kissed
it
with
alTectionale
gallantry
,
though

hardly
knew
how
to
look

.
R
WICKHAM
was
so
perfectly
satisﬁed
with
this
conversation
,
that
he
never
again
distressed
himself
or
provoked
his
dear
sister
Elizabeth
by
introducing
the
subject
of
it
;
and
she
was
pleased
to
ﬁnd
that
she
had
said
enough
to
keep
him
quiet
.
The
do
of
his
and
Lydia’l
departure
soon
came
,
and
Mrs
ennet
was
forced
tosubmit
to
a
separation
which
,
as
her
husband
by
no
means
entered
into
her
scheme
of
their
all
going
to
Newcastle
,
was
likely
to
continue
at
least
a
twelvemonth
.
“
Oh
!
my
dear
Lydia
,
”
she
cried
,
“
when
shall
we
meet
again
?
'
“Oh
,
Lord
!

don’t

Not
these
two

As
often
as
I
can
.
But
you
know

have
never
much
time
for
writing
.
My

may
write

They
will
have

'
Mr
Wickham’s
adieus
were
much
more
affectionate
than
his
wife’s
.
He
smiled
,
looked
handsome
,
and
said
many
pretty
things
.
“He
is
as
ﬁne
a
fellow
,
”
said
Mr
Bennet
,
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
the
house
,
“as
ever
I
saw
.
He
simpers
,
and
smirks
,
and
makes
love
to
us
all
.
I
am
grodigiously
proud
of
him
.
I
defy
even
Sir
William
.ucas
himself
to
produce
a
more
valuable
son-in-law.”
The
loss
of
her
daughter
made
Mrs
Bennet
very
dull
for
several
da
I
.
“
I
often
think
,
’
said
she
,
“
that
there
is
nothing
so
bad
as
parting
with
one
s
friends
.
One
seems
so
forlorn
without
them.’
’
“This
is
the
consequence
,
you
seel
‘madam
,
of
marrying
a
daughter
,
'
said
Elizabeth
.
“
It
must
PRIDE
AND‘
PREJUDICE
.
I49
make
you
better
satisﬁed
that
your
other
four
are
single.”
“It
is
no
such
thing
.
L
dis
does
not
leave
me
because
she
is
married
.
but
on
y
because
her
husband's
regiment
happens
to
be
so
far
05
.
If
that
had
been
nearer
,
she
would
not
have
gone
so
soon
.
'
But
the
spiritless
condition
which
this
event
threw
her
into
was
shortly
relieved
,
and
her
mind
opened
again
to
the
agitation
of
hope
,
by
an
article
of
news
which
then
began
to
be
in
circulation
.
The
housekeeper
at
Netherﬁeld
had
received
orders
to
prepare
for
the
arrival
of
her
mnsmr
,
who
was
coming
down
in
a
day
or
two
,
to
shoot
there
for
seveml
weeks
.
Mrs
Bonnet
was
quite
in
the
ﬁdgeu
.
She
looked
at
Jane
,
and
smiled
,
and
shook
her
head
by
turns
.
“Well
,
well
,
and
so
Mr
Bingley
is
coming
down
,
sister”
(
for
Mrs
Philips
ﬁrst
brought
her
the
news
)
.
“
Well
,
so
much
the
better
.
Not
that
I
care
about
it
,
though
.
He
is
nothing
to
us
,
you
know
,
and
1
am
sure
I
never
want
to
see
him
again
.
But
,
however
,
he
is
very
welcome
to
come
to
Netherﬁeld
,
if
he
likes
it
.
And
who
knows
what
may
happen
?
But
that
is
nothing
to
us
.
You
know
,
sister
,
we
agreed
long
ago
never
to
mention
a
word
about
it
.
And
so
,
is
it
quite
cemin
he
is
coming
2
”
“You
may
depend
on
it
,
'
replied
the
other
,
“for
Mrs
Nichols
was
in
Meryton
last
night
;
I
saw
her
passing
by
,
and
went
out
myself
on
purpose
to
know
the
truth
of
it
;
and
she
told
me
that
it
was
certainly
true
.
He
comes
down
on
Thursday
at
the
latest1
very
likely
on
Wednesday
.
She
was
going
to
the
butcher’s
,
she
told
me
,
on
purpose
to
order
in
some
meat
on
Wednesday
,
and
she
has
got
three
couple
of
ducks
just
ﬁt
to
be
killed.”
Miss
Bennet
had
not
been
able
to
hear
of
his
coming
without
changing
colour
.
It
was
many
months
since
150
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.
she
had
mentioned
his
name
to
Elizabeth
;
but
now
,
II
soon
as
they
were
alone
together
,
she
said
—
—
“I
saw
you
look
at
me
to-dny
,
Lin
,
when
m
aunt
told
us
of
the
present
report
;
an
I
know
i
op
ared
distressed
;
but
don’t
imagine
it
was
from
any
ul
y
canoe
.
I
was
only
confused
for
the
moment
,
because
Ifelt
that
I
should
be
looked
at
.
I
do
assure
you
that
the
news
does
not
aﬂ‘ect
me
either
with
pleasure
or
pain
.
I
am
glad
of
one
thing
—
that
he
comes
alone
;
because
we
shall
see
the
less
of
him
.
Not
that
I
am
afraid
of
myulf
,
but
I
dread
other
peo
le’s
remarks.”
liznbeth
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
.
Had
she
not
seen
him
in
Derbyshire
,
she
might
have
supposed
him
capable
of
coming
there
with
no
other
view
than
what
was
acknowledged
;
but
she
still
thought
him
partial
to
June
,
and
she
wavered
as
to
the
greater
probability
of
his
coming
there
with
his
friend’s
permission
,
or
being
bold
enough
to
come
without
it
.
“Yet
it
it
hard
,
”
she
sometimes
thought
,
“that
this
poor
man
can
not
come
to
a
house
which
he
has
le
lly
hired
without
raising
all
this
speculation
!
I
said
esve
him
to
himself.”
In
spite
of
what
her
sister
declared
,
and
really
believed
to
be
her
feelings
,
in
the
expectation
of
his
arrival
,
Elizabeth
could
easily
perceive
that
her
spirits
were
affected
by
it
.
They
were
more
disturbed
,
more
nn
ual
,
than
she
had
often
seen
them
.
he
subject
which
had
been
so
warmly
canvassed
between
their
parents
about
a
twelvemonth
ago
was
now
brought
forward
again
.
“
As
soon
as
ever
Mr
Bingley
comes
,
my
dear
,
”
said
Mrs
Bonnet
,
“
you
will
wait
on
him
,
of
course
.
'
“No
,
no
.
You
forced
me
into
visiting
him
last
year
,
and
promised
,
if
I
went
to
see
him
,
he
should
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE15
!
marry
one
of
my
daughters
.
But
it
ended
in
nothing
,
and
I
will
not
be
sent
on
a
fool’s
errand
again.”
His
wife
represented
to
him
how
absolutely
necessary
such
an
attention
would
be
from
all
the
neighbouring
gentlemen
,
on
his
returning
to
Netherﬁeld
.
"
’Tis

etiquette
I
despise
,
”
said
he
.
“
If
he
wants
our
society
,
let
him
seck
it
.
He
knows
where
we
live
.
I
will
not
spend
my
hours
in
mnning
after
my
neighbours
every
time
they
go
away
and
come
back
again.”
“Well
,
all
I
know
is
,
that
it
will
be
abominany
rude
if
you
do
not
wait
on
him
.
But
,
however
,
that
shsn’t
prevent
my
asking
him
to
dine
here
,
I
am
determined
.
We
must
have
Mrs
Long
and
the
Gouldings
soon
.
That
will
make
thirteen
with
ourselves
,
so
there
will
be
just
room
at
table
for
him.”
Consoled
by
this
resolution
,
she
was
the
better
able
to
hear
her
husband’s
incivilityt
though
it
was
very
mortifying
to
know
that
her
neighbours
might
all
see
Mr
Brngley
,
in
con
uence
of
it
,
before
Me

did
.
As
the
day
of
his
arrival
rew
near
,
“
I
begin
to
be
sorry
that
he
comes
at
all
,
”
said
Jane
to
her
sister
.
“It
would
be
nothing
;
I
could
see
him
with
perfect
indifference
;
but
I
can
hardly
beer
to
hear
it
thus
perpetually
talked
of
.
My
mother
means
well
;
but
she
does
not
know
—
no
one
can
know
—
how
much
I
suiier
from
what
she
says
.
Happy
shall
I
be
when
his
stay
at
Netherﬁeld
is
over
!
”
“
I
wish
I
could
say
anything
to
comfort
you
,
”
replied
Elizabeth
;
“but
it
is
wholly
out
of
my
power
.
You
must
feel
it
;
and
the
usual
satisfaction
of
preaching
patience
to
a
sufferer
is
denied
me
,
because
you
have
always
so
much
.
'
Mr
Bingley
arrived
.
Mrs
Bennet
,
through
the
assistance
of
servants
,
contrived
to
have
the
earliest
tidings
of
it
,
that
the
period
of
anxiety
and
fretfulness
on
her
side
might
be
as
long
as
it
could
.
She
counted

AND

.
the
days
that
must
intervene
before
their
invitation
could
be
sent
—
hopeless
of
seeing
him
before
.
But
,
on
the
third
morning
after
his
arrival
in
Hertfordshire
,
she
saw
him
from
her
dressing-room
window
enter
the
paddock
and
ride
towards
the
house
.
Her
daughters
were
eagerly
called
to
partake
of
her
jo
.
Jane
resolutely
kept
her
place
at
the
table
;
but
Elianbeth
,
to
satisfy
her
mother
,
went
to
the
window
,
—
she
looked
—
she
saw
Mr
Darcy
with
him
,
and
sat
down
again
by
her
sister
.
“There
is
a
gentleman
with
him
,
mamma
,
”
said
Kitty
;
“who
can
it
be
2
”
“
Some
acquaintance
or
other
,
my
dear
,
I
suppose
;
I
am
sure
I
do
not
know
.
'
“
La
!
”
replied
Kitty
,
"
it
looks
just
like
that
man
that
used
to
he
with
him
before
,
—
—
Mr
whnt'l

—

“
Good
gracious
!
Mr
Darcy
!
—
:
md
so
it
does
,
I
vow
.
Well
,
any
friend
of
Mr
Bingley’s
will
always
be
welcome
here
,
to
be
sure
;
but
else
I
must
say
that
.
I
hate
the
very
sight
of
him.”
Jane
looked
at
Elizabeth
with
surprizo
and
concern
.
She
knew
but
little
of
their
meeting
in
Derbyshire
,
and
therefore
felt
for
the
awkwardness
which
must
attend
her
sister
,
in
seeing
him
almost
for
the
ﬁrst
time
after
receiving
his
explanatory
letter
.
Both
sisters
were
uncomfortable
enough
.
Each
felt
for
the
other
,
and
of
course
for
themselves
;
and
their
mother
talked
on
,
of
her
dislike
of
Mr
Darcy
,
and
her
resolution
to
be
civil
to
him
only
as
Mr
Bingle
’s
friend
,
without
being
heard
by
eitherof
them
.
lint
Elizabeth
had
sources
of
uneasiness
which
could
not
be
suspected
by
Jane
,
to
whom
she
had
never
yet
had
courage
to
show
Mrs
Gardiner’s
letter
,
or
to
relate
her
own
change
of
sentiment
towards
him
.
To
Jane
,
he
could
be
only
a
man
whose
proposals
she
had
refused
,
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.
[
53
and
whose
merit
she
had
undervalued
;
but
to
her
own
more
extensive
information
,
he
was
the
person
to
whom
the
whole
family
were
indebted
for
the
ﬁrst
of
beneﬁts
,
and
whom
she
regarded
heraelf
with
an
interest
,
if
not
uite
so
tender
,
at
least
as
reasonable
and
just
as
what
ane
felt
for
Bingley
.
Her
astonishment
at
his
coming
—
at
his
coming
to
Netherﬁeld
,
to
Longbourn
,
and
voluntarily
seeking
her
again
,
was
almost
equal
to
what
she
had
known
on
ﬁrst
witnessing
his
altered
behaviour
in
Derbyshire
.
The
colour
which
had
been
driven
from
her
face
,
returned
for
half
a
minute
with
an
additional
low
,
and
a
smile
of
delight
added
lustre
to
her
e
es
,
as
s
e
thought
for
that
space
of
time
,
that
his
ection
and
wishes
must
still
be
unshaken
.
But
she
would
not
be
secure
.
“
Let
me
ﬁrst
see
how
he
behaves
,
'
said
she
;
“
it
will
then
be
earl
enough
for
expectation
.
'
She
sat
intentiy
at
work
striving
to
be
composed
,
and
without
daring
to
lift
up
her
eyes
,
till
anxious
curiosity
carried
them
to
the
face
of
her
sister
,
as
the
servant
was
approaching
the
door
.
Jane
looked
a
little
paler
than
usual
,
but
more
udate
than
Eliubeth
had
expected
.
0n
the
gentlcmcn’s
appearing
,
her
colour
increased
;
yet
she
received
them
with
tolerable
ease
,
and
with
a
propriety
of
behaviour
equally
free
from
any
symptom
of
resentment
,
or
any
unnecessary
complaisance
.
Elizabeth
said
as
little
to
either
as
civility
would
allow
,
and
sat
down
again
to
her
work
,
with
an
ugerness
which
it
did
not
often
command
.
She
had
ventured
only
one
glance
at
Darcy
.
He
looked
serious
as
usual
,
and
,
she
thought
,
more
as
he
had
been
used
to
look
in
Hertfordshire
,
than
as
she
had
seen
him
at
Pemberley
.
But
,
perhaps
,
he
could
not
in
her
mother's
presence
be
what
he
was
before
her
uncle
and
aunt
.
It
was
a
painful
,
but
not
an
improbable
,
conjecture
.

by

PpDarcy
,
after
inquiring
of
her
how
Mr
and
Mn
Gardiner
did
—
a
question
which
she
could
not
answer
without
confusion
—
said
scarcely
anything
.
He
was
not
seated
by
her
;
perhaps
that
was
the
reason
of
his
silence
;
but
.
it
had
not
be¢n
so
in
Derbyshire
.
There
he
had
talked
to
her
friends
.
when
he
could
not
so
herself
.
But
now
several
minutes
elapsed
,
without
bringing
the
sound
of
his
voice
;
and
when
occasionally
,
unable
to
resist
the
impulse
of
curiosity
,
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
face
,
she
ac
often
found
him
looking
at
Jane
as
at
herself
,
and
fre
uently
on
no
ohject
but
the
ground
.
More
thoughtfidness
,
and
less
anxiety
to
please
than
when
they
last
met
,
were
plainly
expressed
.
She
was
disappointed
,
and
angry
with
herself
for
being
so
.
“Could
I
expect
it
to
be
otherwise
!
”
said
the

“

"
She
was

;

”
Bingley
replied
that
he
did
,
and
made
his
congratulations
.
Elizabeth
dared
not
lift
up
her
eyes
.
How
Mr
Darcy
looked
,
therefore
,
she
could
not
tell
.
“
It
is
a
delightful
thing
,
so
be
sure
,
to
have
a
daughter
well
married
.
'
continued
her
mother
;
“but
,
at
the
same
time
,
Mr
Bingley
,
it
is
very
hard
to
have
her
taken

do
not

how
long
.
His

is
there
;
for
I
suppose
you
have
heard
of
his
leaving
the
shire
,
and
of
his
being
gone
into
the
regulars
.
Thank
Heaven
!
he

,

'
Elizabeth
,
who
knew
this
to
be
levelled
at
Mr
Darcy
,
was
in
such
misery
of
shame
that
she
could
hardly
keep
her
seat
.
It
drew
from
her
,
however
,
the
exertion
of
speaking
,
which
nothing
else
had
so
effectually
done
before
;
and
she
asked
Bingley
whether
he
meant
to
make
any
stay
in
the
country
at
present
.
A
few
weeks
,
he
believed
.
“

,

S
soon
as
they
were
gone
Elizabeth
walked
out
to
recover
her
spirim
—
or
,
in
other
words
,
to
dwell
without
interruption
on
those
subjects
that
must
deaden
them
more
.
Mr
Darcy’s
behaviour
astonished
and
vexed
her
.
“Why
,
if
he
came
only
to
be
silent
,
grave
,
and
indiﬁcrcnt

said
she
,
“

Her
resolution
was
for
a
short
time
involuntarily
kept
by
the
ap
roach
of
her
sister
,
who
joined
her
with
a
cheerful
ook
,
which
showed
her
better
satisﬁed
with

than

hen
they
r
‘Iil’t‘d
to
the
dining-room
,
Elizabeth
eagerly
watch
to
see
whether
Bingley
would
take
the
place
which
,
in
all
their
former
parties
,
had
belonged
to
him
,
by
her
sitter
.
Her
prudent
mother
,
occupied
by
the
same
ideas
,
forbore
to
invite
him
to
sit
by
herself
.
On
entering
the
room
,
he
seemed
to
hesitate
;
hut
Jane
happened
to
look
round
,
and
happened
to
smile
;
it
um
decided
—
he
placed
himself
by
her
.
Elizabeth
,
with
a
triumphant
sensation
,
looked
to«
wards
his
friend
.
He
bore
it
with
noble
indifference
,
and
she
would
have
imagined
that
Bingley
had
received
his
sanction
to
be
happ
,
had
she
not
seen
his
eye
:
likewise
turned
towards
Nii
—
Darcy
,
with
an
expression
of
half-laughing
alarm
.
His
behaviour
to
her
sister
was
such
,
during
dinnertime
,
as
showed
an
admiration
of
her
which
,
though
more
guarded
than
formerly
,
persuaded
Elizabeth
,
that
if
left
wholly
to
himself
,
Jane

would
be
speedily
secured
.
Though
the
dared
not
depend
upon
the
consequence
,
she
yet
received
pleasure
from
observing
his
behaviour
.
It
gave
her
all
the
animation
that
her
Ipirits
could
bout
5
for
she
was
in
no
cheerful
humour
.
Mr
Darcy
was
almott
as
far
from
her
as
the
table
could
divide
them
.
He
was
on
one
side
of
her
mother
.
She
knew
how
little
such
a
situation
would
give
pleasure
to
either
,
or
make
either
appear
to
advantage
.
She
was
not
near
enough
to
hear
any
of
their
discourse
;
but
she
could
see
how
seldom
they
spoke
to
each
other
,
and
how
formal
and
cold
was
their
manner
whenever
they
did
.
Her
mother’s
ungraciouaneu
made
the
sense
of
what
they
owed
him
more
painful
to
Elizabeth’s
mind
;
and
she
would
,
at
times
,
have
given
anything
to
be
privileged
to
tell
him
that
his
hindnest
was
neither
unknown
nor
unfelt
by
the
whole
of
the
family
.
She
was
in
hopes
that
the
evening
would
afford
some
opportunity
of
bringing
them
together
;
that
the
whole
of
the
virit
would
not
pass
away
without
enabling
them
to
enter
into
somethin
more
of
ccnvemtion
,
than
the
mere
ceremonious
sa
utation
attending
his
entrance
.
Anxious
and
uneasy
,
the
period
which
passed
in
the
drawing-room
,
before
the
gentlemen
came
,
was
wearisome
and
dull
to
a
degree
that
made
her
almost
uncivil
.
She
looked
{
onward
to
their
entrance
as
the
point
on
:
llehriechdall
her
chance
of
pleasure
for
the
evening
must

“
If
he
does
not
come
to
me

,
”
said
she
,
“
I
shall
give
him
up
for
ever
.
'
The
gentlemen
came
;
and
she
thought
he
looked
as
if
he
would
have
amwered
her
hopes
;
but
,
alas
!
the
ladies
had
crowded
round
the
table
,
where
Miss
Bennet
was
taking
tea
,
and
Elizabeth
pouring
out
the
coﬂee
,
in
so
close
a
confederacy
,
that
there
was
not
a
single
vacancy
near
her
which
would
admit
of
a
chair
.
And

name
no
rsewnrcs
.
on
the
gentlemen’s
approaching
,
one
of
the
girls
moved
closer
to
her
than
ever
,
and
said
,
in
a
whisper
—
“
The
men
shsn’t
come
and
part
us
,
I
am
determined
.
We
want
none
of
them
;

"
Dare
had
walked
away
to
another
part
of
the
room
.
She
fol
owed
him
with
her
eyes
,
envted
every
one
to
whom
he
spoke
,
had
scarcely
patience
enough
to
hel
anybody
to
wife
,
and
then
was
enraged
against
herse
f
for
being
so
silly
!
“
A
man
who
has
once
been
refused
!
How
could
I
ever
be
foolish
enough
to
expect
a
renewal
of
his
love
?
In
there
one
among
the
sex
who
would
not
protest
against
such
a
weakness
as
a
second
proposal
to
the
mime
woman
?
There
is
no
indignity
so
abhorrent
to
their
feelings
!
”
She
was
a
little
revived
,
however
,
by
his
bringing
back
his
coffee-cup
himself
;
and
she
seized
the
opportunit
of
saying
,
“
Is
your
mister

Pemberlcy

”
“

,
she
will
remain
there
till
Christmas

“

"
“
Mrs
Annealey
is
with
her
.
The
others
have
been
gone
on
to
Scarborough
these
three
weeks.”
She
could
think
of
nothing
more
to
say
;
but
if
he
wished
to
converse
with
her
,
he
might
have
better
success
.
He
stood
by
her
,
however
,
for
some
minutes
,
in
silence
;
and
,
at
last
,
on
the
young
ladies
whispering
to
Elizabeth
again
,
he
walked
away
.
When
the
tea-things
were
removed
,
and
the
cardtables
placed
,
the
ladies
all
rose
,
and
Elizabeth
was
then
hoping
to
be
soon
joined
by
him
,
when
all
her
views
were
overthrown
by
seeing
him
fall
a
victim
to
her
mother’s
mpacity
[
or
whim-players
,
and
in
a
few
moments
after
seated
with
the
rest
of
the
party
.
She
now
lost
every
;
expectation
of
pleasure
.
They
were
conﬁned
for
the
evening
at
different
tables
,
and
she
had
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.

:
nothing
to
huge
,
but
that
his
eyes
were
so
often
turned
towards
her
side
of
the
room
,
as
to
make
him
play
as
unsuccessfully
as
herself
.
Mrs
Bennet
had
designed
to
keep
the
two
Netheriield
gentlemen
to
supper
;
but
their
carriage
was
unluckin
ordered
before
any
of
the
others
,
and
she
had
no
opportunity
of
detaining
them
.
"
Well
,
girls
,
”
said
she
,
as
soon
as
they
were
left
to
themselves
,
“what
say
you
to
the
day
?
I
think
everything
has
passed
all
unoommonl
well
,
I
assure
you
.
The
dinner
was
as
well
dressed
as
any
I
ever
saw
.
The
venison
was
roasted
to
a
turn
—
and
everybody
said
,
they
never
saw
so
fat
at
haunch
.
The
soup
was
ﬁfty
times
better
than
what
we
had
at
the
Lucases’
last
week
;
and
even
Mr
Darcy
acknowledged
,
that
the
partridges
were
rernarkabl
well
done
;
and
I
suppose
he
has
two
or
three
rench
cooks
at
least
.
And
,
my
dear
Jane
,
I
never
saw
you
look
in
greater
beauty
.
Mrs
Long
said
so
too
,
for
I
asked
her
whether
you
did
not
.
And
what
do
you
think
she
said
besides
?
‘Ah
!
Mrs
Bennet
,
we
shall
have
her
It
Netherﬁeld
at
last.’
She
did
indeed
.
I
do
think
Mrs
Lung
is
as
good
a
creature
as
ever
lived
—
and
her
nieces
are
very
pretty
behaved
girls
,
and
not
at
all
handsome
:
I
like
them
prodigiously.”
Mrs
Bennet
,
in
shunt
,
was
in
very
great
spirits
.
She
had
seen
enough
of
Bin
ley’s
behaviour
to
Jane
,
to
be
convinced
that
she
woul
get
him
at
last
;
and
her
expeemtions
of
advantage
to
her
family
,
when
in
3
ha
humour
,
were
so
far
beyond
reason
,
that
she
was
quite
disappoian
at
not
seeing
him
there
again
the
next
day
to
make
his
proposals
.
“
It
has
been
a
very
agreeable
day
,
'
said
Miss
Bennet
to
Elizabeth
.
“The
party
seemed
so
well
selected
,
so
suitable
one
with
the
other
.
I
hope
we
may
often
meet
again.”

Elizabeth
smiled
.
“
Lizzy
,
you
must
not
do
so
.
You
must
not
ouspect
me
.
It
mortiﬁes
me
.
I
assure
you
that
I
hsve
now
learnt
to
enjoy
his
conversation
as
an
agreeable
and
sensible
young
man
,
without
having
a
wish
beyond
it
.
I
am
perfectly
satisﬁed
from
what
his
manners
now
are
,
that
he
never
had
any
design
of
engaging
my
aﬁ‘ec»
tion
.
It
is
only
that
he
is
blessed
with
greater
sweetness
of
address
,
and
a
stronger
desire
of
generally
pleating
,
than
any
other
man
.
'
"
You
are
very
cmel
,
'
said
her
sister
;
“you
will
not
let
me
smile
,
and
are
provoking
me
to
it
every
moment.”
“
How
hard
it
is
in
some
cases
to
he
believed
!
”*
“
And
how
impossible
in
others
!
”
“
But
why
should
you
wish
to
persuade
me
that
I
feel
more
than
I
acknowledge
?

“That

FEW
days
after
this
visit
,
Mr
Binglcy
called
again
,
and
alone
.
His
friend
had
left
him
that
morning
for
London
,
but
was
to
return
home
in
ten
days’
time
.
He
sat
with
them
above
an
hour
,
and
was
in
remarkably
good
spirits

invited
him
to
dine
with
them
;
but
,
with
many
expressions
of
concern
,
he
confessed
himself
engaged
elsewhere
.
"
Next

said
she
,
“I

'
“
Can

'
“
Yes
,
he
had
no
engagement
at
all
for
to-morrow
;
"
and
her
invitation
was
accepted
with
alacrity
.
He
came
,
and
in
such
very
good
time
,
that
the
ladies
were
none
of
them
dressed
.
In
ran
Mrs
Bonnet
to
her
daughters’
room
,
in
her
dressing
gown
,
and
with
her
hair
half
ﬁnished
,
crying
out
,
“
My
dear
Jane
,

and
hurry
down
.

“We
will
be
down
as
soon
as
we
can
,
”
said
Jane
;
“
but
I
dare
say
Kitty
is
forwarder
than
either
of
us
,
for
she
went
upstairs
half
an
hour
ago.”
“Oh
!

has
she
to

with

?
Come

”
But
when
her
mother
was
gone
,
Jane
would
not
he
prevailed
on
to
go
down
without
one
of
her
sisters
.
The
ume
anxiety
to
get
[
them
by
themselves
,
was
visible
again
in
the
evening
.
A
ter
tea
,
Mr
Bonnet
retired
to
the
library
,
as
was
his
custom
,
and
Mary
went
upstairs
to
her
instrument
.
Two
obstacles
of
the
ﬁve
being
thus
removed
,
Mrs
Bennet
sat
looking
and
winking
at
Elizabeth
and
Catherine
for
a
considerable
time
,
without
making
any
impression
on
them
.
Elizabeth
would
not
observe
her
;
and
when
at
last
Kitty

AND

did
,
she
ve
innocently
said
,
“What
is
the
matter
,
mammal
at
do
you
keep
winking
at
me
for
?
What
am
I
to
do
?
”
“
Nothing
,
child
,
nothing
.
I
did
not
wink
at
you
.
'
She
then
sat
still
live
mmutes
longer
;
but
,
unable
to
waste
such
a
recious
occasion
,
she
suddenly
got
up
,
and
saying
to
léitty
,
“
Come
here
,
my
love
,
I
want
to
speak
to
you
,
'
took
her
out
of
the
room
.
Jane
instantly
gave
a
look
at
Elizabeth
.
which
spoke
her
distress
at
such
remeditstion
,
and
her
entreaty
that
:5
:
would
not
give
in
to
it
.
In
a
few
minutes
,
Mrs
Bonnet
half
opened
the
door
,
and
called
out
,
“
Lizzy
,
my
dear
,
I
want
to
speak
with
you.”
Elizabeth
was
forced
to
go
.
“
We
may
as
well
leave
them
by
themselves
,
you
know
,
'
said
her
mother
as
soon
as
she
was
in
the
hall
.
“
Kitty
and
I
are
going
upstairs
to
sit
in
my
dressing-room.”
Elizabeth
made
no
attempt
to
reason
with
her
mother
,
but
remained
quietly
in
the
hall
till
she
and
Kitty
were
out
of
sight
,
then
returned
into
the
drawingroom
.
Mrs
Bennet’u
schemes
for
this
day
were
inelfectusl
.
Bingley
was
everything
that
was
charming
,
except
the
professed
lover
of
her
daughter
.
His
ease
and
cheerfulness
rendered
him
a
most
agreeable
addition
to
their
evening
party
;
and
he
bore
with
the
ill-'udged
oﬂiciousness
of
the
mother
,
and
heard
all
her
silly
remarks
,
with
a
forbearance
and
command
of
countenance
particularly
grateful
to
the
daughter
.
He
scarcely
needed
an
invitation
to
sta
supper
;
and
before
he
went
away
,
an
engagement
vms
armed
,
chieﬂy
through
his
own
and
Mrs
Bennet’s
means
,
for
his
coming
next
morning
to
shoot
with
her
husband
.
After
this
day
,
Jane
said
no
more
of
her
indifference
.
Not
a
word
passed
between
the
sisters
concerning
PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
.

Bing

;
but
Elizabeth
went
to
bed
in
the
he
py
belief
that
al
must
speedily
be
concluded
,
unless
r
Darcy
returned
within
the
stated
time
.
Seriously
,
however
,
she
felt
tolerably
persuaded
that
all
this
must
have
taken
place
with
that
gentleman’s
concurrence
.
Bingle
was
punctual
to
his
appointment
;
and
he
and
Mr
bennet
spent
the
morning
together
,
as
had
been
agreed
on
.
The
latter
was
much
more
agreeable
than
his
companion
expected
.
There
was
nothing
of
presumption
or
folly
in
Bingley
,
that
could
provoke
his
ridicule
,
or
disgust
him
into
silence
;
and
he
was
more
communicative
and
less
eccentric
than
the
other
had
ever
seen
him
.
Dingley
of
course
returned
with
him
to
dinner
;
and
in
the
evening
Mrs
Bennet’s
invention
was
again
at
work
to
get
everybody
away
from
him
and
her
daughter
.
Elizabeth
,
who
had
a
letter
to
write
,
went
into
the
breakfast-room
for
that
purpose
soon
after
ten
;
for
as
the
others
were
all
going
to
sit
down
to
cards
,
she
could
not
be
wanted
to
counteract
her
mother’s
schemes
.
But
on
returning
to
the
drawing-room
when
her
letter
was
ﬁnished
,
she
saw
,
to
her
inﬁnite
surprise
,
there
was
reason
to
fear
that
her
mother
had
been
too
ingenious
for
her
.
On
opening
the
door
,
she
perceived
her
sister
and
Bingley
standing
together
over
the
hearth
,
as
if
engaged
in

could

express

Every
sentence
of
kindness
was
a
fresh
source
of
happiness
to
Jane
.
But
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
stay
with

,
or
say
half
that
remained
to
be

,
for

hastened
away
to
her

who
had
purposely
broken
up
the
card
party
,
and
was
sitting
upstairs
with
Kitty
.
Elizabeth
,
who
was
left
by
herself
,
now
smiled
at
the
rapidity
and
ease
with
which
an
affair
was
ﬁnally
settled
,
that
had

them
so
many

Elizabeth
honestly

in
the

They
shook

with
great

;

her

came
down
,
she
had
to
listen
to
all

had

of

;
and
in

Elizabeth
renll
believed
all
his
expectations
of
felicity
to
be
rationally
founded
,
because
they
had
for
basis
the
excellent
understanding
and
super-excellent
dis
tion
of
Jane
,
and
a
general
similarity
of
feeling
an
taste
between
her
and
himself
.
It
was
an
evening
of
no
common
delight
to
them
all
.
The
satisfaction
of
Miss
Bennet’s
mind
gave
such
a
glow
of
sweet
animation
to
her
face
,
as
made
her
look
handsomer
than
ever
.
Kitty
simpered
and
smiled
,
and
hoped
her
turn
was
coming
soon
.
Mrs
Bennet
could
not
give
her
consent
or
speak
her
approbau'on
in
terms
warm
enough
to
satisfy
her
feelings
,
though
she
talked
to
Bingley
of
nothing
else
for
half
an
hour
;
and
when
Mr
Bennet
joined
them
at
supper
,
his
voice
and
manner
plainly
showed
how
really
happ
he
was

Not
a

however

passed

his
lips
in

to
it

till
their
visitor
took
his
lave
for

as
soon
as
he
was
gone

he
turned
to
his

said

him
for
his

“

her

soon
began
to

for
ob‘ecta

she
might

Kitty

Bingley
,
from
this

was
of

a
daily
visitor
atZLongboum
,
—
coming
frequently
before

and
always
remaining
till

—
unless
when
some
barbarous
neighbour
,
who
could
not

dawned
,
had
given
him
an
invitation
to
dinner
,
which
he
thought
himself
obliged
to
accept

Elizabeth
had
now
but
little
time
for

with
her
sister
;
for
while
he
was
present

Jane
had
no

but
she
found
herself
considerably
useful
to
both
of
them
,
in
those
hours
of
separation
that

In

morning
,
about
a
week
after
Bingley’s
engagement
with
Jane
had
been
formed
,
as
he
and
the
females
of
the
family
were
sitting
together
in
the
dining-room

their
attention
wan
suddenly
drawn
to
the
window
,
by
the
sound
of
a
carriage
;
and
they
perceived
a
chaise-and-four
driving
u
the
lawn
.
It
was
too
early
in
the
morning
for
lelmﬂ
,
and
besides
,
the
equipage
did
not
answer
to
that
of
any
of
their
neighbours

The
horses
were
post
;
and
neither
the
carriage
nor
the
livery
of
the
servant
who
preceded
it
,
were
familiar
to
them
.
As
it
was
certain

that
somebody
was

Bingley

prevailed

Miss

to

intrusion

away

She
entered
the
room
with
an
air
more
than
usually
ungracious
,
made
no
other
reply
to
Elizabeth’s
salutation
than
a
slight
inelinstion
of
the
head
,
and
sat
down
without

Elizabeth
had
mentioned
her

reached
me
two

I
was

that

my

Mr

I
would
not
injure
him
so
much
as
to
suppose

,
I
instantly
resolved
on
setting
off
for
this
pace
,
that
I
might
make
my
sentiments
known
to
you.”
“If
you
believed
it
impossible
to
be
true
,

said
Elizabeth
,
colouring
with
astonishment
and
disdain
,
“
I
wonder

took
the

At

“Your

Eliubeth
coolly
,
“
will
be

a

such

“If

Miss

Lady

hesitated
for
a
moment
,
and
then
replied
—
“The

now
,
at
the
moment
when
the
wishes
of
both
sisters
would
be
accomplished
in
their
marriage
,
to
be
prevented
by
a
youn
woman
of
inferior
birth
,
of
no
impomnce
in
the
word
,
and
wholly
unallied
to
the

Do
you
pay
no

to
the
wishes
of

friends
—
to
his
tacit
engagement
with

?
Are
you
lost

every
feeling

Have
you
not

from

hours
he

Yes

I
had
heard

there

I

certainly
not

it
by
knowing
that
his

wished
him
to

Miss

.
You
both
did
as
much
as
you
cool
,
in
planning
the
marriage
;
its
completion
depended
on

If
Mr

is
neither

why
is

,
she
concluded
,

reached
Lady
Catherine
)
,
had
only
set
rim

down
as
almost
certain
and
immediate
,
which
ab
:
had
looked
forward
to
as
possible
,
at
some
future
time
.
In
revolving
Lady
Catherine’s
expressions
,
however
,
she
could
not
help
feeling
some
uneasiness
as
to
the
ssible
consequence
of
her
persisting
in
this
intererence
.
From
what
she
had
said
of
her
resolution
to
prevent
their
marriage
,
it
occurred
to
Elizabeth
that
she
must
meditate
an
application
(
0
her
nephew
;
and
how
I
)
:
might
take
a
similar
representation
of
the
evils
attached
to
a
connection
with
her
,
she
dared
not
ronounce
.
She
knew
not
the
exact
degree
of
his
axiotion
for
his
aunt
,
or
his
dependence
on
her
judgment
,
but
it
was
natural
to
suppose
that
he
thought
much
higher
of
her
ladyahip
than
:
be
could
do
;
and
it
was
certain
that
,
in
enumerating
the
miseries
of
a
marriage
with
one
whose
immediate
connections
were
so
unequal
to
his
own
,
his
aunt
would
address
him
on
his
weakest
side
.
With
his
notions
of
dignity
,
he
would
probably
feel
that
the
arguments
which
to
Elizabeth
had
appeared
weak
and
ridiculous
,
contained
much
good
sense
and
solid
reasoning
.
If
he
had
been
wavering
before
as
to
what
he
should
do
,
which
had
often
seemed
likely
,
the
adﬁce

entreaty
of
so
near
a
relation
might
settle
every
doubt
,
and
determine
him
at
once
to
be
as
happy
as
dignity
unblemished
could
make
him
.
In
that
cue
,
he
would
return
no
more
.
Lady
Catherine
might
see
him
in
her
way
through
town
,
and
his
engagement
to
Bingley
of
coming
again
to
Netherlield
must
give
way
.
“
If
,
therefore
,
an
excuse
for
not
keeping
his
promise
should
come
to
his
friend
within
a
few
days
,

she
added
,
"

The
surprize
of
the
rest
of
the
family
,
on
hearing
who
their
visitor
had
been
,
was
very
great
;
but
they
obligingiy
satisﬁed
it
with
the
me
kind
of
supposition
which
:1
nppeased
Mrs
Bennet’s
curiosity
;
and
Elizabeth
was
spared
from
much
teasing
on
the
subject
.
The
next
morning
,
as
she
was
going
downstairs
,
she
was
met
by
her
fnther
,
who
came
out
of
his
library
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
.
“
Lizzy
,
'
said
he
,
“I
was
going
to
look
for
you
;
come
into
my
room.”
She
followed
him
thither
;
and
her
curiosity
to
know
what
he
had
to
tell
her
was
heightened
by
the
supposi~u‘on
of
its
being
in
some
manner
connected
with
the
letter
he
held
.
It
suddenly
muck
her
that
it
might
be
from
Lady
Catherine
;
and
she
anticipated
with
dismay
all
the
consequent
ex
lanntions
.
She
followed
her
ether
to
the
ﬁreplace
,
and
they
both
sat
down
.
He
then
said
—
“
I
have
received
a
letter
this
morning
that
has
astonished
me
exceedingly
.
As
it
principally
concerns
yourself
,
on
ought
to
know
its
contents
.
I
did
not

matrimony
.
Let
me
congratulate
you
on
a
very
important
conquest.”
The
colour
now
rushed
into
Elizabeth’s
cheeks
in
the
instantaneous
conviction
of
its
being
a
letter
from
the
nephew
,
instead
of
the
aunt
;
and
she
was
undetermined
whether
most
to
be
pleased
that
he
explained
himself
at
all
,
or
oﬂ'ended
that
his
letter
was
not
rather
addressed
to
herself
;
when
her
father
continued
—
‘
“

“

what
can

to
say
?
”
“Something
very
much
to
the
purpose

He
begins
with
congratulations
on
the
approaching
nuptials
of

daughter

it
seems
he
has
been
told
,

of

good-natured

Lucases

I
shall
not
sport
with
your
impatience
by
reading
what
he
says
on
that
point

What
relates
to
yourself
is
as

:
‘Having
thus
offered
you
the
sincere
congratulations
of
Mrs
Collins
and
myself
on
this
happy
event

let
me
now
add
a
short
hint
on
the
subjecto
another
;
of
which
we
have
been
advertised
by
the
same
authority
.
Your
daughter
Elizabeth
,
it
is
presumed
,
will
not
long
bear
the
name
of
Bonnet
,
after
her
elder
sister
has
resigned
it
,
and
the
chosen
partner
of
her
fate
may
be
reasonably
looked
up
to
as
one
of
the
most
illustrious
personages
in
this
land.’
“
Can
you

guess
,
Lizzy
,
who
is
meant
by
this
?

‘
This
young
gentleman
is
blessed
,
in

way

with
everything
the
heart
of
mortal
can
most
desire
,
—
splendid
property
,
noble
kindred
,
and
extensive
patronage
.
Yet
,
In
spite
of
all
these
temptations
,
let
me
warn
my
cousin
Elizabeth
,
and
yourself
,
of
what
evils
you
may
incur
by
a

closure

Mr

who
never

‘
After
mentioning
the
likelihood
of
this
marriage
to
her
IadyshiP
last
night
,
she
immediately
,
with
her
usual
condescenslon
,
expressed
what
she
felt
on
the
occasion
;
when
it
became
apparent
,
that
on
the
score
of
some
family
objections
on
the
part
of
my
cousin
,
she
would
never
give
her
consent
to
what
she
termed
so
disgraceful
a
match
.
I
thought
it
my
duty
to
give
the
speediest
intelligence
of
this
to
my
cousin
,
that
she
and
her
noble
admirer
ma
be
aware
of
what
they
are
about

not

Mr

adds
,
‘
I
am
truly
rejoiced

concerned

be

genenlly
known

I
must
not

however
,
neglect

refrain
from
declaring
my
amazement

had
I
been
the
rector
of
Longbourn
,
I
should
very
strenuoust
have
opposed
it

You
ought
certainly
to
forgive

is
his

The
rest
of
his
letter
is
only
about
his
dear
Charlotte’s
situation

his
expectation
of

young

Lizzy

look

only
with
a

NSTEAD
of
receiving
any
such
letter
of
excuse
from
his
friend
,
as
Elizabeth
half
expected
Mr
Bingley
to
do

he
was
able
to
bring
Darcy
with
him
to
Lnngbourn
before
many
days
had
passed
after
Lady
Catherine’s
visit
.
The
gentlemen
arrived
early
;
and
before
Mrs
Bennet
had
time
to
tell
him
of
their
having
seen
his
aunt
,
of

daughter

not
in
the
habit
of
walking
.
Mary
could
never
spare
time
,
but
the
remaining
live
set
olf
together
.
Bingley
and
Jane
,
however
,
soon
allowed
the
others
to
outstrip
them
.
They
lagged
behind
,
while
Elizabeth
,
Kitty
,
and
Darcy
were
to
entertain
each
other
.
Very
little
was
said
b
either
:
Kitty
was
too
much
afraid
of
him
to
talk
;
E
izabeth
wan
secretly
forming
adesperate
resolution
;
and
,
perhaps
,
he
might
be
doing
the
same
.
They
walked
towards
the
Lucases
,
became

and
as
Elizabeth
saw
no
occasion
for
making
it
a
general
concern
,
when
Kitty
left
them
she
went
boldly
on
with
him
alone
.
Now
was
the
moment
for
her
reaoluta'on
to
be
executed
;
and
,
while
her
courage
was
high
,
she
immediately
said
—
—
“
Mr

,

“You

not

Lydia’s

betrayed
to

that
you
had
been
concerned
in

matter
;
and
,
of
course
,
I
could
not
rest
tillI
knew
the
particulars
.
Let
me
thank
you
again
and
again
,
in
the
name
of
Ill
my
family
,
for
that
generous
compassion
which
induced
you
to
take
so
much
trouble

so
many
mortiﬁcstions

for
the

“If
you
will
thank
me
,

he
replied
,
“
let
it
be
for
yourself

Elizabeth
was
too
much
embarrassed
to
say
a
word
.
After
a
short
pause
,
her
companion
added
,
“
You
are
too
generous
to
triﬂe
with
me

If

affections
and
wishes
are
unchanged
;
but
one
word
from
you
will
silence
me
on
this
subject
for

Elizabeth
,
feeling
all
the
more
than
common
awkwardness
and
anxiety
of
his
situation
,
now
forced
herself
to
speak
;
and
immediately
,
though
not
very
ﬂuently
,
gave
him
to
understand
that
her
sentiments
had
undergone
so
material
a
change
since
the
period
to
which
he
alluded
,
as
to
make
her
receive
with
gratitude
and
pleasure
his
present
assurances
.
The
happiness
which
this
reply
produced
was
such
as
he
had
probably
never
felt
before
,
and
he
expressed
himself
on
the
occasion
as
sensibly
and
as
warmly
as
a
man
violently
in
love
can
be
supposed
to
do

annexed
to
that
evening
,
”
said
Elizabeth
;
“the
conduct
of
neither
,
if
strictly
examined
,
will
be
irrepmachable
.
But
since
then
we
have
both
,
I
hope
,
improved
in
civility.”
“I
can
not
be
so
easily
reconciled
to
myself
.
The
recollection
of
what
I
then
said
—
~of
my
conduct
,
my
manners
,
my
expressions
during
the
whole
of
it
—
is
now
,
and
has
been
many
months
,
inexpreseibly
painful
to
me
.
Your
reproof
,
so
well
applied
,
I
shall
never
forget
:
‘Had
you
behaved
in
a
more
gentlemanlike
manner.’
Those
were
your
words
.
You
know
not
,
you
can
scarcely
conceive
,
how
they
have
tortured
me
g
—
though
it
was
some
time
,
I
confess
,
before
I
wau
reasonable
enough
to
allow
their
justice.”
“I
was
certainly
very
far
from
expecting
them
to
make
so
strong
an
impression
.
I
had
not
the
smallest
idea
of
their
being
ever
felt
in
such
a
way.”
“I
can
easily
believe
it
.
You
thought
me
then
devoid
of
every
proper
feeling
,
I
am
sure
on
did
.
The
turn
of
your
countenance
I
shall
never
orget
,
as
you
said
that
I
could
not
have
addressed
you
in
anyupoasible
way
that
would
induce
you
to
accept
me
.
l‘Oh
!
do
not
repeat
what
I
then
said
.
These
recollections
will
not
do
at
all
.
I
assure
you
,
that
I
have
long
been
most
heartily
ashamed
of
it.”
Darcy
mentioned
his
letter
.
“
Did
it
,
”
said
he
,
“
did
it
man
make
you
think
better
of
me
?
Did
you
,
on
reading
it
,
give
any
credit
to
its
contents
?
"
She
explained
what
its
effect
on
her
had
been
,
and
how
gradually
all
her
former
prejudices
had
been
removed
.
“
I
knew
,
”
said
he
,
“
that
what
I
wrote
must
give
you
pain
;
but
it
was
necessary
.
I
hope
you
have
destroyed
the
letter
.
There
was
one
part
,
especially
the
opening
of
it
,
which
I
should
dread

which

“
The
letter
sha

certainly
be
burnt
,
if
you
believe
it
essential
to
the
preservau'on
of

as
that

'
“
When
I
wrote
that
letter
,
”
replied
Darcy
,
“
I
believed
myself
perfectly
calm
and
cool
3
but
I
am
since
convinced
that
it
was
written
in
a
dreadful
bitterness
of
spirit.”
"
The
letter
,
perhaps
,
began
in
bittcmesc
;
but
it
did
not
end
so
.
The
adieu
is
charity
itself
—
But
think
no
more
of
the
letter
.
The
feelings
of
the
person
who
wrote
and
the
person
who
received
it
are
now
so
widely
different
from
what
they
were
then
,
that
every
unpleasant
circumstance
attending
it
ought
to
be
forgotten
.
You
must
learn
some
of
my
philosophy
.
—
-Think
only
of
the
past
as
its
remembrance
gives
you
leasure.”

What
do
I
not

You
taught
me
a
lesson
,
hard
indeed
at

,
but
most
advantageous
.
By
you
I
was
roperly
humbled

I
came
to
you
without
a
doubto

You
showed
me
how

I
assure

I
never

perhaps
,
at

but
my

soon
began

take

.

“I
am
almost
afraid
of

what
you
thought
of

when
we
met
at

.

blamed

”
“
No
,
indeed
,
I
felt
nothing
but
surprize
.
'
“Your
aurprize
could
not
be
greater
than
mine
in
being
noticed
by
you
.
My
conscience
told
me
that
I
deserved
no
extraordinary
politeness
,
and
I
confess
that
I
did
not
expect
to
receive
more
than
my
due

'
“
My
object
IIJHI
,
”
replied
Darcy
,
“was
to
show
you
,
by
every
civility
in
my
power
,
that
Iwns
not
no
mean
as
to
resent
the
past
;
and
I
hoped
to
obtain
your
forgiveness

to
lessen
your
ill-opinion

by
letting
ou
see
that
your
reproofs
had
been
attended

introduced
themselves
I
can
hardly
tell
,
but
I
believe
in
about
half~an
<
hour
after

had

He
then
told
her
of

in
her
acquaintance

of
her
disappointment

interruption
;
which
naturally
leading
to
the
cause
of
that
interruption
,
she
soon
lenmt
that
his
resolution
of
following
her
from
Der
shire
in
quest
of
her
sister
had
been
formed
before
e
quitted
the
inn
,
and
that
his
gravity
and
thoughtfulness
there
had
arisen
from
no
other
struggles
than
what
such
a
purpose
must
comprehend
.
She
expressed
her
gratitude
again
;
but
it
was
too
painful
a
sub'ect
to
each
to
be
dwelt
on
farther
.
'
After
waking
several
miles
in
a
leisurely
manner
,
and
too
busy
to
know
anything
about
it
,
they
found
at
last
,
on
examining
their
watches
,
that
it
was
time
to
be
at
home
.
“What
could
become
of
Mr
Bingley
and
Jane
!
”
was
a
wonder
which
introduced
the
discussion
of
tba'r
affairs
.
Darcy
was
delighted
with
their
engagement
;
his
friend
had
given
him
the
earliest
informau'on
of
it
.
“I
must
ask
whether
you
were
mrprized
?
”
mid
Elizabeth
.
“
Not
at
all
.
When
I
went
away
,
I
felt
that
it
would
soon
happen.”
“
That
is
to
say
,
you
had
given
your
permission
.
I
guessed
as
much.”
And
though
he
exclaimed
at
the
term
,
she
found
that
it
had
been
pretty
much
the
case
.
“
On
the
evening
before
my
going
to
London
,
”
said
he
,
“I
made
a
coufession
to
him
which
I
believe
I
ought
to
have
made
long
ago
.
Itold
him
of
all
that
had
occurred
to
make
my
former
interference
in
his
aﬂ‘airs
absurd
and
impertinent
.
His
surprize
was
great
.
He
had
never
had
the
slightest
suspicion
.
I
told
him
,
moreover
,
that
I
believed
myself
mistaken
in
supposing
,
as
I
had
done
,
that
your
sister
was
indifferent
to
him
;
and
as
I
could
easily
perceive
that
his
attachment
to
her
was
unabated
,
I
felt
no
doubt
of
their
happiness
together.”

at

from
all
the
others
when

She
had
only
to

in

that
had

about
till

She
coloured

neither

nor

a

feared
that
with
the
othen
it
was

which
not

At

told
her
the
motives

She
had
been
unwilling

made

from

in

All

acknowledged
,
and

spent
in

.
“

Mn

During

walk
,
it
waa
resolved
that

Bennet’e
content
should
be
asked
in
the
coune
of
the

reserved
to
herself
the
a
licadon
for

.
She
could
not

w
her

would
take
it
;
Iometimet
doubting
whether
all
hie
wealth
and
grandeur
would
be
enough
to
overcome
her
abhorrence
of
the
man
.
But
whether
she
were
violently

,
or

with
it

it
wan
certain
that
her
manner
would

to
do
credit
to
her

;
and
the
couldno
more
bear
that

In

he
approached
the

where
she
was

with

,
and
,
while
pretending
to
admire
her
work

said
in

,
“

She
was

anxious
.
“

Elizabeth
,
still
more
affected
,
was
earnest
and
solemn
in
her
reply
;
and
at
length
,
by
repeated
assurances
that
Mr
Darcy
was
really
the
object
of
her
choice
,
by
explaining
the
gradual
change
which
her
estimation
of
him
md
undergone
,
relating
her
absolute
certainty
that
his
aﬂ'ection
was
not
the
work
of
a
day
,
but
had
stood
the
test
of
many
months
suspense
,
and
enumerating
with
energy
all
his
good
qualities
,
she
did
conquer
her
father
s
incredulity
,
and
reconcile
him
to
the
match
.
“
Well
,
my
dear
,
'
said
he
,
when
she
ceased
speaking
,
“I
have
no
more
to
say
.
If
this
be
the
case
,
he
deserves
you
.
I
could
not
have
parted
with
you
,
my
Lizzy
,
to
any
one
less
worthy
.
'
To
compete
the
favourable
impression
,
she
then
told
him
what
Mr
Darcy
had
voluntarily
done
for
Lydia
.
He
heard
her
with
astonishment
.
“This
is
an
evening
of
wonders
,
indeed
!
And
so
,
Darcy
did
everything
—

up

money

not
and
storm
about
his
love
for
you
,
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
the
matter.”
He
then
recollected
her
embarrassment
a
few
days
before
,
on
his
reading
Mr
Collim’l
letter
;
and
after
laughing
at
her
sometime
,
allowed
her
at
last
to
go
,
saying
,
as
she
quilted
the
room
,
"
If
any
young
men
come
for
Mary
or
Kitty
,
send
them
in
,
for
I
am
quite
at
leisure.”
Elizabeth
s
mind
was
now
relieved
from
a
very
helvy
weight
,
and
,
after
hulf-an-hour
s
quiet
reﬂection
in
her
own
room
,
she
was
able
to
join
the
others
with
tolerable
composure
.
Everything
was
too
recent
for
gaiety
,
but
the
evening
passed
tranquilly
away
;
there
was
no
longer
anything
material
to
be
dreaded
,
and
the
comfort
of
ease
and
familiarity
would
come
in
time
.
When
her
mother
went
up
to
her
dressingoroom
at
night
she
followed
her
,
and
made
the
important
communication
.
Its
effect
was
most
extraordinary
;
for
,
on
ﬁrst
hearing
it
,
Mrs
Bennet
not
quite
still
,
and
unable
to
utter
a
syllable
.
Nor
was
it
under
many
,
man
minutes
,
that
she
could
comprehend
what
she
heard
:
though
not
in
general
backward
to
credit
what
was
for
the
advantage
of
her
family
,
or
that
came
in
the
shape
of
a
lover
to
any
of
them
.
She
began
at
length
to
recover
,
to
ﬁdget
about
in
her
chair
,
get
up
,
sit
down
again
,
wonder
,
and
bless
hemelf
.
"

And
is

really

?
Oh

and
how

!
What

Oh

!

?

This
was
enough
to
rave
that
her
approbation
need
not
be
doubted
;
and
Eliiubeth
,
re'oicing
that
such
an
eli'usion
was
heard
only
by
hersef
,
soon
went
away
.
But
before
the
had
been
three
minutes
in
her
own
room
,
her
mother
followed
her
.
"
My
dearest
child
,
'
EllL
'
cried
,
“I
can
think
of
nothing
else
!

,
and

likely

!
’Tis
as

as

!
You
must
and
shall
be
rnam'ed
by
a
special
license
!
But
.
my
dearest
love
,
tell
me
what
dish
Mr
Darcy
is
particularly
fond
of
,
that
I
may
have
it
to-morrow.”
This
was
a
sad
omen
of
what
her
mother
s
behaviour
to
the
gentleman
himself
might
be
;
and
Elizabeth
found
,
that
though
in
the
certain
lmsession
of
his
warmest
affection
.
and
secure
of
her
relations’
consent
,
the“
:
was
will
something
to
be
wished
for
.
But
the
marrow
passed
of
much
better
than
she
expected
;
for
Mrs
Bennet
luckily
stood
in
such
awe
of
her
intended
son-in-law
that
she
ventured
not
to
speak
to
him
,
unless
it
was
in
her
power
to
oﬁ'er
him
any
attention
,
or
mark
her
deference
for
his
opinion
.
Elizabeth
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
father
taking
pains
to
get
acquainted
with
him
;
and
Mr
Bennet
soon
assured
her
that
he
was
rising
every
hour
in
his
esteem
.
“I
admire
all
my
sons-in-law
highly
,
”
said
he
.
“WiCItham
,
perhaps
,
is
my
favourite
;
but
I
think
I
shall
like
your
husband
quite
as
well
as
Jane’s.”

Miss
Bingley’s
congratulations
to

approaching
marriage
were
all

aﬂ'ectionate

She
wrote
even
to
Jane
on

occasion
,
to
express
her
delight
,
and
repeat
all
her
former
professions
of
regard

Jane
was
not

she

though
feeling
no

on

,
could
not

writing

kinder

The

Four
rides
of
paper
were
inmlﬁcient
to
contain
ell
her
delight
,
and
all
her
earnest
desire
of
being
loved
by
her
sister
.
Before
any
answer
could
arrive
from
Mr
Collins
,
or
any
congratulations
to
Elizabeth
,
from
his
wife
,
the
Longhourn
family
heard
that
the
Collinses
were
come
themselm
to
Lucas
Lodge
.
The
reason
of
this
sudden
remonl
was
soon
evident
.
Lady
Catherine
had
been
rendered
so
exceediigly
angry
by
the
content
:
of
her
nephew
s
letter
,
that
harlotte
,
really
rejoicing
in
the
much

was
anxious
to
get
away
till
the
storm
wss
blown
over
.
At
such
a
moment
the
arrival
of
her
friend
won
a
sincere
pleuure
to
Elizabeth
,
though
in
the
comic
of
their
meetings
she
must
sometimes
think
the
pleasure
dearly
bought
,
when
she
saw
Mr
Darcy
exposed
to
all
the
ing
and
obsequious
civility
of
her
husband
.
He
re
it
,
however
,
with
admirable
calmness
.
He
could
even
listen
to
Sir
William
Lucas
,
when
he
complimented
him
on
carrying
away
the
brightest
ewel
of
the
country
,
and
expressed
hie
hopes
of
their
l
meeting
frequently
At

with
very
decent
composure
.
If

Mrs

,
a
greater
tax
on
his
forbearance
;
and
though

Well

stood
in

of
him
to

the

Bingley’s
good

encouraged
,
yet
,
whenever
she

she
must

vulgar

t

superior
to
what
she
had
generally
known
,
her
improvement
was
great
.
She
was
not

a
tem
er
as
Lydia
:
and
,
removed
from
the

inﬂuence
of

example
,
she
became
,
by
proper
attention
and
management
,
less
irritable
,
less
ignorant
,
and
less
insipid
.
From
the
further
disadvantage
of
Lydia’s
societ
she
was
of
course
carefully
kept
;
and
though
Mrs
ickham
frequently
invited
her
to
come
and
stay
with
her
,
with
the
promise
of
balls
and
young
men
,
her
father
would
never
consent
to
her
going
.
Mary
was
the
only
daughter
who
remained
at
home
;
and
she
was
necessarily
drawn
from
the
pursuit
of
accomplishments
by
Mrs
Bennet’s
being
quite
unable
to
sit
alone
.
Mary
was
obliged
to
mix
more
with
the
world
,
but
she
could
still
Inomlizc

;
and
as
she
was
no

mortified
by
comparisons
between
her

beauty
and
her
own
,
it
was
suspected
by
her
father
that
the
submitted
to
the
change
without
much
reluctance
.
As
for
Wiekham
and
Lydia
,
their
characters
sulfered
no
revolution
from
the
marriage
of
her
sisters
.
He
bore
with
philosophy
the
conviction
that
Elizabeth
must
now
become
acquainted
with
whatever
of
his
ingratitude
and
falsehood
had
before
been
unknown
to
her
,
and
,
in

explained
to
her
that
,
by
his

at

,
if
not
by
himself

such

was
cherished

Miss
Bingley
was
very
deeply
mortiﬁed
by
Darcy’s
marriage
;
but
as
she
thought
it
advisable
to
retain
the
right
of
visiting
st
Pemberley
,
the
dro
all
her
resentment
;
was
fender
than
ever
of
eorgiona
,
almost
as
attentive
to
Dare
as
heretofore
,
and
paid
off
every
arrenr
of
civility
to
liubeth
.
Pemberley
was
now
Georgiana
s
home
;
and
the
attachment
of
the
sisterwas
exactly
what
Darcy
had
hoped
to
see
.
They
were
able
to
love
each
other
,
even
as
well
as
they
intended
.
Georgiana
had
the
highest
cation
in
the
world
of
Elizabeth
;
though
at
ﬁrst
she
o
n
listened
with
an
astonishment
bordering
on
alarm
at
her
lively
,
sportive
manner
of
talking
to
her
brother
.
He
,
who
had
always
inspired
in
herself
a
respect
which
almost
overcame
her
affection
,
she
now
saw
the
object
of

cFleasaintry

Her
mind
received
knowledge
which
ha
never
before
fallen
in
her
way
.
By
Elizabeth’s
instructions
she
began
to
comprehend
that
a
woman
ma
take
liberties
with
her
husband
,
which
a
brother
wil
not
always
allow
in
a
sister
more
than
ten
years
younger
than
himself
.
Lady
Catherine
was
extremely
indignant
on
the
marriage
of
her
nephew
;
and
as
she
gave
way
to
all
the
genuine
frankness
of
her
character
,
in
her
reply
to
the
letter
which
announced
its
arrangement
,
she
sent
him
language
so
very
abusive
,
especially
of
Elizabeth
,
that
for
some
time
al
intercourse
was
at
an
end
.
But
at
length
,
by
Elimbeth’s
persuasion
,
he
was
prevailed
on
to
overlook
the
oﬁ'ence
,
and
seek
a
reconciliation
;
and
,
after
a
little
further
resistance
on
the
part
of
his
aunt
,
her
resentment
gave
way
,
either
to
her
affection
for
him
,
or
her
curiosity
to
see
how
his
wife
conducted
herself
:
and
she
condescended
to
wait
on
them
at
Pernberley
,
in
spite
of
that
pollution
which
its
woods
had
received
,
not
merely
from
the
rcsence
of
such
a
mistress
,
but
the
visits
of
her
uncle
an
aunt
from
the
city
.
