however	null
his	null
scientiﬁc	null

were	null
as	null
nothing	null

In	null

paradoxical	null
conceptions	null
came	null
so	null
thick	null
and	null
close	null
as	null
to	null
form	null
one	null
continuous	null
discourse	null
At	null
these	null
times	null
liewas	null
as	null
unlike	null
the	null

conception	null
of	null
a	null

Up	null

my	null

where	null
at	null
one	null

another	null
I	null
have	null
met	null
most	null
of	null
our	null
distinguished	null
literary	null
and	null
scientiﬁc	null
men	null
There	null
was	null
a	null
plain	null
dinner	null
at	null
seven	null
After	null
that	null
we	null
would	null
adjourn	null
to	null
a	null
room	null
of	null
easychairs	null
and	null
little	null
tables	null
and	null
there	null
with	null
libations	null
of	null
alcohol	null
THE	null
INVENTOR	null
3	null
and	null
reeking	null
pipes	null
we	null
would	null
invoke	null
the	null
god	null
At	null
ﬁrst	null
the	null
conversation	null
was	null
mere	null
fragmentary	null
chatter	null
with	null
some	null
local	null

silence	null

toward	null

if	null

So	null
it	null
was	null
I	null
remember	null
on	null
the	null

one	null
of	null
all—the	null
