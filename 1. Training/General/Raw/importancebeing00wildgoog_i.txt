Half Moon Street. The room is luxuriously
and artistically furnished. The sound of a
piano is heard in the adjoining room.

ANE is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and

~ ALGERNON.
Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?

, LANE.
j I didn’t think it polite to listen, sir.

,I’m sorry for that, for your sake. I don’t play

ecurately—any one can play accurately—but I play

ALGERNON.

And, speaking of the science of Life, have you
got the cucumber sandwiches cut for Lady Brack-
nell?

LANE.
Yes, sir. [Hands them on a salver.
ALGERNON.
[Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the
sofa] Oh! . . . by the way, Lane, I see from

your book that on Thursday night, when Lord
Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me,
eight bottles of champagne are entered as having
been consumed.

LANE.

Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.

ALGERNON.

Why is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the
servants invariably drink the champagne? I ask
merely for information. '

LANE.

I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine,
sir. I have often observed that in married house-
holds the champagne is rarely of a ﬁrst—rate brand.

ALGERNON.

Good Heavens! Is marriage so demoralizing as
that? ' ‘

LANE.

I believe it is a very pleasant state, sir. I have
had very little experience of it myself up to the
present. I have only been married once. That was

ALGERNON.

Yes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt
Augusta won’t quite approve of your being here.

JACK.
May I ask why?

ALGERNON.

 My dear fellow, the way you ﬂirt with Gwendolen
is perfectly disgraceful. It is almost as bad as the
way Gwendolen ﬂirts with you.

JACK.

I am in love with Gwendolen. I have come up
to town expressly to propose to her.

the excitement 'is all over. The very essence of
romance is uncertainty. If ever I getmarried, I‘ll
certainly try to forget the fact.

I have no doubt about that, dear Algy. The
Divorce Court was specially invented for people
whose memories are's’o curiously constituted.

Heaven’s sake give me back my cigarette case.
[Follows ERNEST round the room.

ALGERNON.

Yes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle?
“From little Cecily, with her fondest love to hel
dear Uncle Jack.” There is no objection, I admit,
to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no
matter what her size may be, should call her own
nephew her uncle, I can’t quite make out. Besides,
your name isn’t Jack at all; it is Ernest.

JACK.
It isn’t Ernest; it’s Jack.

ALGERNON.

You have always told me it was Ernest. I have
introduced you to every one as Ernest. You an—
swer to the name of Ernest. You look as if your
name was Ernest. You are the most earnest look-
ing person I ever saw in my life. It is perfectly
absurd your saying that your name isn’t Ernest.
It’s on your cards. Here is one of them. [Taking
it from case.] “ Mr. ErnestWorthing, B 4, The

Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to
Gwendolen, or to any one else.

, Yes, but that does not account for the fact that
your small Aunt Cecily, who lives at Tunbridge
Wells, calls you her dear uncle- Come, old boy, you
had much better have the thing, out at once.

, JACK. ,
Mydear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a
dentist. It is very vulgar to talk like a dentist when
one isn’t a dentist. It produces a false impression.

ALGERNON. 

Well, that is exactly what dentists always do.
Now,"go on! Tell me the whole thing. I may
mention that I have always suspected you of being
a conﬁrmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite
sure of it now. ' '

to inform me why you are Ernest in town and Jack,
in L the country. -

I2 [HE LVPORZAATE 0ﬁ‘BELNG.EARNE$T

JACK. '- -

My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about
my explanation at all. In fact it’s perfectly or-
dinary. Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who adopted me
when I was a little boy, made me in his will guard—
ian to his granddaughter, Miss Cecily Cardew.
Cecily, who addresses me as her uncle from motives
of respect that you could not possibly appreciate,
lives at my place in the country under the charge of
her admirable governess, Miss Prism.

ALGERNON.
Where is that place in the country, by the way?

JACK.

That is nothing to you, dear boy. You are not
going to be invited. . . I may tell you candidly
that the place is not in Shropshire.

ALGERNON.

I suspected that, my dear fellow!
buryed all over Shropshireon two separate occa-
sions. Now, go on. Why are you Ernest in town
and Jack in the country?

JACK.

My dear Algy, I don’t know whether yOu will be
able to understand my real motives. You are hardly
serious enough. When one is placed in the position
of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tOne
on all subjects. It’s one’s duty to do so. And as a
high moral tone can hardly be said to conduce very
much to either one’s health or one’s happiness, in
order to get up to town I have always pretended to
have a younger brother of the name of Ernest, who

lives in the Albany, and gets into the most dreadful
:scrapes. That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth
pure and simple.

ALGERNON.

The truth is rarely pure and never simple. Mod-
ern life would be very tedious if it were either, and
modern literature a complete impossibility !

  JACK.
That wouldn’t be at all a bad thing.

ALGERNON.

' Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fel-

 low. Don’t try it. You should leave that to people

ALGERNON.

- You have invented a very useful younger brother
icalled Ernest, in order that you may be able to come
I; up to town as often as you like. , I have invented an
invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in
“order that I may be able to go down into the country
u whenever ‘I choose. Bunbury is perfectly invalu-
ble. If itwasn’t for Bunbury’s extraordinary bad
with for instance, I wouldn’t be able to dine with
on at Willis’s to—night,’for I have been really en-
j-gaged to Aunt Augusta for more than a week.

 
 

 

 

14 THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ,EARNEST

JACK.

I haven’t asked you to dine with me anywhere
to-night.

ALGERNON.

I know. You are absurdly careless about send-
ing out invitations. It is very foolish of you.
Nothing annoys people so‘much as not receiving
invitations.

JACK.

You had much better. dine with your Aunt
Augusta.

ALGERNON.

I haven’t the smallest intention of doing anything
of the kind. To begin with, I dined there on Mon-
day, and once a week is quite enough to dine with
one’s own relations. In the second place, whenever
I do dine there I am always treated as a member of
the family, and sent down with either no woman at
all, or two. In the third place, I know perfectly
well whom she will place me next to, to—night. She
will place me next Mary Farquhar, who always ﬂirts
with her own husband across the dinne-rvtable.
That is not very pleasant. Indeed, it is not even
decent . . . and that sort of thing is enor-
mously on the increase. The amount of women in
London who ﬂirt with their'own husbands is per-
fectly scandalous.‘ It looks so bad, It is simply
washing one’s clean linen in public. Besides, now
that I know you to; be a conﬁrmed Bunburyist I
naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying. I
want to tell you the rules; , . r L ‘

JACK.

I’m not a Bunbu-ryist at all. If Gwendolen ac-
cepts me, I am going to kill my brother, indeed I
think I’ll kill him in any case. Cecily is a little too
much interested in him. It is rather a bore. So I
am going to get rid of Ernest. And I strongly ad-
vise you to do the same with Mr. . . . with
your invalid friend who has the absurd name.

ALGERNON.

Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and

* if you ever [get married, which seems to me ex-

tremely problematic, you will be very glad to know

Bunbury. A man who marries without knowing
Bunbury has a very tedious time of it.

JACK.

That is nonsense. If I marry a charming girl
like Gwendolen, and she is the only girl I ever saw
in my life that I would marry, I certainly won’t

. want to know Bunbury.

ALGERNON.

V Then your wife will. You don’t seem‘to realize
that in married life three is company and two is
none. ‘

JACK.

[Sententiausly] That,ymy dear young friend, is
the theory that the corrupt French-Drama has been
propounding for the last ﬁfty years.

about. .[The sound of an electric bell is heard.]

Now, if I get her out of the way for ten minutes,
so that you can have an opportunity for proposing

he was going to live or to die. This shilly—shallying
with the question is absurd. Nor do I in any way
approve of the modern sympathy with invalids. I
consider it morbid. Illness of any kind is hardly a
thing to be encouraged in others. Health is the
primary duty of life. I am always telling that to
your poor uncle, but he never seems to take much
notice . . . as far as any improvement in his
ailments goes. I should be much obliged if you
would ask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough
not to have a relapse on Saturday, for I rely on you
to arrange my music for me. It is my last reception
and one wants something that will encourage con-
versation, particularly at the end of the season when
every one has practically said whatever they had to
say, which, in most cases, was probably not much.

ALGERNON.

I’ll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still
conScious, and I think I can promise you he’ll be all
right by Saturday. Of course the music is a great
difﬁculty. You see, if one plays good music, people
don’t listen, and if one plays bad music people don’t
talk. But I’ll run over the program I’ve drawn
out, if you will kindly come into the next room for

Yes, I am quite aware of the fact. And I often.
wish that in public, at any rate, you had been more
demonstrative. For me you have always had an
irresistible fascination. Even before I met you I
was far from indifferent to you. [JACK looks at
her in amazement] We live, as I hope you know,
Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals. Thefact is con-
stantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly
magazines, and has reached, the provincial pulpits
I am told; and my ideal has always been to love
some one of the name of Ernest. There is some-
thing in that name that inspires, absolute conﬁdence.

he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined
to love you.

Personally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I
 don’t much care about the name of Ernest . . .

Jack? . . . No, there isvery little music in
the name Jack, if any at all, indeed. It does not
thrill. It produces absolutely no vibrations. . . ‘
I; have known several Jacks, and they all, without
exception, were more than usually plain. Besides,
Jack is a notorious domesticity for John! And I
pity any woman who is married to a man called
John. She would probably never be allowed to

mean we must get married at once. There is no
time to be lost.

GWENDOLEN.
Married, Mr. Wei-thing?

JACK.

[Astoundezi] Well . . . surely. You know
that I love you, and you led me to believe, Miss
Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indiﬂerent
to me. ,

GWENDOLEN.

I adore you. But you haven’t proposed to me
yet. Nothing has been said at all about marriage.
The subject has not even been touched on. '

JACK.
Well . . . may I propose to you now?

GWENDOLEN.

I think it would be an admirable opportunity.
And to spare you any possible disappointment, Mr.
Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you quite
frankly beforehand that I am fully determined to
accept you. '

JACK.

GWENDOLEN.

Yes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say
to me?

GWENDOLEN.

Of course I will, darling. How long you have
, been about it! I am afraid you have had very little
experience in how to propose.

JACK.

My own one, have never loved any one in the
world but you.

GWENDOLEN.

Yes, but men often propose for practice. I know
my brother Gerald does. All my girl-friends tell
me so. What wonderfully blue eyes you have,
Ernest! They are quite, quite blue. I hope you
will always look at me just like that, especially when
there are other people present.

Pardon me, you are not engaged to any one.
When you do become engaged to some one, I, or
your father, should his health permit him, will in-
form you of the fact. An engagement should come
on a young girl as a surprise, pleasant or unpleasant,
as the case may be. It is hardly a matter that she
could be allowed to arrange for herself. . .

JACK.
[After some hesitation] I know nothing, Lady
Brackneli. '

LADY BRACKNELL.

I am pleased to hear it. I do not approve of any-
thing that tampers with natural ignorance. Igno—
rance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and
the bloom is gone. The whole theory of modern
education is radically unsound. Fortunately in
England, at any rate, education produces no effect
whatsoever. If it did, it would prove a serious
danger to the upper classes, and probably lead to
acts of violence in Grosvenor Square. What is your
income? - '

JACK.
Between seven and eight thousand a year.

LADY BRACKNELL.

[Makes a note in her 170075.] In land, or inkin-
vestments?

JACK.
In investments, chieﬂy.

LADY BRACKNELL.

That is satisfactory. What between the duties
expected of one during one’s lifetime, and the duties
exacted from one after one’s death, land has ceased
to be either a proﬁt or a pleasure. It gives‘one
position, and prevents one from keeping it up.
That’s all that can be said about land.

JACK.

I have a country house with some land, of course,
attached to it, about ﬁfteen hundred acres, I ,be—

A country house! How many bedrooms? Well,
that point can be cleared up afterwards. You have
a town house, I hope? A girl with a simple, un-

Spoiled nature,like Gwendolen, could hardly be ex-
pected‘to reside in the country.

JACK.
L Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it
is let by the year to Lady Bloxham. Of course, I
can get it back whenever I like, at six months’

Or come in the evening, at any rate. Now to minor

I have lost both my parents.

LADY BRACKNELL.

Both? . . . That seems like carelessness. Who
was your father? He was evidently a man of some
wealth. Was he born in what the Radical papers
call the purple of commerce, or did he rise from the
ranks of the aristocracy?

JACK.

I am afraid I really ‘don’t know. The fact is,
Lady Bracknell, I said I had lost my parents. It
would be nearer the truth to say that my parents
seem to have lost me . . . Idon’t actually know

JACK.

The late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman
of a very charitable and kindly disposition, found
me, and gave me the name of Worthing, because he
happened to have a ﬁrst-class ticket for Worthing
in his pocket at the time. Worthing is a place in
Susisex. It is a. seaside resort;

LADY BRACKNELL.

Where did the charitable gentleman who had a
ﬁrst-class ticket for this seaside resort ﬁnd you?

JACK.
‘ [Gravely] In a hand-bag.

 r LADY BRACKNELL:
A hand-bag?

JACK.

[V ery seriously] Yes, Lady Braclmell. I was
in a hand—bag—a somewhat large, black leather
hand-bag, with handles to it—an ordinary hand-bag
in fact.

LADY BRACKNELL.

I - y In what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas,
JQ-ardew come across this ordinary hand—bag?

JACK.

In the cloak-room at Victoria Station. It was
given to him in mistake for his own.

 

M , , LADY BRACKNELL.
The cloak-room at Victoria Station?

 

32 THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST

JACK.
Yes. The Brighton line.

LADY BRACKNELL.

The line is immaterial. Mr. Worthing, I confess
I feel somewhat bewildered, by what you have just
told me. To be born, or at any rate bred, in a hand-
bag, whetherit had handles or not, seems to me to
display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of
family life that remind one of the worst excesses
of the French Revolution. And I presume. you
know what that unfortunate movement led to? As
for the particular locality in which the hand-bag
was found, a cloak~room at a railway station might
serve to conceal 'a social indiscretionnhas probably,
indeed, been used for that purpose before now—but
it could hardly be regarded as an assured basis for
a recognized position in good society. '

JACK.

May I ask you then What you would advise me
to do? I need hardly say I would do anything in
the world to insure Gwendolen’s happiness.

LADY BRACKNELL.

I would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to
try and acquire some relatiOn-s as soon as possible,
and to make a deﬁnite effort to produce at any rate
one parent, of either sex, before the season is quite
over.

JACK.

Well, I don’t see how I could possibly manage to
do that. I can produce the hand-bag at any moment. '
It is in my dressing—room at home. I really think ;
that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.

LADY BRACKNELL.

Me, sir! What has itgto do with me? You can

dream of allowing our only daughter—a girl brought
up with the utmost care—to marry into a cloak-
room, and form an alliance with a parcel? Good-

 Oh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet. As far as
r she is concerned, we are engaged. Her mother is
perfectly unbearable. Never met such a Gorgon

Memory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all

 ALGERNON. 
No; the appointment is in London.

CECILY.

Well, I know, of course, how important it is not
to keep a business engagement, if one wants to re-
tain any sense of the beauty of life, but still I think
you had better wait till Uncle Jack arrives. I know
he wants to speak to you about your emigrating.

ALGERNON.
About my what?

CECILY.  
Your emigrating. He has gone up to buy your
outﬁt.
ALGERNON.

I certainly wouldn’t let Jack buy my outﬁt. He
has no taste in neckties at all.

Jack is sending you to Australia. '

to reform me. You might make that your mission,

or, as in the present case, distressing. [All sigh]
I have preached it at harvest celebrations, christen-
ings, conﬁrmations, on days of humiliation and festal
days. The last time I delivered it was in the Cathe-
dral, as a charity sermon on behalf of the Society
for the Prevention of Discontent among the Upper
Orders. The Bishop, who was present, was much
struck by some of the analogies I drew.

wicked and bad, you of course have formed the
chief topic of conversation between myself and Miss

must be something in him after all. I daresay it
was foolish of me, but I fell in love with you, Ernest.

ALGERNON.

settled E’ r '

CECILY.

entire ignorance of my existence, I determined to
end the matter one way or the other, and after a long
struggle with myself I accepted you under this dear

GWENDOLEN.

Perhaps this might be a favorable opportuntiy for
my mentioning who I am. My father is Lord
Bracknell. You have never heard of papa, I sup—
pose?

CECILY.
I don’t think so.

GWENDOLEN.

Outside the family circle, papa, I am glad to say,
is entirely unknown. I think that is quite as it
should be. The home seems to me to be the proper
sphere for the man. And certainly once a man be—
gins to neglect his domestic duties he becomes pain-
fully effeminate, does he not? And I don’t like that.
It makes men so very attractive. Cecily, mamma,
whose views on education are remarkably strict, has
brought me up to be extremely short-sighted; it is-
part of her system; so do you mind my looking at
you through my glasses?

CECILY.

Oh! not at all, Gwendolen. I am very fond of
beinglooked at. *

GWENDOLEN.

lorgnette.] You are here On a short visit, I suppose.

CECILY.

Oh, no i I have no mother, nor, in fact, any
relations. '

 GWENDOLEN.
Indeed ?
' CECILY.

My dear guardian, with the assistance of Miss
Prism, has the arduous task of looking after me.

GWENDOLEN,
Your guardian?

 I CECILY.
Yes, I am Mr. Worthing’s ward.

GWENDOLEN.

L Oh! It is strange he never mentioned to me that
he had a ward. How secretive of him! He grows
more interesting hourly. I am not sure, however,

 that the news inspires me with feelings of unmixed
delight. [Rising and going to her.] ,I am very
, fond-of you, Cecily; I have liked you ever since I
~mety0u! But I am bound to state that now that I
know that you are Mr. Worthing’s ward, I cannot
[help expressing a wish you were—well just a little
older than you seem to be—and not quite so very
alluring, in appearance. In fact, if I may speak
candidly— ‘ ‘ .

 

80, THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING IVEARNES‘T.

CECILY.

Pray do! I think that whenever one has any-
thing unpleasant to say, one should always be quite
candid.

GWENDOLEN.

Well, to speak with perfect candor, Cecily, I wish
that you were fully forty-two, and more than usually
plain for your age. Ernest has a strong upright
nature. He is the very soul of truth and honor.
Disloyalty would be as impossible to him as decep-
tion. But even men of the noblest possible moral
character are extremely susceptible to the inﬂuence
of the physical charms of others. Modern, no less
than Ancient History, supplies us with many most
painful examples of what I refer to. If it were not
so, indeed, History would be quite unreadable.

CECILY.
I beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did you say
Ernest? ‘

GWENDOLEN.
Yes.

CECILY.

Oh, but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is my
guardian. It is his brother—his elder brother.

GWENDOLEN.

[Sitting down again] Ernest never mentioned
to me that he had a brother. ‘

CECILY.

I am sorry to say they have not been on
terms for a long time.

GWENDOLEN.

'* Ah! that accounts for it. And now that I think
of it I have never heard any man mention his
brother. The subject seems distasteful to most men.
Cecily, you have lifted a load from my mind. I was
growing almost anxious. It would have been ter-
rible if any cloud had come across a friendship like
ours,.would it not? Of course you are quite, quite
sure that it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is your
guardian ?

CECILY.

Quite sure. [A pause] In fact, I am going to
be his.

 GWENDOLEN.
[Enquiringly] I beg you? Pardon?

CECILY.

[Rather shy and conﬁdingly.] Dearest Gwendo—
len, there is no reason why I should make a secret
of it to you. Ourrlittle county newspaper is sure
to. chronicle the fact next week. Mr. Ernest Worth—
ing and I are engaged to be married.

GWENDOLEN.
 [Quite politely, rising] My darling Cecily, I
think there must be some slight error. Mr. Ernest

Worthing is engaged to me. The announcement

, will appear in the Morning Post on Saturday at the

CECILY.

[Very politely, rising] I, am afraid you must be
under some misconception. Ernest proposed to me ‘
exactly ten minutes ago.  [Shows diary.

[Produces diary of her own] 'I never travel with-
out my diary. One should always have something
sensational to read in the train. I am so sorry, dear
Cecily, if it is any disappointment to you, but I am
afraid I have the prior claim.

CECILY. 
It would distress me more than I can tell you,
dear Gwendolen, if it caused you any mental or
physical anguish, but I feel bound to point out that

since Ernest proposed to youhe clearly has changed
his mind.

GWENDOLEN.

[M editatively.] If the poor fellow has been en-
trapped into any foolish promise I shall consider it
my duty to rescue him at‘once, and with a ﬁrm hand.

CECILY.

[Thoughtfully and sadly] Whatever unfor—
tunate entanglement my dear boy may have got into,
I will never reproach him with it after we are
married. '

GWENDOLEN.

Do you allude to me, Miss Cardew, as an en-
tanglement? You are presumptuous. On an oc-'
‘ casion of this kind it becomes more than a moral
duty to speak one’s mind. It becomes a pleasure. , ; «

[Slowly and hesitatlngly] Gwendolen—Cecily—
it is very painful for me to be forced to speak the
truth. It is the ﬁrst time in my life that I have ever
been reduced to such a painful position, and I am
really quite inexperienced in doing anything of the
kind. However, I will tell you quite frankly that I
have no brother Ernest. I have no brother at all.
I never had a brother in my life, and I certainly
have not the smallest intention of ever having one
in the future. ,

quite so frequently as your wicked custom was.
And not a bad thing either.

Ernest. Gwendolen would wish it. We can’t both
3e christened Ernest. It’s absurd. Besides, I have
a. perfect right to be christened if I like. There is
no evidence at all that I ever have been christened
by anybody. I should think it extremely probable I
never was, and so does Dr. Chasuble. It is entirely
different in ybur case. You have been christened
already. ‘

ALGERNON.
Yes, but I have not been christened for years.

JACK.
Yes, but you have been christened. That is the
important thing.

ALGERNON.

Quite so. So I know my constitution can stand
it. If you are not quite sure about your ever having
been christened, I must say I think it rather danger-
ous your venturing on it now. It might make you
very unwell. You can hardly have forgotten that
some one very closely connected with you was very

He seems to have hadgreat conﬁdence in the
opinion of his physicians. I am glad, hOWever, that
he made up his mind at the last to some deﬁnite
course of action, and acted under proper medical
advice. And now that we have ﬁnally got rid of
this Mri Bunbury, may I ask, Mr. VWOrthing, who
is that young person whose hand my nephew Alger~
non is now holding in what seems to me a peculiarly
unnecessary manner?

JACK. 
That lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward.
[LADY BRACKNE‘LL bows coldly to CECILY.

ALGERNON.

I am engaged to be married to Cecily, Aunt
Augusta.

LADY BRACKNELL.
I beg your pardon?

CECILY.

Mr. Moncrieﬁ‘ and I are engaged to be married,
Lady Bracknell.

LADY BRACKNELL.

[With a shiver, crossing to-the sofa and sitting
down] I do not know whether there is anything
peculiarly exciting in the air of this particular part
of Hertfordshire, but the number of engagements
that go on seems to me considerably above the
proper average that statistics have laid down for our
guidance. I think some preliminary inquiry on my
part would not be out of place. Mr. Worthing, is

Miss Cardew at all connected With, any of the larger
railway stations in London? I merely desire in:
formation. Until yesterday I had no idea that there
were any families or persons whose origin was a
Terminus. I
[JACK looks perfectly furious, but restrains
himself. ‘

JACK.

[In a clear, cold mica] Miss Cardew is the
granddaughter of the late Mr. Thomas Cardew of
I49, Belgrave Square, S. W. ; Gervase Park, Dork-
ing, Surrey; and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N. B.

' LADY BRACKNELL.

That sounds not unsatisfactory. Three addresses
I always inspire conﬁdence, even in tradesmen. But
’ what proof have I of their authenticity?

JACK.

I have carefully preserved the Court Guides of

the period. They are open to your inspection, Lady
,Bracknell.

LADY BRACKNELL.
 [Grimly] I have known strange errors in that
publication.
' JACK.

‘ ’iMis's Cardew’s family solicitors are Messrs.
‘Markby, Markby, and Markby.

 

LADY BRACKNELL.

’Markby, Markby, and Markby! A ﬁrm of the
-,'very;highest, position in their profession. Indeed I

am told that one of the Mr. Markbys is occasionally
to be seen at dinner parties. So far I am satisﬁed.

JACK.

[Very irritably.] How extremely kind of you,
Lady Bracknell! I have also in my possession, you
will be pleased to hear, certiﬁcates of Miss Cardew’s
birth, baptism, whooping cough, registration, vac-
cination, conﬁrmation, and the measles; both the
German and the English variety.

LADY BRACKNELL.

Ah! A life crowded with incident, I see; though
perhaps somewhat too exciting for a young girl. I
am not myself in favor of premature experiences.
[Risesy looks at her watch] Gwendolen! the time-
approaches for our departure. We have not a mo‘
ment to lose. As a matter of form, Mr. Worthing,
I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any little
fortune 3

JACK.

Oh! about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds
in the Funds. That is all. Good-bye, Lady Brack-
nell. So pleased to have seen you. '

LADY BRACKNELL.

[Sitting down again] A moment, Mr. Worthing.‘
A hundred and thirty thousand pounds! And in
the Funds! Miss Cardew seems to me a most at-
tractive young lady, now that I look at her. Few
girls of the present. day have any really solid
qualities, any of the qualities that last, and improve
with time. Welive, I regret to say, in an agent
surfaces. [To CECILY.] Come over here, edear.

[CECILY goes across] Pretty child! your dress is
sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as Nature
might have left it. But we can soon alter all that.
A, thoroughly experienced French maid produces a
really marvelous result in a very brief space ’of
time- I remember recommending one to young
Lady Lancing, and after three months her own hus-
band did not knowher.

JACK.
[Aside] And after six months nobody knew her.

, LADY BRACKNELL.

'[Glares at JACK for a few moments. Then bends,
with a practiced smile, to CECILY.] Kindly turn
round, sweet child. [CECILY tm’m completely
round] No, the side View is what I want.
[CECILY presents her proﬁle] Yes, quite as I ex—
pected. There are distinct social possibilities in
your proﬁle. The two weak points in our age are
its want of principle and its want of proﬁle. The
chin a‘ little higher, dear. Style largely depends on
the way the chin is worn. They are worn very
high, just at present. Algernon!

ALGERNON. ‘
Yes, Aunt Augusta!

LADY BRACKNELL.
There are distinct social possibilities in Miss Car.
dew’s proﬁle. ‘
ALGERNON.
' Cecily is the sweetest, dearest, prettiest girl in the

‘Lwhole world. And I don’t care twopence about
social possibilities.

LADY BRACKNELL. f

Never speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon.
Only people who can’t get into it do that. -[To-
CECILY.] Dear child, of course you know that
Algernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon.
But I do not approve of mercenary marriages.
When I marriedLord Bracknell I had no fortune of
any kind. But I never dreamed for a moment of

allowing that to stand in my way. Well, I suppose
I must give my consent.

L ALGERNON.
Thank you, Aunt Augusta.

LADY BRACKNELL.
Cecily, you may kiss me!

[Kisses hen] Thank you, Lady Bracknell.

You may also address me as Aunt Augusta for

soon.* I

.' 'IHPORTANCE OF BEING EAR/VEST mg ‘

LADY BRACKNELL.

‘To Speak frankly, I am not in favor of long en-
gagements. They give people the opportunity of
ﬁnding out each 'other’s character before marriage,
which I‘ think is never advisable.

JACK.

I beg your pardon for interrupting you, Lady
Bracknell, but this engagement is quite out of the
question. I am Miss Cardew’s guardian, and she
cannot marry without my consent until she comes of
age. That consent I absolutely decline to give.

LADY BRACKNELL.

Upon what grounds, may I ask? Algernon is an
extremely, I may almost say an ostentatiously,
eligible young man. He has nothing, but he looks
everything. What more can one desire?

JACK.

It pains me very much to have to speak frankly
to you, Lady Bracknell, about your nephew, but the
fact is that I do not approve at all of, his moral
character. I suspect him of being untruthful.

[ALGERNON and CECILY look- at him in m-
dignant amazement.

LADY BRACKNELL.
‘ Untruthful! 'My nephew Algernon? Impos-
,‘ sible! He is an Oxonian.

I fear there 'can be no possible doubt about the
matter. This afternoon, during my temporary ab‘

sence in London on an important question of re:
mance, he obtained admission to my house by means
of the false pretence of being my brother. Under
an assumed name he drank, I’ve just been informed
by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier—
Jouet, Brut, ’89; a wine I was specially reserving for
myself. Continuing his disgraceful deception, he
succeeded in the course of the afternoon in alienat-
ing the affections of my only ward. He subse»
quently stayed to tea, and devoured every single
mufﬁn. And what makes his conduct all the more
heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from
the ﬁrst that I have no brother, that I never had a
brother, and that I don’t intend to have a brother,
not even of any kind. I distinctly told him so my— '
self yesterday afternoon. I

LADY BRACKNELL.

Ahem! Mr. Worthing, after careful considera-
tion I have decided entirely to overlook my nephew’s
conduct to you.

JACK.

That is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell.
My own decision, however, is unalterable. I decline
to give my consent.

LADY BRACKNELL.

[To CECILY.] Come here, sweet child. ' [CECILY
goes oven] How old are you, dear?

CECILY.

Well, I am really onlyeighteen, but I always ad-
mit to twenty when I go to evening parties.

 

 

THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST III 

LADY BRACKNELL.

You are, perfectly right in making some slight
alteration. Indeed, no woman should ever be quite
accurate, about her age. It looks so calculating.
. . [In a meditative manner] Eighteen, but
admitting to twenty at evening parties. Well, it will
notbe very long before you are of age and free from

,the restraints of tutelage. So I don’t think your
guardian’s consent is, after all, a matter of any im—\
I portance. r

JACK.

, Pray excuse me, Lady Bracknell, for interrupting
. you again, but it is only fair to tell you that accord-
ing tothe terms of her grandfather’s will Miss Car-
dew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-
ﬁve.
LADY BRACKNELL.

That does not seem to me to be a grave objection.
Thirty-ﬁve is a very attractiVe age. London society
is full of women of the very highest birth who have,
of their own free choice, remained thirty—ﬁve for

‘ years. Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point.
To my own knowledge she has been thirty-ﬁve ever
since she arrived at the age of forty, which was
many years ago now. I see no reason why our dear
Cecily should not be even still more attractive at the

I ,age you mention than she is at present. There will

he a large accumulation of property.

~ CE’CILY.
Algy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-ﬁve?

, ALGERNON. 
Of course I could, Cecily. Youknow I could.

 

112 THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARIVEST

CECILY.

Yes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn’t wait all
that time. I hate waiting even ﬁve minutes for
anybody. It always makes me rather cross. I am
not punctual myself, I know, but Irdo like punctu—
ality in others, and waiting,- even to be married, is
quite out of the question.

ALGERNON.
Then what is to be done, Cecily?

CECILY.
I don’t know, Mr. Moncrieﬁ.

LADY BRACKNELL.

My dear Mr. Worthing, as Miss Cardew states
positively that she cannot wait till she is thirty—ﬁve—
a remark which I am bound to say seems to me to
show a somewhat impatient nature—I would beg of
you to reconsider your decision.

JACK.

But my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is en-
tirely in your own hands. The moment you consent
to my marriage with Gwendolen, I will most gladly
allow your nephew to form an alliance with my
ward. ‘ ,

LADY BRACKNELL. V
[Rising and drawing herself up.] You must be
quite aware that what you propose is out of the
question. ‘
JACK.

Then a passionate celibacy is all that any of us 
can look forward to. ‘ -

 

 

  
 
 

THE'IMPORTA/VCE OF BEING EARNEST n3

LADY BRACKNELL.

That is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen.
Algernon, of course, can choose for himself. [Pulls
out her watch] Come, dear [GWENDOLEN rises] ;

- we have already missed ﬁve, if not six, trains. To
miss any more might expose us to comment on the

platform.
[Enter DR. CHASUBLE.

 CHASUBLE. 
Everything is quite ready for the christenings.

I LADY BRACKNELL.
The christenings, sir! Is not that somewhat pre—
mature?
CHASUBLE.

[Looking rather puzzled, and pointing to JACK
and ALGERNON.) Both these gentlemen have ex—
pressed a desire for immediate baptism.

LADY BRACKNELL.
At their age? The idea is grotesque and irre~
ligious! Algernon, I forbid you to be baptized. I
‘ will not hear of such excesses. Lord Bracknell
' would be highly displeased if he learned that that
‘was the way in which you wasted your time and
money.

CHASUBLE.

Am I to understand then that there are to be no
christenings at all this afternoon?

~  JACK.
I don’t think that, as things are now, it would be
of much practical valu5t9 either of us, Dr. Chasuble.

114 THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST

CHASUBLE}

I am grieved to hear such sentiments from you,
Mr. Worthing. They savorof the heretical Views of
the Anabaptists, views that I have completely refuted
in four of my unpublished sermons. However, as
your present mood seems to be one peculiarly 
secular, I will return to the church at once. In-
deed, I have just been informed by the pew—opener
that for the last hour and a half Miss Prism has
been waiting for me in the vestry.

LADY BRACKNELL.

[Starting] Miss Prism! Did I hear you men-
tion a Miss Prism? r

CHASUBLE.

Yes,,Lady Bracknell.‘ I am on my way to join
her. '

LADY BRACKNELL.

Pray allow me to detain you for a moment. This
matter may prove to be one of vital importance to
Lord Bracknell and myself. Is this Miss Prism a
,female of repellent aspect, remotely connected with
education?

CHASUBLE.

[Somewhat ind-ignantly.] She is the most culti-
vated of ladies, and the very picture of respect‘
ability. ' 

LADY BRACKNELL.

It is «obviously the same'person. May I ask what
positionshe holds in your household?

In spite of what I hear of her, I must see her at

round as if desirous to escape.

‘*ner.] Prism! Where is that baby? [General
consternation. The Canon starts back in horror.
ALGERNON and JACK pretend to be anxious to shield
‘ I CECILY and GWENDOLEN from hearing the details of
a- terrible public scandal.] Twenty-eight years ago,

 

:16 THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EAazvgsr

Prism, you left Lord Bracknell’s house, Number
104, Upper Grosvenor Street, in charge of a per-
ambulator that contained a baby, of the male sex.
You never returned. A few weeks later, through
the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan
police, the perambulator was discovered at mid.—
night, standing by itself in a remote corner of Bays-
water. It contained the manuscript of a three- '
volume novel of more than usually revolting senti-
mentality. [MIss PRISM starts in involuntary in-
dignation] But the baby was not there! [Every
one looks at MISS PRISM.] Prism, where is that
baby? [A pause.

MISS PRISM.

Lady Bracknell, I admit with shame that I do not
know. I only wish I dld. The plain facts of the
case are these. On the morning of the day you
mention, a day that is forever branded on my
memory, I prepared as usual to take the baby out
in its perambulator. I had also with me a some-
what old, but capacious hand-bag in which I had
intended to place the manuscript of a work of ﬁction
that I had written during my few unoccupied hours.
In a moment of mental abstraction, for which I
never can forgive myself, I deposited the manu—

script in the bassinette, and placed the baby in the
hand-bag.

JACK. ,

‘ [Who has been listening attentively] But where
did you deposit the hand—bag?

MISS PRISM.
Do not-ask me, Mr. Worthing.

Miss Prism, this is a matter of no small im-

convincing. * *

in his hand.

JACK.

[Rushing over to MIss PRISM.] Is this the hand—
bag, Miss Prism? Examine it carefully before you
speak. The happiness of more than one life de-
pends on your answer.

MISS PRISM.

[C dimly] It seems to be mine. Yes, here is the
injury it received through the upsetting of a Govver
Street omnibus in younger and happier days. Here 
is the stain on the lining caused by-the explosion of

mine. I am delightedto have it so unexpectedly
restored to me. It has been a great inconvenience
being without it all these years. ‘
