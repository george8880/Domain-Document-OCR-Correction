ON HORSELL COMMON.

' I FOUND a little crowd of perhaps twenty people
‘ surrounding'the huge hole in which the cylinder
y. Ihave already described the appearance
1' that colossal bulk, imbedded in the ground.
The turf and gravel about it seemed charred as
"f by a sudden explosion. No doubt its impact
1L had caUsed a ﬂash of ﬁre. Henderson and
gilvy were not there. I think they perceived

andhad gone away to breakfast at Henderson’s
house.

There were four or ﬁve boys sitting on the ,
«‘ edge of'the pit, with their feet dangling, and
amusing themselves—until I stopped them—by
:‘throwing stones at the giant mass. After I,"
ghad spoken to them‘about it, they began play;

 

standers. r , ,

Among these were a couple of I cyclists, .r-a'

VLing‘,at"touch’ in, and out of the group of by- ~

talking; Few of the commoﬂ peoplein Engv

land had anything but the vaguest astronomical

f ideas in those'days. Mosto’f them were staring

quietly at the big table-like end of theyeylindet,

Which was, still as Ogilvy and H enderson «had i

(left it. I'fancy the popular expectation of a

.heap of charred corpses was disappointed at
this inanimatebulk. Some went away while ,1
was there, and other people came. ,I clambered‘
into ‘the pit and fancied I heard a faint m‘ove‘
ment‘under my feet. The top‘had certainly
ceased to rotate. . I ‘ ' ,

the strangeness of this object was at all evident

THE DAYS OF IMPRISONMENT.

‘ICT’HE arrival of a second Fighting Machine -’
drove us from our peephole into the scullery',  I, “
i-for we feared that from his elevation the
rMartian might see down upon us behind our
barrier. At a later date we began to feel less '; I
n danger of their eyes, for to an eye in the ‘

"dazzle of the sunlight outside our refuge must
have seemed a blind of blackness, but at ﬁrst
he slightest suggestion of approach drove us
into the scullery in heartthrobbing retreat.
"Yet, terrible as was the danger we incurred,
the attraction of peeping was for both of us
trirresistible. And I recall now with a sort"of ' ‘

V.
THE STILLNESS.

' MY ﬁrst act, before I went into the pantry, was L
. to fasten the door between kitchen and scullery. ,
But the pantry was empty; every scrap of’ food 7
 had gone. Apparently, the Martian had takem
' 7 it all on the previous day. At that discovery I r
,‘ despaired for the ﬁrst time. I took no food and r
, no drink either on the eleventh or the twelfth ’-
day. - , ’
At ﬁrst my mouth and throat were parched, \ ,
and my strength ebbed sensibly. I sat about 5 "
in the darkness of the scullery, in a state of
gigdespondent wretchedness. My mind ran on i.
‘f eating; I thought I had become deaf, for the r t ,
J noises of movement I had been accustomedlto ‘
' hear from the pit ceased absolutely. I did not“ L’
feel strong enough to trawl noiselessly to the
peeph’ole,»or I would have gone there.
On the twelfth day my throat was so painful”
that, taking the chance of alarming the Martians, I . ‘
I. attacked the creaking rain-water pump «that “

 

 

 

 

 

   
 
  
   
 

 

 

 
    

4 The, ofthe Winn;

stod bythesink, and got a couple of glad

of blackened and tainted rain-water. I: w

,, greatly refreshed by "this, and emboldened

" ‘ the fact that no inquiring tentacle followed t
noise of my pumping.  

.During' these days I thought much oft
:eurateyand of the manner of his death,’ in
.rambling, inconclusive manner. 

i ' On the thirteenth day I drank some m'or,
Water, and dozed and thought disjointedly'r’
eating and of vague impossible plans of escape;

, Whenever I dozed,1 dreamt of horrible pha

~ taéms, of the death of the curate, Or , I,

" sumptuous dinners; but, sleeping or awake,

“ felt a keen pain that urged me to‘drink age A

[and again. The light that came, into the *i
scullery was no longer grey but red. (Torm ‘

, disordered imagination it seemed the colour

,- blood. ' ‘

.. On the fourteenth dayI went into the kite

and I was surprised to ﬁnd that the fronds:

L the Red Weed had grown right across the-ho

in the wall, turning the half-light of the p'

" into a crimson—coloured obscurity. .

‘ memberyto have done since my last argument

with the curate. During all the intervening
time my mental condition had been a hurrying
succession of vague emotional states, or a sort
of stupid receptivity. But in the night my
brain, reinforced, I suppose, by the food I had

 eaten, grew clear again, and l thought.

Three things struggled for possession of my

, mind : the killing of the curate, the whereabouts I
of the Martians, and the possible fate of my

* wife.

The former gave me no sensation of
horror or remorse to recall ; I saw it simply as

 a thing done, a memory inﬁnitely disagreeable,

mbut quite without the quality‘of remorse.

' saw myself then as I see myself now, driven
' step ,by step towards that hasty blow, the

 

 
 

creature of a sequence of accidents leading
inevitably to that. I felt no condemnation;
yet the memory, static, unprogressive, haunted
me.

The morning was bright and ﬁne, and the

‘ . Dead London

It was already‘past noon. Why'was I
f vandEring alone in this city of the dead? r
Why was I alone when all London was lying in
M state, and in its black shroud? I felt intolerably
glonely. My mind ran on old friends that I had
forgotten for years. I thought of the poisons
' "in the chemists’ shops, of the liquors the wine—
'Imerchants stored; I recalled thetwo sodden
creatures of despair who, so far as I knew,
i ‘ Vshared the city with myself. . . .
I came into Oxford Street by the Marble
gArCh, and here again was black powder and
‘‘se'veral bodies, and an evil, ominous smell from
the gratings of the cellars of some of the
iii-houses. I grew very thirsty after the heat
V,of my long walk. With inﬁnite trouble I
i ' managed to break into a public-house and get
f00d and drink. I was weary after eating,
«and went into the parlour behind the bar,
3 and slept on a black horsehair sofa I found
"C there i r
,, .I awoke to ﬁnd that dismal howling still in
my. ears, ‘Ullai ulla, ulla, ulla.’ It was now
fgydpsk, and after I had routed out some biscuits
sand a cheese in the bar——there was a meat-
safe, but it contained nothing but maggots—v-I

squares to Baker Street—Portman Square is

of disease/have taken toll of humanity since
the. beginning of things—taken toll of our pre-
‘ man ancestors since life began here. But by
Virtue of this natural selection of our kind we

those othertwo Martians that I had seen over-
aight, just as death had overtaken them. The
one had died, even as it had been crying to its
companions; perhaps it was the last to die, and
I its vbice had gone on perpetually until the force

All about the pit, and saved as by a miracle

TH’E EPILOGUE.

Z I CANNOT but regret, now that I am concluding I L I
'my'story, how little I am able to contribute to
the discussion of the many debatable questions‘ ,y
Which are still unsettled. In one respect I

1 shall certainly provoke criticism. My particular
province is‘speculative philosophy. My know-

1 ledge of comparative physiology is conﬁned to
a book or two, but it seems to me that Carver’s
suggestions as to the reason of the rapid death
of the Martians is so probable as to be regarded
almost as a proven conclusion. I have assumed
that‘in the bodyof my narrative. ,

,At any rate, in all the bodies of the Martians

' at were examined after the war, no bacteria
except those already known as terrestrial species
were found. , That they did not bury any of '
eir dead, and the reckless slaughter they per. ‘
petrated, point also to an entire ignorance of ‘
the‘putrefactive process, But probable as this 
Seaman is by no means a proVen conclusion; 7

The Epilogue ‘  - 299;
A question of graver and universal interestis
the possibility of another attack from the Mar-
Ixans. , I do not think that nearly enough atten-
ion being given to this aspect of the matter. ‘
Atg‘present the planet Mars is in conjunction,
but with every return to opposition I, for one,
anticipate a renewal of their adventure. In
any case, we should be prepared. It seems to
merthat it should be possible to deﬁne the
position of the gun from which the shots are
I scharged, to keep a sustained watch upon this
part of the planet, and to anticipate the arrival
of the néxt attack.

In that case the cylinder might be destroyed
with dynamite or artillery before it was sufﬁ—
ciently cool for the Martians to emerge, or
they might be butchered by means of guns so
oon' as the screw opened. It seems to me
hat-they have lost a vast advantage in the "
failure of their ﬁrst surprise. Possibly they
see it in the same light.

'Lessing had advanced excellent reasons for
pposing that the Martians have actually suc-
eeded in effecting a. landing on the planet
Venus; 'Seven months ago now, Venus and I
ats were in alignment with the sun ; that is to

the thing is impossible for men, and when the r

 be not onlya serious contribution to social history, but a treasury

‘He deals with its renaissance in the age of chivalry,
