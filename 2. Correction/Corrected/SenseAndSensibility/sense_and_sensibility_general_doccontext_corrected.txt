he family of dnshwood had been long settled in sussex 
their estate was large and their residence was at nursling park in the centre of their property where for many generations they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance 
the ate owner of this estate was a single man who lived to a very advanced age and who for many years of his life had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister 
but her death which happened ten years before his own produced a great alteration in his home 
for to supply her loss he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew mr henry wood the legal interior of the lowland estate and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it 
in the society of his nephew and niece and their children the old gentleman days were comfortably spent 
his attachment to them all increased 
the constant attention of mr and mrs hey dashwoorl to his wishes which proceeded not merely from interest but from goodness of heart gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive 
and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence 
i 
a i sense and sensibility 
by a former marriage mr henry dashed had one son 
3 his present lady three daughters 
the son a steam y blue young man was amply provided for by the one of his mother which had been large and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age 
by his own mania e likewise which hasp soon afterwards he and to his wealth 
to him therefore the succession to the lowland estate was not so really important as to his sisters 
for their fortune independent of what might arise to them from their fathers inhabiting that property could be but small 
their mother had nothing and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal 
for the remaining moiety of his first wife fortune was also secured to her child and he had only a life interest in it 
the old gentleman died 
his will was read and like almost every-lather will gave as much disappointed as pure 
e was neither so unjust nor so ungrateful as to leave his estate from his nephew 
but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest 
mr dashed had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son 
but 
to his son and his son s son a child of four ears old it was secured in such a way as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him and who most needed a provision any charge on the estate or by any leg of its vast unable woods 
the whole was tied up for the benefit of this child who in occasional visits with his father and mother at normandy had so far gained on the affections of his uncle by such attractions as are by no was unusual in children of two or three years old an imperfect articulation an earnest desire of having his own way many cunning tricks and a great deal of noise as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which for years he had received from his niece and her daughters 
send 
and sensibility 
3 he meant not to be unkind however and as a mark of his affection for the three girls he left them a thousand pounds a-piece 
mr dashwood’s dial ointment was at first severe 
but his temper was cheer mul and sanguine and he might reasonably hope to live many yearn and by living economical lay by 31 considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large and capable of almost immediate improvement 
but the fortune which had been so hardly in coming was his only one twelvemonth 
he survived his uncle no longer 
and ten thousand pounds including the late elegancies was all that remained for his widow and daughter his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known and to him mr dashed recommended with all the strength and urgency which illness could come mad the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters 
mr john dnshwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family 
but he was affected by a rest commendation of such a nature at such s time and he promised to do everything in his power to make them comfortable 
his father was rendered easy by such an assurance 
and mr john dnshwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them 
he was not an indisposed young man unless to be rather coli-heaned and rather llellllllll is to be ill seed ut he was in em we respected 
for lreﬁnducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties 
had he married a more amiable woman he might have been made still more respectable than he was 
he might even have been made amiable himself 
for he was very young when he married and very fond of his wife 
but mrs john dashed was a silken caricature of himself 
more narrow-minded and self sh 
4 sense and sensibility 
when he gave his promise to his father he hesitated within himself to increase the fortunes of his letters by the present of a thousand pounds apiece 
he then a really thought himself equal to it 
e pmsycct of four thousand years in addition to his present income besides the remaining half of his own mother fortune warmed his heart and made him feel ca hive of generosity 
yes he would give them three pound pounds it would be liberal and handsome 
it would be enough to make them completely ear 
three thousand pounds 
he could re so candid cable a sum with little inconvenience e thought of it all day long and for many days successive and he did not repent 
no sooner was his father's funeral over than my john dead-wood without sending an notice of her intention to her mother-in-law arrived with her child and their attendants 
no one could dispute her right to come 
the house was her husband from the moment of his father's decease 
but the delicacy of her conduct was so much the greater and to a woman in mrs dashwood’s situation with only common feeling must have been highly unpleasing 
but in her mind there was a sense of honour to keen a generosity so romantic that any offence of the kind by whomsoever given or received was to her a source of immovable disgust 
mrs john dashed had never been a flavour in with any of her husband's family but she had had no opportunity till the present of showing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it 
so acutely did mrs dashed feel this ungraciously behaviour and so earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it that on the arrival of the latter she would have quitted the house for ever had not the entirely of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going and her own tender love for sense and sensibility 
s all her three children determined her afterwards to stay and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother 
linton this eldest daughter whose advice was so effectual possessed a strength of understanding and coolness of judgment which quelled her though only nineteen to be the counsellor of her mother and enabled her frequently to counteract to the advantage of them all that eagerness of mind in mrs dashed which must generally have led to imprudence 
she had an excellent heart 
her disposition was affectionate and her feelings were strong but she knew how to over them it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be 
taught 
a avenues liviers were in man respects unite equal to elinor’s 
she was sensibly and clever 
but eager in everything 
her sorrows her joy i could have no moderation 
she was generous amiable e interesting she was everything but prudent 
the resemblance between her and her mother was striking great 
linton saw with concern the excess of her sister's sensibility 
but by mrs dashed it was valued and cherished 
they encouraged each other now in the violence of their affection 
the agony of grief which overpowered them at first was voluntarily renewed wan sought for was created again and again 
they gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future 
linton too was deeply affected 
but still she could struggle she could oxen herself 
she could consult with her brother could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival and treat her with proper mention and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion and encourage her to similar forbearance 
s sense and sensibility 
margaret the other sister was a good-humoured well-disposed 
d 3 but as she had already imbibed a good deal of an'anne’s romance without having much of her sense 
the did not at thirteen bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life 
both 3 
is john dashed now installed herself mistress of holland 
and her mother and sister-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors 
as such however they were treated by her with quiet civility 
and by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself his wife and their child 
he really pressed them with some eagerness to consider normandy as their home 
and as no plan appeared so eligible to my dashed as remaining there till she could accommodate heroelfwith a house in the neighbourhood his invitation was accepted 
a continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight was exactly what suit her mind 
in season of cheerfulness no temper could be more cheerful than hers or 30 in a greater degree that sanguine expectation o happiness which is his itself 
but in narrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy 
mrs john dashed did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters 
to take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be inqmvcrishing him to the most dreadful degree 
she begged him to think again on the subject 
how could he answer it to himself to rob his child and his only child too of so large a sum 
sense and sensibility 
7 and what possible claim could the main dead-wood who were related to him only by half blood which the considered an no relationship at all have on hi generously to to large an amount 
it war very well known that no affection war ever in to exist between the children of any man by i rent marriages 
and why was he to ruin himself and their poor little hurry by giving away all his money to his half-rotten 
it was my father last request to me replied her husband that i should austin his widow and daughter 3 he did not know what he was talking of i dare to 3 ten to one but he wan lighthearted at the time 
he been in his right senses he could not leave thought of such a thing in begging on to give away half our fortune from ur own chil 
a e did not tip ate for any particular urn my dear fanny 
he only requested me in general terror to admit them and make their situation more uncomfortable than it was in his power to do 
perhaps it would have been at well if he had left it wholly to myself 
he could hardly suppose i should neglect them 
but an he required the promise i could not do lea than give it at least i thought so at bedtime 
the promise therefore was given and must be something must be done for them whenever they leave ireland and settle in a new home well then it 
something be done for them 
but rim 
something need not be three thousand consider 4 the added 2 that when the money ll once parted with it never can return 
your listen will marry and it will be gone for ever 
if indeed it could ever be restored to our poor little in 
2 why to be mire raised her husband very gravely 2 that would make a neat difference 
the time may come when varry will regret that in large a turn was 85 sense and sensibility 
parted with 
if he should have a numerous family for instance it would be a very convenient addition c to be lure it would a perhaps then it would be bear for all parted the sum were diminished one half 
five hundred would be a prodigious increased to their fortune 
oh beyond an thing great 
what brother on earth would do hill 
of much for him listen even if really his sisters 
and as it it 
only hdfbloodl but on have such a generous spirit l b c would not with to do anything mean he replied a one had rather on inch occasions do too much than too little 
no one at least can think i have not done enough for them even themselves they can hardly expect more there is no knowing what they may expect a laid the lady but we are not to think of their expectation the relation in what you can afford to do a fairly and i think i may afford to give them over hundred pounds a 
piece 
ai it in without any addition of mine they will each have above three thousand pounds on their mother's death a very comfortable fortune for any young woman c to be lure it it and indeed it strikes me that they can want no addition at all 
they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them 
if they marry they will he sure of doing well 
and if they not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest often thousand pounds 
2 that is very true and therefore i do not know whether upon the whole it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while the lives rather than for them 
something of the antiquity kind i mean 
my sisters would feel the good choice of it on well as herself 
a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable sense and sensibility 
9 his wife hesitated a little however in giving her consent to this plan 
to be sure a said she it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once 
but then if mrs touchwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in a fifteen years 
my dear fanny 
her life can not be worth half that purchase certainly not 
but if you observe pale always live for ever when there is any anxiety w them 
and the in very stout and healthy and hardly forty 
an anxiety i. a very serious business 
it comes over and over every year and there is no getting rid of it 
you are not aware of what you are doing 
l have known a great deal of the trouble of anxieties 
for my mother wan clogged with the payment of three to old supemnnuated servant by my either s will and it is hung how disagreeable the found it 
twice every year these inquiries were to he paid 
and then then was the trouble of getting it to them 
and then one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing 
my mother was unite sick of it 
her income was not her own she said with such perpetual claims on it 
and it worth more unburned in my er because otherwise the money would have been entirely it in others disposal without any destruction whatever 
t hat given me such an abhorrence of anxieties that i am sure i would not in myself down to the payment of one for all the world a it is certainly an unpleasant thing replied mr dashed c to have those kind of yearly drains on one income 
one fortune as your mother justly says is no 
one own 
to be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum on every rent day 
is by no mean desirable it takes away once independence undoubtedly 
and after all you have no thanks to sense and sensibility 
for it 
they think themselves tenure you do no more than what it expected and it mines no gratitude at all 
if i were you whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely 
i would not bind myself to allow them anything yearly 
it may be very inconvenience some years to apart a hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expense i believe you are right my love 
it will be better that there should be no ingenuity in the cane 
whatever i may give them occasionally will be of far greater distance than a yearly allowance because they would only enlarge their water of living if they felt lure of a larger income and would not 
be expense the richer for it at the end of the year 
it will certainly be much the best way 
a pretext of fifty pounds now and then will prevent their ever being directed for money and will lap think he amply discharging my promise to my father to be sure it will 
indeed to by the truth i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all 
the since he thought of i dare say was only such as might be reasonably expected of you 
for instance such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them helping them to move their things and lending them present of cash and game and so forth whenever they are in season 
i ll la my life that he meant nothing further 
indeed it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did 
do but conrirlcr my dear mr dashed how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings them in fifty pounds amir a-piece and of come they will pay their mother for their board out of it 
altogether they will have live hundred mayor amongst them and what on earth can sense and sensibmjtv 
i four women want for more than that 
they will live so cheap 
their housekeeping will be nothing at all 
they will have no carriage no horses and hardly any servants 
they will keep no company and can have no expenses of any kind 
only conceive how comfortable they will be 
five hundred years 
i am sure i can not imagine how they will spend half of it 
and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it 
they will be much more able to give you something upon m word said mr dashed 
i believe you are per costly right 
my either certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you an 
i clearly understand it now and i will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described 
when in mother removes into another house my services sh be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can 
some little present of furniture 
too may be acceptable then 
certainly returned mrs john touchwood 
a but however one thing must be considered 
when your father and mother moved to holland though the furniture of still was sold all the china plate and linen was saved and is now left to your mother 
her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it that is a material consideration undoubtedly 
a valuable legally indeed 
and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here eyes 
and the net of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house 
a got deal too handsome in my opinion for any place leg can ever afford to live in 
but however so it is 
your father thought only of then 
and i must my this that 120 sense and sensibility 
you owe no particular gratitude to him nor attention to hit whither 
or we very well know that if he could he would have left ill everything in the world to 152m.” this argument was irresistible 
it gave to his intense 
tom whatever of decision we wanting before 
and he finally resolved that it would be absolutely momentary if not highly indecorous to do more for the widow and children of his father than such kind of neighbour acts at his own wife pointed out 
throm333 
is dashed remained at normandy several months 
not from any disinclination to mine when the sight of every well-known pot offered to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while 
for when her spirits began to revive and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of lightning its affections by melancholy remembrance she was impatient to be gone and in efetigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of holland 
for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible 
but the could hear of no iteration that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease and suited the presence of her eldest daughter whose steadied judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income which her mother would have approved 
mrs touchwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour which gave comfort to his lost 13th reflection 
she doubted the sincerity of this maniac no more than he had doubted it himself and the thought of it for her daughters make with connection though sense and sensibility 
3 as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than seven thousand pounds would support her in affluence 
for their brother sake too for the sake of his own heart she rejoiced 
and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before in believing him incapable of generosity 
his attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their weena was dear to him and for a long time she warmly relied on the liberality of his intentions 
the contempt which she had very early in their acquaintance felt for her daughter-in-law was very much increased by the further knowledge of her character which half-a-yenr’s residence in her family afforded 
and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater reliability according to the opinions of mrs dashwoo‘d to her daughters continuance at normandy 
this circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of mrs john hood a gentleman-like and pleasing young man who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sisters establishment at ireland and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there 
some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest for edward fawn was the eldest son of a man who had died very rich 
and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence door except a train sum the whole of his fortune depended on the will n his mother 
but mrs dashed was alike uninlluenccd by either consideration 
it was enough for her that he a dared to be amiable that he loved her daughter an that linton returned the partiality 
it was contrary to every doctrine of hen 4 sense aid shsybhjtv 
that difference of fortune should keep couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of a tin 
and that elinor‘s merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her was to her company in he 
toward terror was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address 
he was not handsome and his manners required intimacy to make then pleasing 
he was too diligent to do justice to himself 
but when his natural shyness was overcome his behaviour gave every indication of an open affectionate heart 
his understanding was good and his education had given it solid improvement 
but he was neither petted by facilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister who longed to see him distinguished 
as 
they hardly knew what 
they wanted him to make a one figure in the world in some manner or other 
his mother wished to interest him in political concerns to get him into parliament or to ace him connected with some of the great men of the day 
mrs john dead-wood wished it likewise 
hut in the meanwhile till one of these superior blessings could be obtained it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a brooch 
but edward had no turn for great men or branches 
all his wishes centred in domestic comfort and the quiet of private life 
fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising 
edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of mrs dashed s attention 
for she was at that time in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects 
she saw only that he was quiet and unobtrusive and she liked him for it 
he did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-trimmed conversation 
she was first called to observe and approve him further by a reflection which linton sense and sensibility 
150 chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister 
it was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother 
it is enough said she 
to say that he is unlike fanny is enough 
it implies everything amiable 
i love him already 
i think you will like him a said linton 2 when you know more of him 
like him 
a replied her mother with a smile 
d i can feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love 
b you may esteem him a i have never yet known what it 
was to separate esteem and love 
mrs dashed now took pains to get acquainted with him 
her manners were teachings and soon banished his'reserve 
she speedily comprehended all his merits 
the persuasion of his regard for linton perhaps assisted her penetration 
but she really felt assured of his worth and even that witness of manner which irritated against all her established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affectionate 
no sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to linton than she considered their serious attachment as certain and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching 
a in a few months my dear marian d said she a linton will in all probability be settled for life 
we shall miss her 
but 1100 will be happy e s mamma 
how shall we do without her 
a 
my love it will be scarcely 31 separation 
we shall live within a few miles of each other and shall meet every day of our lives 
you will gain a brother 
n real affectionate brother 
i have the highest opinion in the world of edward hurt 
but you ll sense and sensibility 
look grave marian 
do you disapprove your sister choice 
a perhaps a said marian d i ma consider it with some surprise 
edward is very amiable and i love him tenderly 
but yet he is not the kind of young man 
there is a something wanting his figure is not striking 
it has none of that grace which i should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister 
his eyes want all that spirit that tree which at once announce virtue and intelligence 
and besides all this i am afraid mamma he has no real taste 
music seems scarcely to attract him and though he desires elinor’s drawings very much it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth 
it is evident in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws that in fact he knows nothing of the matter 
he desires as a lover not as a connoisseur 
to satisfy me those characters must be united 
i could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every net coincide with my own 
he must enter into all my feelings 
the same books the same music mun charm us both 
of muhammad how spiritless how tame was towards manner in reading to us last 
night 
i felt for my sister most severely 
yet she bore it with so much composure she seemed scarcely to notice it 
i could hardly keep my seat 
to hear those beauties lines which have frequently almost driven me wild pronounced with such impenetrable calmness such dreadful indifference 
he would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose 
i thought so at the time 
but you would give him copper 
nay mamma if he is not to be animated by copper l 
but we must allow for difference of taste 
linton has not my feelings and therefore she may overlook it and be happy with him 
but it would have ﬂaw/ﬂimsy sense and sensibility 
l broken m heart had i loved him to hear him read with no little mailaility 
rama the more i know of the world the more am i convinced that i shall never lee a man whom i can really love 
i require is much 
he must have all edward s rule and hi potent and manners must ornament hire goodness with every possible charming a remember my love that you are not seventeen 
it in yet too early in life to despair of such an happiness 
why should you be i 
fortunate than your mother 
in one circumstance only my marriage may your destiny bediil‘crcnt from here 
a better 3 
a hat a pity it in linton aid marian 
that edward should have no note for drawing 
no taste for drawing 
replied elixir 
why should ou think so 
e does not new kind indeed t he has great pleasure in seeing the performance of other people and i assure you he in by no means deficient in natural taste though he in not had opportunities of improving it 
had he ever been in the way of learning think he would have drawn very well 
he disarm him own jug t in such matters to much that he in away until in to give his opinion on any picture 
but he ha an innate and simplicity of taste which in general direct him perfectly right marian was afraid of attending and laid no more on the subject 
but the kind of approbation which linton described an excited in him by the drawing e of other people was very far from that natural delight i. uz 18 sense and sensibility 
which in her opinion could alone be called taste 
yet though smiling within herself at the mistake the honoured her sister for that blind partiality to edward which produced it 
d i hope marian d continued elixir 2 on do not consider him is deficient in general taste 
indeed i think i may say that ou can not for your behaviour to him is perfectly cord and infirm 
were your opinion i am sure you could never be civil to him marian hardly knew what to my 
she would not wound the feelings of her sister on any account and at to say what she did not believe me impossible 
at length she re lied 
do not offended elixir if my praise of him it not in everything equal to your sense of his merits 
i have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minute propensities of his mind his inclination and tastes as you have 
but i have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense 
i think him everything that is worthy and amiable d i am sure replied linton with a smile that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with inch come emendations as that 
i do not perceive how you could ax rest yourself more warmly glinrianne was rejoiced to and her sister so easily pleased 
of his sense and his goodness d continued elixir d no one can i think be in doubt who has seen him often enough h to engage him in unreserved conversation 
the excellence of his understanding and his prince is can be concealed only by that shyness which too often kick him silent 
you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth 
but of his manner propensities as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself 
he and i have been at times thrown a good deal together while sense and sensible 
19 you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother 
i have seen a run deal of him have studied his sentiments and his opinion on subjects of literature and taste 
and upon the whole i venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed his enjoyment of books exceedingly great his imagination lively his observation just and correct and his taste delicate and pure 
his abilin'es in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person 
at first sight his address is certainly not striking 
and his person can hardly be called handsome till the expression of his eyes which are uncommonly good and the general sweetness of his countenance is perceived 
at present i know him so well that i think him really handsome 
or at least almost so 
what my you marian 
a d i shall we soon think him handsome elixir if i do not now 
hen you tell me to love him as a brother i shall no more see perfection in his face than i now do in his heart elixir started at this declaration and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into in speaking of him 
she felt that edward stood very high in her opinion 
she believed the regard to be mutual 
but she required greater certainty of it to make marian's conviction of their attachment agreeable to her 
she knew that what marian and her mother conjectured one moment they believed the next 
that with them to wish was to hope and to hope was to expect 
she tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister 
d i do not attempt to deny d said she 2 that i think very highly of him 
that i greatly esteem that i like him marian here burst forth with indignation 
yes him 
like him 
good-hearted elixir 
2 sense and sensibility 
oh 
one than cold-hemedl ashamed of being otherwise 
are the world again and will lave the room this moment 
linton could not help laughing 
excuse ice laid her and be allured that l mantnooﬁ'ume to ou latin into uietawa.ofm ownfeell'ngl 
ill-lit them tube stronger than have clams 
believe them in short robe lunch a hive merit and the suspicion 
the hope of hit affection for me my warrant without impudence or folly 
but further than thin on must not believe 
i am by no mean 
assured of heu regard for me 
there are moments when the extent of it means doubtful 
and till his sentiments use fully known you not wonder at my writhing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality b c or calling it more than it is 
in my heart myself little 
scarce y any doubt of his preference 
but there are other point 
to be convinced maiden he inclination 
he ll very far from being independent 
what his mother really ll we can not know 
but from fanny occasional mention of her conduct and onion we have never been dispersed to think her amiable 
and i in 
very much mistaken if edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way if he were to with to marry a woman who had not either a gun 
fortune or high rank 
marian wan astonished to and how much the imagination of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth 
and you really are not engaged to him 
a said she 
yet it certainly soon will happen 
but two advantage will proceed from thin delay 
i shall not low you in won and edward will have greater opal community of improving that natural mute for your lavauriu pursuits which must be of indiapennbly necessary to your future felicity 
oh 
if he should sense and sensibility 
a 
be so far emulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself how delightful it would be 
a linton had given her real opinion to her sister 
she could not consider her partiality for edward in so prosperous a state as marian had believed it 
there was at times a want of spirit 
about him which if it did not denote indifference spoke a something almost as unpromising 
a doubt of her regard supposing him to feel it need not give him more than inquietude 
it would not be likely to produce that direction of mind which frequent 
attended him 
a more reasonable cause might be und in the de dant situation which formed the indulgence of his i action 
she knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself without strictly attending to her views for his i enticement 
with such a knowledge as this it was impossible for linton to feel easy on the subject 
she was far from depending on that result of his preference of her which her mother and sister still considered as certain 
nay the longer they were together the male doubtful seemed the nature of his regard 
and sometimes for a few painful minutes she believed it to be no more than fnendvhi 
illo whatever might really be its limits it was enough when perceived by his sister to make her uneasy 
and it the same time which was still more common to make her uncivil 
she took the rest opportunity of aﬂ'ronting her mother-in-law on the occasion talking to her so expressive of her brothers glut expectation of mrs ferrars’s resolution that both her sons should marry well and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to draw pin in that mrs sherwood could neither pretend to he unconscious nor endeavour to be calm 
she gave her an owner which 120 sense and sensibility 
marked her contempt and instantly left the room 
resolving that whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a retrieval her beloved linton should not be exposed another week to such insinuationsin this state of her spirit a letter was delivered to her from the post which contained a proposal particularly well-formed 
it was the offer of a small house on very easy terms belonging to a relation of her own a gentleman of consequence and property in devonshire 
the letter was from this gentleman himself and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation 
he understood that she was in need of a dwelling and though the house he now altered her was merely a cottage he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary if the situation pleased her 
he earnestly pressed her after giving the particulars of the house and garden to come with her daughters to barton park the lace of his own residence from whence the might judge herself whether barton cottage for the houses were in the some parlour could by any alteration be made comfortable to her 
he seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style at could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin 
more especially at a moment when she was milking under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connection 
she needed no time for delibcmtinn or inquiry 
her n solution was formed as she read 
the situation of barton in a county so far distant from sussex n devonshire which but a few hours before would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every blue advantage belonging to the place war now its met commendation 
to it the neighbourhood of holland was no longer an evil 
it was an object of desire 
it was a blessing in comparison of the misery of continuing sense and sensibility her daughter 
less guest and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress 
she instant wrote sir john middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness and her acceptance of his proposal 
and then hastened to nhowhoth letters to her daughters that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent liquor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from normandy than immediately amongst their present acquaintance 
on box 
head therefore it was not for her to oppose her mother s intention of removing into devonshire 
the house too as described by sir john was on so simple a scale and the rent so uncommonly moderate as to leave her no right of objection on either point 
and therefore though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy though it was a removal from the vicinity of holland beyond her wishes she made no attempt to delude her mother from sending her letter of acquiescence 
thank 17 
o sooner was her answer despatched than mrs dashed indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house and should incommoded them no longer than till everything were read for her inhabiting it 
they heard her with s pride 
like john dashed said nothing 
but her husband civilly that she would not be settled far from normandy 
he had great satisfaction in reply in that she was going into devonshire 
edward turned hastily towards heron hearing this and in a voice of surprise and concern which 249 sense and sensibility 
required no explanation to her repeated a devounhilel are you indeed going there 
so far from hence 
and to what part 
of it a she explained the station 
it was within four mile 
northward of exerted 
a it ll but a cottage 4 the continued but i hope to thee many of my friend in it 
a room or two can easily be added 
and if to friend and no difficulty in travelling so far to see me am sure i will and none in accommodate them 
she concluded with a very kind invitation to mr and my john dead-wood to visit her at barton 
and to edward the gave one with still greater affection 
though her late conversation with her day father-in-law had made her resolve on remaining at ireland no longer than wan unavoidable it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended 
to separate edward and linton was far from being her object as ever 
and like wished to thaw mus john dead-wood dull pointed invitation to her brother how totally the regarded her disapprove

mr john dead-wood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that the had taken an hour at web i distance from normandy as to prevent hit being of an service to her in removing her furniture 
he really fee t conscientious vexed on the occasion 
for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by thin arrangement rendered impracticable 
— the furniture wan all lent round by water 
it chiefly consisted of household linen plate china and books with an handsome forte of marianne’t 
mr john dashed saw the package depart with a sigh 
the could not he 
facing it hard that an 1100 daphwood'a income would be do tingling in comparison with their own the should have any handsome article of furniture 
sense and sensibility 
25 mrs touchwood took the house for a twelvemonth 
it was ready furnished and she might have immediate possession 
no difficulty arose on either side in the agreement 
and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at ireland and to determine her future household before she set all for the west 
and this as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her was soon done 
— the horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his duty and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter 
for the comer fort of her children had she consulted only her own wishes she would have kept it 
but the discretion of liquor prevailed 
her wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three 
two maids and a man with whom th were speedily divided from amongst those who scanned their estate banishment st normandy 
the man and one of the maids were sent of immediately into devonshire to prepare the house for their distress arrival 
for as lady middleton was entirely unknown to mrs dashed she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at barton park 
and she relied so doubtingly on sir johns describe 
scion of the house as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own 
her a eagerness to be gone from normandy was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the roof act of her removal 
a satisfaction which was but lee y attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure 
now was the time when her son-in-law’s promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled 
since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishing but mrs dashed began 26 suds and sensibility

his countenance was thoroughly good-humoured 
and his manners were a friend as the style of his letter 
their arrival seemed to a word him real satisfaction and their comfort to be an object of real solicitude to him 
he said much of his meet desire of their living on the most sociable terms with his family 
and refused them so cordially to dine at barton park every y till they were better settled at home that though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility they could not give offence 
his kindness was not confined to words 
for within an hour after he left them a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game 
he insisted moreover on conveying all their letters to and from the t for them and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day

hareton park was about half a mile from the cottage 
the ladies had passed near it on their way along the valley but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of m hill 
the house was large and handsome 
and the middleton lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance 
the former was for sir johns gratification the latter for that of his lady 
they were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood 
it was necessary to the happiness of both 
for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined ther employments unconnected with such as society produced within a very narrow compass 
sir john was a swordsman lady middleton a mother 
he hunted and shot and she humoured her children 
and these were their only resources 
lady middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round while sir johns independent employments were in existence only half the time 
continual engage events at home and abroad however supplied all the decencies of nature and education 
supported the good spirits of sir john and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife 
lady middleton inquired herself upon the elegance of her table and of all her domestic amusement 
and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties 
but sir johns satisfaction in society was much more real 
he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold and the noise they were the better was he 31 sense and sinsibili'i'v 
pleased 
he was a blessing so all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood for in summer he was for ever forming parties to out cold ham and chicken out of doors and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not muttering under the insatiable appetite of fifteen 
the arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitant 
he had now procured for his cottage at barton 
the miss daubwoods were young 
pretty and unexpected 
it was enough to secure his good of iron for to be unaltered was all that a pretty girl you d want to make her mind as cultivating as her person 
the friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodation tole whose situation might be considered in comparison with the past an unfortunate 
in showing kindness to his cousins therefore 
he had the real satisfaction of a good heart 
and in settling a family of females only in his cottage he had all the satisfaction of a swordsman 
for a swordsman though he esteem on 
those of his sex who are sports likewise is not o co desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor 
mrs dashed and her daughters were met at the door of the house by sir john who welcomed them to barton park with unabated sincerity 
and as he attended them to the drawing-room repented to the young ladies the concern which the am subject had drawn from him the day before at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them 
they would lee he said only one gentleman there besides himself 
a particular friend who was staying at the park but who was neither very young nor very gay 
he hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party and could assure them it should never happen so again 
he had sense and sensibility 
31 been to several families that morning in of procure some addition to their number 
t it was moon might and eve body wan full of engagements 
luckily lady i demons mother had arrived at barton within the last hour and as she we a very cheerful agreeable woman he hoped the young ladies would not and it so very dull as they might imagine 
the young ladies as well as their mother were perfectly y satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party and wished for no more 
mrs penning lady middleton mother was a good-humoured merry fat elderly woman who talked a great deal seemed very happy and rather vulgar 
she was full of jokes and laughter and before dinner was over had said many withy thing the subject of lovers and husbands 
hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in sussex and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not 
marian was vexed at it for her sisters sake and turned her eyes towards linton to see how she bore these attacks with an earnestness which gave elixir far more pain than could arise from such commonplace milker at mrs jennings’s 
colonel grandson the friend of sir john seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend than lady middleton was to be his wife or men penning to be lady middleton mother 
he was silent and grave 
his 2 france however was not unpleasing in spite of lull being in the opinion of marian and margaret an absolute old bachelor for he was on the wrong side of ﬁve-and-thirty 
but thou h his face was not handsome his countenance was noon e and his address was particularly gentlemanly 
there was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them a companions to the dashwoods 
but the cold insipid of lady middleton was so pard 
c 104 sense and sensibility 
particularly repulsive that in comparison of it the gravity of colonel brandy and even the boiaoemua north of sir john and hit mother-in-law was intending 
lady middleton seemed to be routed to enjoyment only by the enhance of her four noisy children after dinner who pulled her about tore her clothes and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves 
in the evening as marian was discovered to be musical she was invited to play 
the instrument was unlocked everybody prepared to be charmed and marian who can very well at their re neat went through the chief of the son i which lady middleton had brought into the family on her marriage and which perhaps had lain ever trace in the name poison on the pinafore 
for her lad ship had celebrated that event by giving up music though by her mother s account the had plea ed extremely well and by her own was very fond o it 
marian's performance was highly applauded 
sir john was loud in his admiration at the end of every son and as loud in his conversation with the other while every tone fatted 
lady middleton frequently called him to order wondered how any one attention could be diverted from music for a moment and naked marines to lift a particular song which marian had june ﬁnilhcd 
colonel grandson alone of all the party heard her without being in rapture 
he paid her on y the compliment of attention 
and the felt a magnet for him on the occupation which the other had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste 
his leisure in music though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own wan inestimable when contrasted against the horrible sensibility of the others 
and the was reasonable enough to allow that a man of ﬁve-and-thirty might well have lived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite suds and senstnrm'v 
3 power of enjoyment 
she perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel advanced state of life which humanity required 
than 17 
mrs penning wan a widow with an ample juncture 
she had only two daughters both of whom the had lived to ace respectably married and the had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world 
in the promotion of this object she wan jealously active as far an her ability reached and missed no opportunity of projecting wedding among all the young peor e of her acquaintance 
she was remarkably quick in discovery of attachment and had enjoyed the advantage of raining the bleached and the vanity of many a young lady by indications of her power over ouch a young man 
and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at barton decisively to pronounce that colonel branch was very much in love with minute dashed 
she rather suspected it to be no on the very first evening of their being together from his listening to attentively while she tang to them 
and when the visit wan returned by the middleton dining at the cottage the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again 
it mun 
be so 
she was perfectly convinced of it 
it would be an excellent match for b was rich and as wan handsome 
mrs penning had been anxious to see colonel grandson well married ever since her connection with sir john first brought him to her know

and she was always anxious to get a good husband r every pretty girl 
the immediate advantage to herself wan by no means 16a sense and smsrnru'rv 
inoonsidmble for it applied her with endless jokes against them both 
at the park she laughed at the colonel and in the cottage e at lausanne 
to the former her raillery was p badly as far as it only himself exactly indifferent 
but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible 
and when its object was understood the hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity or ensure its impertinence for the considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel advanced years and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor 
mrs dashed who could not think a man ever years younger than herself so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter ventured to clear mrs penning from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age 
a but at least comma you can not deny the absurdity of the accusation though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured 
colonel grandson is certainly younger than mrs penning but he is old enough to my father 
and if he were ever animated enough to be in love must have long outlive every sensation of the kind 
it is too ridiculous 
when is a man to be safe from such wit if age and infirmity will not protect him 3 “inﬁrmit l said linton 
do you call colonel brandy in run 
i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother 
but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs 
a did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism 
and in not that the commonest infirmity of declining life 2 
a my dearest child a said her mother laughing at thin rate you must be in continual terror of in decay 
and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty sense and sensibility 
3 comma you are not doing me justice 
i know very well that colonel grandson is not old enough to make his friends yet 
a retentive of losing him in the corner of nature 
e may live twenty years longer 
but thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony 
perhaps said linton 
thirtyfive and seventeen had better not have anything to do with matrimony together 
but if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is in lie at seven-and-twenty i should not think colonel random being thirty-five any objection to his marrying her 
a woman of seven-and-twenty d said marian after pausing a moment can never hope to feel or inquire affection again 
and if her home be uncommon able or her fortune small i can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse for the sake of the provision and security of a wife 
in his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable 
it would be a compact of convenience and the world would be satisfied 
in my eyes it would be no marriage at all but that would be nothing 
to me it would seem only a commercial exchange in which each wished to be elated at the expense of the other it would be impossible i know a replied linton to convince you that a woman of seven-and 
twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough to love to make him a desirable come on to her 
but i much object to your coming co one brandy and his wife to the constant confinement of a nick chamber merely because he chanced to complain yesterday a very cold damp day of a alight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders

with aches cramp rheumatism and eve of ailment that can alice the old and the f ee i d had he been only in a violent fever in would not have despised him half so much

we have now been here almost a fortnight 
and yet he does not come 
nothing but real india lion could occasion this extraordinary delay 
hat else can detain him at normandy d had you any idea of his coming so soon 
said mr dashed 
i had none 
on the contrary if i have felt any anxiety at all on the subject 
it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation when i talked of his coming to barton 
does linton expect him already 10 
i have never mentioned it to her 
but of wane she must

what can be the meaning of it 
but the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable

he dashwoods were now settled at barton with tolerable comfort to themselves 
the house and the garden with all the objects surrounding them were now become familiar 
and the ordinary pure suits which had given to scotland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than normandy had been able to afford since the loss of their father 
sir john middleton who called on them every day for the rest fortnight and who was not in the habit of seeing much occur actions at home could not conceal his amazement on making them always employed 
their visitors except those from barton ark were not many 
for in spite of sir john s up t entreaties that they would mix more in the being hood and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service the independent of mrs dashwood’s spirit overcame the wish of society for her children 
and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of n walk 
there were but few who could be so classes 
and it was not all of them that were actionable 
about a mile and a half from the cottage along the narrow winding valley of allen which issued from that of barton as formerly described the giddy in one of their earliest walks discovered an ancient 40 sense and swsmru'n 
respectable-looking mansion 
which by reminding them a little of holland interested their inclination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it 
but they learnt on in diary that in possessor an elderly lady of very g character was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world and never mind from home 
the whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks 
the high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to smelt the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits were a happy alternate when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties 
and towards one of these hills did marian and margaret one memorable morning direct their steps attracted by the partial sunshine of a shower sky and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned 
the weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book in spite of marian s declaration that the day would be wasting fair and that every threatening cloud would be drawn of 
from their hills 
and the two girls set all together 
they gain ascended the down rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky and when they caught in their faces the animating gale of a high south-westerly wind they pitied the fear which had prevented their mother and linton from sharing such delightful sensations 
2 is there a felicitous in the world said marian superior to this 
margaret we will walk here at least two hours margaret agreed 
and they pursued their way against the wind missing it with laughing delight or about twenty minutes longer when suddenly the clouds united over their heads and a driving rain set full in their faces

421 chagrined and so raised they were obliged though unwillingly to turn cake for no shelter was nearer than their own house 
one consolation however remained for them to which the existence of the moment gave more than usual propriety 
it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate 
they set off 
marian had at first the advantage but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground and margaret unable to stop herself to assist her was involuntarily hurried along and reached the bottom in san 
gentleman carrying a gun with two pointers playing round him was passing up the hill and within a few yards of marian when her accident happened 
he put down his un and ran to her assistance 
she had raised herself worn the ground but her foot had been twisted in the fall and she was scarcely able to stand 
the gentleman offered his services and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necks 
mary took her up in his arms without farther delay and carried her down the hill 
then passing through the garden the gate of which had been left open by margaret he bore her directly into the house whither margaret as just arrived and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour 
linton and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance and while the eyes of th were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprang from his appearance he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person which was uncommonly handsome received additional charms from his voice and expression

the honour wan readily granted 
and he then departed to make himself still more interesting 
in the midst of an heavy rain 
hit manly beauty and 
more than common graceful were instantly the theme of general admiration and the laugh which his gallantry mailed against marian received particular spirit from his exterior attraction marian herself had seen lens of hit pen than the rest for the confusion which crimson over her face on his lifting her up had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house 
but the had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others and with an energy which always adorned her praise 
hit person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite ivory 
and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality there was a rapidity of thou hat which particularly recommended the action to her

sir john called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of sense and sensibility

and marianne’a accident being related to him he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of willoughby at allen 
“willoughbyl

i do not know much about him as to all bah but he is a pleasant good-humoured fellow and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer i ever saw

but marian could no more satisfy him as to the colour of mr willoughby’s later than he could describe to her the shades of is mind 
but who is he 
a said linton 
a where does he come from 
has he a house at allen 
a on this point sir john could give more certain intelligence 
and he told them that mr willoughby had no property of his own in the country 
that he resided there only while he was visited the old lady at allen court to whom he was faded and whose stones he was to inherit

i lee how it will be 
you will be getting your cap at him now and never think of poor grandson that is an expression sir john d said marian warmly 2 which i particularly dislike

you have already ascertained mr ploughboy s opinion in almost

you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic 
another meeting will suffer to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty and second running and then you can have nothing farther to ask 
d a minor a cried marian 2 is this fair 
is this just 
are my ideas so scanty 
but i see what you mean 
i have been too much at my ease too ha by too frank 
i have erred against every common ace notion of decorum 
i have been open and sincere where i on hit to have been reserved spiritless dull and deceit 
had i milked only of the weather and the roads and had i spoken only once in ten minutes this reproach would have been spared my love a said her mother you must not be offended with linton 
aha was only in i should scold her myself if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friends marian was softened in a moment 
willoughlry on his side gave every roof of his leisure in their acquaintance which an evil end which of improving it could offer 
he came to them every day 
to inquire after marian was at first his excuse 
but the encouragement of his reception to which every day gave greater kindness made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible by marian's perfect recovery 
she was confined for some days to the house but never had any confinement been less irksome 
willoughby was a young man 4d paws and sensram-rv 
of good facilities quick imagination lively spirits and open affectionate manners 
he was exactly formed to engage marian's heart 
for with all this he joined not only a cultivating person but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the exact leg of her own and which recommended him to her soon beyond everything else 
his society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment they read they talked they sang together 
his musical talents were considerable 
and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which edward had unfortunately wanted 
in mrs dashwood’s intimation he was as faultless as in marian's 
and linton saw nothing to ensure in him but a propensity in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister of saying too much what he thought on every occasion without attention to persons or circumstances 
in hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged and in lighting too easily the forms of worldly pro gaiety he displayed a want of caution which linton can d not approve in spite of all that he and marian could say in its sup rat 
marian began now to perceive that ll desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection had been rash and unjustiﬁable 
willoughby was all that her fancy had defeated in that unhappy hour and in every brighter period as capable of attracting her 
and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that red cat as amen as his qualities were strong 
er brother too in whose mind not one speculative thought of their marriage had been raised by his prospect of riches was led before the end of a week to hope and expect it and secretly to congratulate herself sense and sensibility 
4 on having gained two such sons-in-lnw as edward and willoughby 
colonel abandons partiality for marriage which had so early been discovered by his friends now first became perceptible to linton when it ceased to be noticed by them 
their attention and wit were drawn on to his more fortunate rival 
and the raillery which the other had occurred before any partiality arose was removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility 
linton was obliged though unwillingly to believe that the stem 
many which mrs penning had assigned him for her own satisfaction were now actually excited by her sister 
and that however n general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of mr willoughby an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the re rid of colonel grandson 
she saw it with concern 
or what could a silent man of ﬁve-und-thirty hope when exposed by a very lively one of five-and-twenty 
and as she could not even wish him successful she hurt wished him indifferent 
she liked him 
in spite of his gravity and reserve she beheld in him an object of interest 
his manners though serious were mild 
and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloonriness of lem 
sir john had dropped hint of past injuries and appointment which sustained her belief of his being an unfortunate man and she regarded him with respect and compassion 
perhaps she tried and esteemed him the more because he was weighted by willoughby and marian who prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young seemed resolved to undertake his merits 
a branded is just the kind of man a said willoughby one day when they were talking of him together whom everybody speaks well of and nobody cares i 
d 150 sense and sensibility 
about 
whom all are delighted to see and nobody remember to talk to that it exactly what i think him cried marian 
do not boat of it however a laid linton for it is injustice in both of you 
he in highly muted all the family at the park and i never see him in without taking paint to converse with him 
2 that he in patroniaed by jim lied willoughhy la certainly in all favour 
but for the esteem of the others it in a reproach in itself 
who would admit to the dignity of being approved by such women as lady middleton and man leaning that could command the indifference of anybody ell 2 3 but perhaps the blue of such people as yourself and marian will make amend or the regard of lady middleton and her mother

for they are not more undiaccrning than you ate prejudiced and unjust 
in defence of your protect you can even be saucy 
a my prove a you call him in a sensible man 
and same will always have attractions for me 
yes marian even in a man between this and forty 
he has been 3 great deal of the world 
he been abroad 
has read and has a thinking mind 
i have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects and he half always answered my inquiries with the readiness of good-breeding and good-natured that is to say a cried marian contemporary he has told you that in the em induce the climate in hot and the mosquitoes are troublesome 
a he would have told me lo i doubt not had i made an inch in spirit 
but they penistone iota on which i had been previously inforrliied.” pro sense and sensibility

but why should you dislike him 
d i do not dislike him 
i consider him on the contrary as a very respectable man who ha everybody 
good word and nobody notice 
who has more in than he can spend more time than he know how to empty and two new cost eve year

that he has neither genius taste nor spirit 
that his understanding ha no brilliancy him feeling 
no ardour and hit voice no expreodon.’ b you decide on his in reflection in much in the man a replied linton can no much on the men of your own imagination that the commendation i am able to give of him in comparatively cold and injun d 
i can on pronounce him to be a sensible man we hired well-ingmned of gentle address and i believe pondering an amiable heart a minor dead-wood a cried willoughby b you are now using me kindly 
you are endeavouring to inform me reason and to convince me against my will 
but it will not do

chapter of 
little had my dead-wood or her daughter imagined when they came link into devonshire that so many engagement would arise to on a their time as shortly presented themselves or that they should have such frequent invitations and such comma visitors an to leave them little leisure for serious employment 
yet such was the case 
when marian was recovered the schemes of amusement at home and abroad which sir john had been seriously forming were put in execution 
the private flap at the park then began 
and articles on the water were made and accomplished as o ten at a shower october would allow 
in every meeting of the kind willoughby want included 
and the case and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give incrmu'ng intimacy to his acquaintance with the daehwoodt to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellence 
of marian of marking his animated admiration of her and of receiving in her behaviour to himself the most pointed assurance of her affection 
linton could not be surprised at their attachment 
she only wished that it were less openly shown and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of come self-command to marian 
but rann abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserved 
and to aim at the restraints of sentiment which were not in themselves inaudible appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort but a disgraceful subjection of reason to commonplace and mistaken notions 
willoughby thought the same 
and their behaviour at all times was an illustrate of their opinions 
when he was present the had no eye for any one sense and sensibilities 
if else 
everything he did was right 
everything he i was clever 
if their evenings at the park were concluded with cards he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand 
if dancing formed the amusement of the night they were partners for half the time 
and when obliged to separate flora couple of dances were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke in word to anybody else 
such conduct made them of course most exceedingly law hed at 
but ridicule could not shame and seemed hare y to provoke them 
mrs dashed entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them 
to her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind 
this was the season of happiness to marian 
her heart was devoted to willoughby and the fond attachment to scotland which she brought with her from sussex was more likely to he softened than she had thought it possible before by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home 
a almonds happiness was not so great 
her heart was not so much at ease nor her satisfaction in their amusementssopure 
th afforded her no come notion that could make amends or what she had left hind nor that could teach her to think of ireland with less regret than ever 
neither lady middleton nor my penning could sup lay to her the conversation she missed 
although e latter was an everlasting talker and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which insured her a large share of her discourse 
she had already led her own history to linton three or four times 
and had elinor’s memory been equal to her means of improvement she might have known very early in her acquaintance all the particulars of mr jennings’s last 4 sense and sinslbllﬂ'v 
illness and what he laid to hit wife a few minutes before he died 
lady middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent 
linton needed little observation to perceive that her reserve wan a mere calmness of manner with which acme had nothing to do 
towards her husband and mother the wan the same as to them 
and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired 
she had nothing to lay one day that she had not said the day before 
her nipped 
it was invariable for even her spirit were always the same 
and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband provided everything were conducted in after and her two eldest children attended her she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in getting at home 
— 
and so little did her presence add to the plea of the others by any chin in their action that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys 
in colonel grandson alone of all her new acquaintance did editor and a prison who could in any degree claim the respect of listen excite the interest of friendship or give pleasure an a companion 
willowy was out of the question 
her admiration and red even her airily regard wan all his own but he won a lover 
his attention were wholly marian and a far less agreeable man might have been more general pleasing 
colonel grandson unfortunately for himself had no such encouragement to think only of marian and in conversing with linton he found the greatest consolation for the total indifference of her finger 
belinda companion for him increased as he had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known by him 
this suspicion was given by some word which accidentally drops from him sense ask 
sensibility 
one evening at the park when they were sitting down together b mutual consent whiz e the others were dancing eyes were fixed on marriage and after a silence of some minutes he said with a faint smile 2 your sister i understand does not approve of second attachments d no replied elixir 
a her opinions are all romantic c or rather as i believe she considered them impossible to exist d i believe she does 
but how she contrives it without reflection on the character of her own father who had him two wives i know not 
a few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation 
and then they may be more easy to dense and to than they now are by an y but herself a his will probably be the case he replied 
and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions 
d i can not agreed with you there a said linton 
there are inconveniences attending such feelings as marian's which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for 
her eyes have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought 
and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forward to as her greatest possible advantage after a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying 
a does your sister make no distinction in her objections a just a second attachment 
or is it equally criminal in everybody 
are those who have been disappointed in their first choice whether from the constancy of its object or the perverseness of circumstances to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives 2 3 60 stirs 
and sensibility 
upon my word 
i am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles 
i only know tint i never yetheordher admit any income of mood attachment i being pardonable 
within a said he a can not 
hold 
but i change 
a total change of moment 
no 
no do not done it 
for when the romantic refinement of a young mind are obliged to give way how frequently are they unnerved by ouch opinion as are but too common and too dangerously i speak from experience 
i once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly notch r sister who thought and judged like her but who am an enforced change 
from a series of unfortunate circumstances 
— here he stopped suddenly 
appealed to think that he had said too much and by his countenance gave rise to conjecture 
which might not otherwise have entered elinor'l haul 
the lad would probably have matted without suspicion un he not convinced mix wood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips 
or it was it required but a alight effort of fancy to connect hit emotion with the tender recollection of past regard 
linton a no more 
but lausanne in her place would not hove done so little 
the whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination and everything published in the most melancholy order of disastrous love 
chapter of 
s editor and marian were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of new to her visitor which in spite of all that he knew before of marian's imprudence and want of thought surprised her by it extravagant testimony of sense and sensibility 
both 
marian told her with the greatest delight that willoughby had given her a horse one that he and bred himself on his estate in somersetthire and which was exactly calculated to any a woman 
without considering that it was not in her mother s plan to keep any one 
that if the were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift she must buy another for the servant and keep a servant to ride it and after all build a stable to receive them 
the had accepted the present without hesitating and told her sister of it in rapture 
he intended to send his groom into somene’tshire immediately for it she added and when it arrives we will ride every day 
you shall share its use with me 
imagine to yourself my dear linton the delight of a slop on some of these downs 
most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to come reread all the unhappy truth which attended the a it and for some time she refined to submit to them 
as to an additional servant the expense would be a trifle 
command the was sure would never object to it 
and any horse would do for in 
he might always get one at the park 
as to a smile the merest shed would be sufficient 
linton then ventured to doubt the pro gaiety of her receiving such a pretext from a man so lit e or at least so lately known to her 
this was too much 
you are mistaken minor a aid the warm 
in supposing i know very little of 
willoughby 
have not known him long indeed but i am much better acquainted with him than i am with any other creature in the world except yourself and morcar 
it is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy 
— it ll disposition alone 
seven years would be inefficient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven days are more than enough for others 
i should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a 18 sense and sensibility 
home from my brother than from willoughhy 
of john i know very little though we have lived together for years 
but of willoughhy my judgment has long been formed elixir thought it 
wisest to touch that point no more 
she knew her sisters temper 
opposition on so tender 2 subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion 
but by an appeal to her affection for her mother by representing the inconvenience which that indulgent mother must draw on herself if as would probably be the case she contented to this increase of establishment marian was shortly subdued 
and she promised not to turn t her mother to such imprudently kindness by mentioning the older and to tell willoughby when the saw him next that it must he declined 
she was faithful to her word 
and when willoughby called at the cottage the tame day elixir heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present 
the reasons for this alteration were at the same time related and they were such as to make further enemy on his side impossible 
his concern however was very apparent 
and after ax resting it with earnestness he added in the same ow voice 
a but marian the horse ll still yours though you can not use it now 
i shall keep it on till you can claim it 
when you leave barton to her your own establishment in a more lasting 
home queen mall shall receive on 
y this was all overheard by miss dead-wood 
and in the whole of the sentence in his manner of pronouncing it and in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone she instantly saw an intimacy 10 decided a meaning so direct at marked a perfect agreement between them 
from that moment she doubted not sense and smxruurv 
9 of their being engaged to each other 
and the belief of it created no other rise than that the or any of their friend should be eft by temper no frank to recover it by accident 
margaret related something to her the next day which placed this matter in a still clearer light 
willingly had spent the preceding evening with them and margaret by being left come time in the parlour with only him and rann had had opportunity for observations which with a most important face the communicated to her eldest linger when they were next by themselves 
old linton d she cried 
i have such a secret to tell you about marriage 
i am cure the will be married to mr willoughby very soon 
you have laid to a replied elixir almost every day since they burst met on high-church downs and the had not known each other a week i believe here you were certain that mortimer wore his course round her neck 
but it turned out to be any the miniature of our glut-uncle 
a but indeed thin in quite another thing 
i am nun they will he married very soon for he has got a lock of her hair take care margaret 
it may be only the hair of some great-uncle of bit 
a but indeed plainer it in marian s 
i am almost sure it is for i saw him out it on 
last night after tea when you and mamma went out of the room were whispering and talking together up an as could be and he seemed to be begging something of her and presently he took up her scissors and cut of a long lock of her hair for it was all tumbled down her back 
and he kissed it and folded it up in a piece of white paper and put it into his pocket-book from such particular stated on such authority 60 sense and sensibility 
linton could not withhold her credit nor was she disposed to it for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself 
margaret sagacity was not always imaged in a way so satisfactory to her sister 
when is penning attacked her one evening at the park to give the name of the young man who was linton s particular favourite which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her margaret answered by looking at her sister and saying i must not tell may i elixir 
this of course made everybody laugh 
and linton tried to laugh too 
but the effort was painful 
she was convinced that margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with mrs penning 
marian felt for her most sincerely 
but she did more harm than good to the cause by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to margaret 
a remember that whatever your conjectures may be you have no right to repeat them i never had any conjectures about it replied margaret 
it was you who told me of it yourself 
this increased the mirth of the company and margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more 
oh 
pray miss margaret let us know all about it said mrs penning 
what is the gentleman's name i must not tell marian 
but i know very well what it is 
and i know where he is too 
a yes yes we can guess where he is 
at his own house at normandy to be sure 
he is the curate of the parish i dare say no 11th 
he is not 
he is of no profession at all 
margaret d said marian with great warmth sense and sensibility 
o 
you know that all this is an invention of your own and that there is no such person in existence 
well then he is lately dead marian for i am sure there was such a man once and his name begins with an f most grateful did editor feel to lady middleton for observing at this moment 2 that it rained very hard a though she believed the interruption to proceed less from an attention to her than from her lad ship's great die like of all such elegant subjects of rain cry as delighted her husband and mother 
the idea however started by her was immediately pursued by colonel grandson who was on every occasion handful of the feelings of others 
and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them 
willoughby opened the pinafore and asked marines to sit down to it 
and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic it fell to the ground 
but not so easily did editor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her 
a party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very line place about twelve miles from barton belonging to a brother-in-law of colonel grandson without whose interest it 
could not be seen as the proprietor who was then abroad had left strict orders on that head 
the grounds were declared to be highly beautiful and sir john who was clearly warm in their praise might be allowed to a tolerable judge for he had formed parties to visit them at least twice every summer for the last ten years 
they contained a noble piece of water 
a sail on which wan to form a great part of the mornings amusement 
cold provisions were to be taken open carriage only to ee employed and everything conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure 
2 sense and sensibility 
to some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking 
considering the time of year and that it had rained every day for the lane fortnight 
— and my dead-wood who had already a cold was persuaded by linton to stay at home 
then off 
heir intended exception to whiten turned out very differently from what linton had expected 
she was prepared to be wet through fatigued and fro hastened 
but the event was still more unfortunate or they did not go at all 
by ten o'clock the whole party were ambled at the park where th were to breakfast 
the morning was rather favourable e though it had mind all night i 
the clouds were then disposing across the city and the inn frequently appeared 
they were all in high spirits good humour eager to be happy and determined to submit to the greater 
convenience and hardship rather than be otherwise 
while they were at breakfast the letter were brought in 
among the rent there wan one for colonel grandson 
— he took it looked at the direction changed colour and immediately left the room 
a what in the matter with brandy 10 laid sir john 
nobody could tell i hope he has had no bad news laid lady middleton 
a it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel grandson leave my breakfast-table to suddenly in about ever minute he returned 
d no bad news colonel i hope 3

d no main

v but how came the hand to discompose you in much if it was only a letter of business 
come come this wo n't do colonel

oh

in town i 
cried my penning 
what can you have to do in town at thin time of year 
a my own lose in great a he continued a in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party 
but i am the more concerned as i fear my presence in necessary to gain our admittance at whitely 
hat a blow upon them all was thin 
but if you write a note to the housekeeper mr grandson laid marian eagerly a will it not be sufficient 
a he shook his head 
we must go laid sir john 
it shall not be by sense and sensibility 
nut oil when we are so near it 
you can not go to town till to 
morrow branch that in all i wish it could be no basin nettled 
but it in not in my power to delay my journey after one day 
d if you would but let know what your business is said mr penning 2 we might see whether it could be put of or not a you would not be six hours later laid willoughby d if you were to defer your journey till our return i can not afford to lose an hour 
linton then heard willoughby say in a low voice to marian d there are some pack who most 
bear a party of pleasure 
london is one of them 
he wan afraid of catching cold i dare say and invented thin trick for getting out of it 
i would lay fifty guinea 
the letter was of his own writing a i have no doubt of it a replied marian 
there it no persuading you to change your mind grandson i know of old a said sir john 
2 when once you are determined on anything 
but however i hope on will think better of it 
consider here are the two lain carry come over from newton the three mile dnahwoods walked up from the cottage and mr willoughby got into hours before his usual time on put an to a to hitwell.” colonel random again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of dip sinning the any but at the nine time declared it to lee unavoidable 
a well then when will you come back again i hope we shall see you at barton added her lad ship e at noon at you can conveniently leave town 
an we must put or the party to whiten till you returned b you are very obliging 
but it in no uncertain when i may have it in my power to return that i dare not engage for it at all sense and sensibility 
of a oh he knelt and shall come back a cried sir john 
d if he in not here by the end of the week i shall go after him 
ay it do sir john cried my penning 
and then chap you may 2nd out what his burden in 
a do not want to pry into other unconcern i up he it it something he in ashamed of colonel brand-new horner were announced b you do not go to town on horseback do you i 
added sir john 
no 
only to hoping 
i shall then go poet 
a well as you are resolved to go i wish you a good journey 
but you had exchange your mind 
i nature you it in not in my power 
he then took leave of the whole party 
a in there no chance of my seeing you and your finger in town thin winter ma 
dashed i i am afraid none at all 
then i must bid you farewell for a longer time than i could with to do to marian he merely bowed and said nothing 
come colonel said mr 
joining before you go do let us know what you are going about 
he wished her a good morning and attended by sir john left the room 
the complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto restrained now burst forth universally 
and ethereal agreed again and again how provoking it war to lo disappointed 
i can guess what hi business in however a laid my penning exultingly 
can you ma'am 
said almost everybody 
a yet 
it is about minx william i am m 
e and who in miss williams 
asked marian 
what 
do you not know who miss william in 
i am sure you must have heard of her before 
she is i. e 60 sense and smsrnru'rv. a relation of the colonel my dear 
a near relation 
we will not say how near for r of shocking the young ladies then lowering her voice a little she said to linton she in his natural daughter 
a indeed 
oh 
yes 
and as like him as she can stare 
i dare any the colonel will leave her all his fortune when sir john returned he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event 
concluding however by observing that as they were all got together they must do something by way of being happy 
and after tome consultation it was agreed that although happiness could only he enjoyed at whitely 
they might procure a tolerably composure of mind by driving about the country 
the carriages were then ordered 
willoughby’n was lit and marian never looked ha piers than when the out into it 
he drove through tile part very fast an they were soon out of sight e and nothing more of them we seen till their return which did not happen till after the return of all the rent 
they both seemed delighted with their drive but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes while the others went on the downs 
it was settled that there should be a dance in the evening and that everybody should be extremely merry all day long 
some more of the camels came to dinner and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table which sir john observed with great contentment 
willoughby took his rural place between the two elder miss dashwooda 
my penning rat on elinor‘a right hand 
and they had not been long seated before the leant behind her and willoughby and said to marian loud enough for them both to hear if have found you out in spite of all your tricks 
i know where you spent the morning 
sense all angry 
6d marian coloured and replied very hastily a where in l b 
p did not you know a aid willoughby that we had been out in my curriclel a yes yes mr impudence i know that very well and l wan determined to and out where on had been to 
i hare you like your home mind rann 
it in a very large one i know and when i come to see you i hope you will have new-fumiuhed it for it wanted it very much when i was there six year a o 
marian turned away in great confusion 
my penning laughed heartily 
and linton found that in her resolution to know where they had been ohe had actually made her own woman inquire of mr willaughhy’r groom and that the had by that method been informed that they had gone to allen and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house 
linton could hardly believe this to be true a it seemed likely that illo hob should m or maxim consent to enter the home while smith was in it with whom marian had not the valley acquaintance 
a 
soon as they left the dining-room elixir inquired of her about it 
and great vex her surprise when the found that every circumstance related by my penning was perfectly true 
marian wan quite an my with her for doubting it 
why should you imagine linton that we did not go there or that we did not see the house 
ii not it what on have often wished to do yourself 
d as marian but i would not go while smith was there and with no other companion than mr willoughby 
mr willoughhy however in the only person who 18 sense and sunsrolu'rv 
can have a right to draw that home 
and wet in an open foliage it we impossible to have any other come notion 
i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life 
i am afraid a replied linton that the plenumneea of an employment doe 
not always evince its propriety 
on the contrary nothing can be a stronger proof of it linton 
for if there had been unreal impropriety in what i did i should have been sensible of it at the time for we always know when we are acting wrong and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure 3 but my dear marian a it has already expended on to tome very impertinent remarks do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct 
if the impertinent remarks of mrs penning are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct we are all offending every moment of all our lives 
i value not her endure any more than i should do her command lion 
i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mr 
sighs round or in seeing her home 
they will one day be mr willoughby'u and 
— d if they ware one do to be your own marriage you would not be justified in what you have done 
she blushed at thin hint 
but it was even tiny gratifying to her 
and after a ten minutes interval of earnest thought she came to her inner again and laid with great good humour perhaps plainer it war rather ill-judged in me to go to allen 
but mr willoughby wanted particularly to allow me the place 
and it is a charming home i assure you 
there in one remarkably pretty sitting-room upstairs of a nice comfortable size for complaint name and with modern future it would be delightful 
it is a corner room suds and snusrnxurv 
by and has windows on two sides 
on one side you look scroll the bowling-green behind the house to a beautiful hanging wood 
and on the other have a view of the church and village and on them of those ne hold hills that we have so of admired 
i did not see it so advance for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture 
but if it were newly fitted up 
o couple of hundred pounds willoughby says would make it one of the pleasantest lumber-room in england could elixir have listened to her without interruption from the others she would have described every room in the house with equal delight 
hum 117 
he sudden termination of colonel abandons visit at the park with his steadiness in concealing its cause yelled the mind and raised the wonder of mrs penning for two or three days she was a great wanderer as ever one must be who takes a very lively interest in the coming and goings of all their acquaintance 
she wondered with little intermission what could he the reason of it 
was sure there must be some bad news and thou hat over every kind of distress that could have belle en him with a fixed determination that he should not escape them all 
something very melancholy must be the matter i am sure a said she 
i could see it in his face 
poor man 
i am afraid his circumstances may he had 
the same at delal‘ord was never reckoned more than two thousand a year and his brother left everything sadly involved 
i do think he must have been sent for about 750 sense and sensibilities 
money matters for what else can it be 
i wonder whether it is no 
i would give anything to know the truth of it 
perhaps it is about ma island by the bye i dare say it it became he looked in conscious when i mentioned her 
maybe she it ill in town 
nothing in the world more likely for i have a notion the is always a rather sickly 
i would lay any wager it is about in williams 
it is not so very likely he should be distressed in hit circumstance em for he is a very prudent man and to be cure mus have cleared the mate b thrill time 
i wonder what it can be 
maybe his sister is wore at vigor sod ha cent for him over 
hit setting off in ouch hurry seems very like it 
well i wish him out of all hit trouble with all my heart and a good wife into the bargain so wondered so talked mrs penning 
her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture and all seeming equally probable as they arose 
linton though she felt really interested in the welfare of colonel grandson could not bestow all the wonder on his going to suddenly away which man leaning was desirous of her feeling 
for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation her wonder was otherwise disposed of 
it was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and willoughby on the subject 
which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them all 
an this fence continued every day made it appear more strange and more incomparable with the dim scion of both 
why they should not of only know edge to her mother and herself what their constant behaviour to each other declared to have taken place linton could not imagine 
she could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power 
for though willoughby was independent there was no reason to believe him rich 
his estate had been hated by sir john at about ax or sense and sensibility 
7 i seven hundred a year 
hut he lived at an xx to which that incarnate could hardly be equal a he had himself often complained of hi 
poverty 
but for thin strange kind of secrecy maintained by them relative to their en garment which in fact concealed nothing at all the co d not account 
and it was no wholly contradictory of their general opinions and practice that a doubt sometimes entered her mind of their being really engaged and this doubt wan enough to prevent her making any inquiry of marian 
nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all then willoughhy’n behaviour 
to marian it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover heart could give and in the mat of the family it wan the affectionate attention of a m and a brother 
the cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home 
many more of hi 
hours were spent there than at allen 
and if no general engagement collected them at the park the exercise which called him out in the morning wan almost certain of ending there where the rest of the day was pen by himself all the tide of marian and by his favourite pointer at her feet 
one evening in particular about a week aﬂercolonel grandson had felt the country his heart seemed more than usually open to ever feeling of attachment to the objects around him 
an on my duhwood’e happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring he warmly harmed every alteration of a place which affection enahliehed as perfect with him 
what 
a he exclaimed 
a improve this dear cottage 
no 
it i will never consent to 
not a none must be added to its walls not an inch to in rite if my feelings are regarded do not be alarmed said mine dead-wood 2 sense and sensibility 
a nothing of the kind will he done 
for my mother will never have no enough to attempt it 
i am he ay glad of it a he cried 
maybe alway s be poor if the can employ her riches no better thank you willoughby 
but you ma be assured that i would not sacrifice one sentiment of coal attachment of yours or of anyone whom i loved for all the improvements in the world 
depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain when i make up my accounts in the spring i would even rather la it useless 
by than dispute of it in a manner so inland to you 
tint are you really so attached to this ace as to see no defect in it i 
i am a said he 
to me it is limitless 
nay more i consider it as the only form of building to which happiness is actionable 
and were i rich enough i would instantly pull combe down and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage 
e with dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that stricken i suppose said linton 
a yes cried he in the same eager tone e with all and everything belonging to it 
— in no one convenience or inconvenience about it should the least variations be perceptible 
then and then one under such a most might perhaps be as happy at tube as i have been at barton 
d i fatter myself a replied elixir 
that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase you will hereafter and your own house as faultless as you now do this 
d there cecily are circumstances said willingly which might greatly near it to me 
but this place will always have one claim on my affection which no other can any share 
mrs dashed corked with pleasure at marian whose ones eyes were fixed so expressive on sense and smsimurv 
3 willoughby a plainly denoted how well she understood him 
how often did i wish added he 
when i was at allen this same twelvemonth that barton cottage were inhabited 
i never passed within view of it without admiring its situation and grieving that no one should live in it 
how little did i then think that the very first news i should hear from my smith when i next came into the country would be that barton cottage was taken 
and i felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event which nothing but a kind of science of what happens i should experience from it can account for 
must it not have been so marriage i 
speaking to her in a lowered voice 
then continuing his former tone he mid and yet this home you would spoil mrs dead-wood 
you would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement 
and this mr parlour in which our acquaintance tint began and in which so many hai hours have been since not i 
us together you we d degrade to the condition of a common entrance and everybody would be eager to pass through h the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could penny afford 
my dashed again matured him that no alteration of the kind should be attempted 
you are a good woman 3 he warmly replied 
your promise makes me easy 
extend it a little farther and it will make me happy 
tell me that not only our house will remain the same but that i shall ever and you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling 
and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me 
the promise was readily given and willoughby’u 7s snusr-z and snusrnru'rv 
behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness 
a shall we see you to-morrow to dinner 2 3 mid mr dashed when he was leaving them 
d i do not ask you to come in the morning for we must walk to the park to call on lady middleton he engaged to he with them by four o'clock 
hum 
9th 
mrs dashwood’s visit to lady middleton took place the next day and two of her daughter went with her 
but marian excused herself from being of the party under name trifling pretext of em lament 
and her mother who concluded that a promise had been made in willoughhy the night before of calling on her while they were about 
perfect fatigued with her remaining at home 
on their return me the park they found willoughby’l chronicle and servant in waiting at the cottage and my dashed was convinced that her conjecture had been just 
so far it wan all as she had foreseen 
but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect 
they were no sooner in the passage than radiance came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent fiction with her handkerchief at her eyes and without noticing them run up-stairs 
surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted where they found only willoughby who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his back towards them 
he turned round on their coming in and his countenance showed that he strongly partook of the emotion which overpowered marian 
sense and sensibility 
150 
is anything the matter with her i cried my dashed as she entered 
2 is the ill 
i hope not he replied trying to look cheerful 
and with a forced smile presently added a it is i who may gather expect to be ill 
for i am now muttering under a very heavy disappointment 
dismay ointment 
d a yes or i am unable to keep my engagement with mrs smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor d eat cousin by sending me on business london 
have just received my despatched and taken my farewell of allen 
and by way of exhilaration i am now come to take my furnace of you 
b c to london l 
and are you going this morning in a almost this moment 
this is very unfortunate 
but mr smith must be obliged 
and her business will not detain you from us long i hope 
he coloured as he replied a you are very kind but i have no idea of returning into devonshire immediately 
my visits to mrs smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth 
e and is mrs smith your only friend 
is allen the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome 
for shame willoughby 
can you wait for an invitation here 2 3 his colour increased 
and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied a you are too good 
my dead-wood looked at linton with surprise 
linton felt equal amusement for a few moments every one was silent mrs dead-wood first key 
i have only to add my dear wi naughty that at barton cottage you will always be welcome 
for i will not press you to return here immediately because you only can judge how far that might be p ceasing to my 60 sense and sensibility 
smith 
and on this head i shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclinations 
a my engagements at present a replied willoughby confusedly 
are of such a nature 
that 
i dare not matter myself 
— he slept 
mrs dashed was too much astonished to speak and another pause succeeded 
this was broken by willnughby 
who said with a faint smile 2 it is folly to linger in this manner 
i will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy he then hastily took leave of them all and left the room 
they saw him step into his carriage and in a minute it was out of sight 
mrs dashed felt too much for speech and instantly quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned 
elinor’s uneasiness was at least equal to her mother 
she thought of what had just passed with anxiety and disgust 
willoughby’s behaviour in taking leave of them his embarrassment and agitation of cheerfulness and above all his unwillingness to accept her mother invitation a backwardness so unlike a lover 
so unlike himself greatly dimmed her 
one moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side 
and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister 
the distress in which marian had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for 
though when she considered what marian's love for him was a quarrel seemed almost am able 
but whatever might be the particular as of their separation her sisters application was inevitable 
and she thought with the tenderest come scion of that violent sorrow which marian was in all probability not merely suds and sensibility 
77 giving way to as relief but feeding and encouraging as a a 
in atlysout half an hour her mother returned and though her eyes were red her countenance was not cheerful 
a our dear willoughby is now some miles from barton linton said she as she sat down in work and with how heavy a heart does he travel l b 
it is all very strange 
so suddenly to be gone 
it seems butcher work of a moment 
and last night was with us so happy so cheerful so affectionate 
and now after only ten minutes notice-gone me without intending to return 
something more than what he owned to us must have happened 
he did not speak he did not behave like himself 
tai must have seen the difference as well up i 
what can it be 
can they have quarrelled why else should he have shown such unwillingness to accept your invitation here 
— a it was not inclination that he wanted elixir 
i could plainly see bat 
he had not the power of accepting it 
i have thought it all over i assure you and i can perfectly account for everything that at rest seemed strange to me as well as to you a can you indeed i 
yes 
i have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way 
— 
hut you linton who love to doubt where you can 
it will not satisfy you i know 
but you shall not talk in out of my trust in it 
i am persuaded that mrs smith suspect his regard for marriage disapproved of it kramm because she has other views for him and on t account is eager to get him away 
— and that the business which she sends him off to transacted is invented as an excuse to dismiss him 
this is what i believe to have happened 
he is moreover aware that she doe disapprove the confusion he dares 18 sense and snusmu'rv 
not therefore at present confess to her hip engagement with marian and he feel himself obliged from his dependent situation to give into her scheme and absent himself from devonshire for a while 
you will tell me i know that thin may or may not have happened 
but i will listen to no avail unleeeyou can point outcry other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory as this 
and now linton what have you to any 
a 
nothing for you have anticipated my only/er.” 2 then you would have told me that it might or might not have happened 
oh 
linton how incomprehemibk are your feelings 
you had rather take evil upon credit than good 
you had rather look out for misery for marriage and guilt for poor willoughlry than an apology for the latter 
you are resolved to think him blamable became he took leave of us with lens affection than his usual behaviour renown 
and is no allowance to be made for inadvertence 
or far spirited decreased by recent disappointment 
are no probabilities to be accepted merely became they are not certainty 
in nothing due to the man whom we have all i 
much reason to love and no mean in the world to think ill of 
to the possibility of motive 
unamwemble in themselves though unavoidably secret for a while 
and after all what in it you rupee him of 
i can hardly tell you myself 
but suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable corn offence of such an alteration an we have just wit in him 
there it great truth however in what you have now urged of the allowance 
which ought to be made for him and it it my wish to be candid in my judgment of everybody 
though may undoubtedly have very sufficient runs for his conduct and i vii hope that he hat 
but it would have been more like willoughby to acknowledge them at once 
secrecy my be adviesense and sensibility 
7th able 
but still i can not help wondering at its being practised by him a do not blame him however for departing from his character when the devastation is necessary 
but you really do admit the justice of what i have said in his defence 
— i am happy 
and he is acquitted d not entirely 
it may be proper to conceal their engagement if they are engaged from mrs smith 
and if that is the case it must be highly expedient for willoughhy to be but little in devonshire at present but this is no excuse for their concealing it from us 
concealing it from ull my dear child do you accuse willoughby and marian of concealment 
this is strange indeed when your eyes have been approaching them every day for incautiousness 
i want no proof of their affection d said linton 
a but of their engagement i do a i am perfectly satisfied of both yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject by either of them 
i have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly 
has not his behaviour to marian and to all of us for at least the last fortnight declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation 
have we not perfectly understood each other 
has not my consent been daily asked by his looks his manner his attentive and affectionate respect 
my linton is it possible to doubt their engagement 
how could such a thought occur to you 
how is it to he supposed that willoughh persuaded as he must he of your sister love should d leave her and leave her perhaps for months without telling her of his all'ecu'on 
— 
that they should part without a mutual exchange of conﬁdence.” 
i confess a replied linton that every circus sense and sensiiiili‘i'v 
dance except one it in favour of an engagement but that an is the total silence of both on the object and with me it almost outweighevery other a how strange this is 
you mun think wretchedly indeed of willoughby if after ill that ha openly between them you can doubt the nature the tea on which they are together 
half he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all thin time 
do you in pane him really indignant to her 
a d i i can not think that 
he must and do 
love her i am lure but with a mange kind of gentlemen if he can leave her with such indifference touch careleuneu of the future as you attribute to him 
b you must remember my dear mother that i have never considered thin matter as certain 
i have had my doubts i confess 
but they are fainter than they were and they may noon be entire 
done away 
if we find they correspond every fear of mine will be removed 
d a mighty concession indeed 
if you were to see them at the altar you would suppose that they were going to be married 
ungracimu girl i but i require no luck roof 
nothing in my opinion ha ever paused to justify doubt 
no secrecy ha 
been attempted s all has been uniformly open and unnerved 
you can not doubt your sister wishes 
it must be willoughby therefore whom you expect 
but why 
is he not a man of honour and feeling 
than there been any inconsistency on his side to create asylum 
can he be deceitful 
d i he not i believe not cried linton 
d i love willowy y sincerely love him 
and on scion of hit integrity can not be more painful to yourself than to me 
it has been involuntary and i will not encourage it 
i wan startled i confess by the alteration in his manner this morning 
he did not speak like himself and did sense and snitsrsan-v. 89 not return your kindness and with cordiality 
but all this may be explained by such a situation a his affairs as you have supposed 
he had just parted from my jim had seen her leave him in the greatest affection 
and if he felt obliged from a fear of offending mrs smith to resist the temptation of returning here soon and yet aware that by declining your invitation by saying that he was going away for some time he should seem to act an generous a suspicious part by our family he might well be embarrassed and disturbed 
in arch a case a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour i think as well as more consistent with his general character 2 
it i will not raise objections against any one conduct on so illihcral in foundation up a difference in judgment from myself or a deviations from what i may think right and consistent 
b you k ve no i 
willoughb certainly does not one toy siifpeyeted 
though we m not known him long 
he is no stranger in this part of the world 
and who has ever key to his disadvantage 
had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledgment everything to me at once but this is not the case 
it is an engagement in some respects not prosperous begun for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance 
and even secrecy as far as it can be observed may now be very advisable 
they were interrupt by the entrance of margaret 
and linton was then at li to think over the presentation of her mother to acknowledge e the probability of many and hope for the justice offal 
they saw nothing of france till dinner time when she entered the room and took her place at the table without saying a word 
her eyes were red and swollen 
i. i 82 sense and srmsmu'rv 
and it seemed n if her nearer even then restrained with difficulty 
she avoided the looks of them all could neither eat nor speak and after came time on her mother silently pressing her hand with tender companion her small degree of fortitude was quit overcome 
the burst into tears and left the room this violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening 
she wan without any power became the was without any desire of command over herself 
the slightest mention of anything relative to willoughby overpowered her in an instant 
and though her family were most anxiously attentive to her comfort it umf impose bibles for them if they keep at all to keep clear of every subject which her feelings connected with him 
calm 117 arrange would have thought herself ve inexcusable had she been able to keep at l the first night after parting from willoughby 
she would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than when the lay down in it 
but the feelings which made such complain a disgrace 
left her in no danger of curving it 
she wan awoke the whole night and the wept the greatest part of it 
she or up with a headache wan unable to talk and until in to take any nourishment 
giving pain e moment to her mother and sisters and forbidding attempt at consolation from either 
her sensibility woe potent enough 
when breakfast was over she walked out by himself and wandered about the village of allen indulging the recollection of part enjoyment and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning 
july sense and ansmu-rv 
83 the evening of in the usual indulge co of feeling

why do you not ask marian at once a aid she a whether the in or in not engaged to willonghbyl from you her mother and to kind to indulgent a mother the question could not give offence 
it would be the natural result of your affection for her 
she need to be all reserve and to you more especially 
i would not ask inch 3 question for the world 
supposing it be that they are not engaged what distress would not such an inquiry inflict at any rate it would be most generous 
i should never deceived her confidence again after forcing from her a confession of what in mean at present to be acknowledged to any one 
i know marianne’e heart i know that she dearly love me and that i shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known when circummncea make the resentment of it eligible

but it gave elixir pleasure as it deduced a t from marian so expressive of confidence in w ought and knowledge of his intentions 
one morning about a week after his leaving the country marian was prevailed on to join her sister in their usual walk instead of wandering away by herself 
hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in her rambles 
if her sisters intended to walk on the downs she directly stole away towards the lanes if th talked of the valley the was as speedy in climbing e hills 
and could never be found when the others set off 
but at length she was secured by the exertions of linton who great disapproved ouch continual seclusion 
they walked along the road through the valley and chilly in silence for marian's mind could not be controlled and linton satisfied with gaining one point would not then attempt more 
beyond the entrance of the valley where the country though still rich was less wild and more eyes a long stretch of the rend which they had travel on first coming to bestow lay before them 
and on reaching that point they stopped to look around them and examine a prospect which formed the distance of their view from the cottage from a mat which they had never happened to reach in any of their walks before 
amongst the objects in the scene they soon discovered in arm one 
it was a man on horseback riding towards them 
in a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman 
and in a moment afterwards marian rapturously exclaimed it is he 
it is indeed

and the village itself in a much higher situation than the cottage afforded a general view of the whole which had exceedingly pleased him

because believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel and it disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and lens discrimination in viewing them himself than he he ll fastidious and will have an aﬁ'ectau'on of his own

i like a one prospect but not on picturesque principles 
i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees 
i admire them much more if they are tall might and flourishing 
i don't like ruined tattered cottages

marian looked with amazement at edward with compassion at her finger 
linger only laughed 
sense and sensibility 
9th the subject was continued no farther 
and marian remained thoughtfully silent all a new object suddenly engage ed her attention 
she was sitting down and in taking his tea from mrs dash his hand passed so directly before her as to make a ring with a plait of hair in the centre very conspicuous on one of his fingers 
d i never saw you wear a ring before edward d she cried 
is that fanny hair 
i remember her promising to give you some 
but i should have thought her hair had been darkened marian spoke inconsiderate what she really felt 
but when she saw how much she had ned edward her own vexation at her want of thing r. could not be surpassed by his 
he coloured ve deeply and giving a momentary glance at linton re lied d as it is my sister s hair 
he setting always cast a different shade on it you know liquor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise 
that the hair was her own she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as marian 
the only difference in their conclusions was that what marian 
considered as a free gift from her sister linton was conscious must have been procured by some them or contrivance unknown to herself 
she was not in s humour however to regard it as an afloat and affecting to take no notice of what had passed by instantly talking of something else she internally resolved hence forward to catch every ofpommity of eyeing the hair and satisfying herself beyond all doubt that it was exactly the shade of her own 
towards embarrassment lasted some time and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled 
he was particularly grave the whole coming 
marian severely ensured herself for what sh has said 
but her own i. g 18 sense and srmsrnm-rv 
forgiveness might have been more ready had the known how little silence it had given her sister 
before the middle of the day they were valued by sir john and man leaning who having heard of the arrival of n gentleman at the cottage came to take a curve of the gum with the distance of hit mother-in-law sir john was not long in discovering that the name of terror began with an f and thin repaired a future mine of raillery against the devoted linton which nothing but the newness of their acquaintance with edward could have prevented from being immediately sprung 
but an it was the only learned from some very significant looks how for their ration founded on mnrgalet’l instruction extent sir john never came to the manhood without either inviting them to dine at the park the next day or to drink tea with them that evening 
on the present occasion for the better entertainment of their visitor towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute he wished to engage them for both

9th this and marian's blushing gave new to edward 
e and who is wi naughty 
a said he in a low voice to miss touchwood by whom he was sitting 
she gave him a brief reply 
marianne’l countenance was more communicative 
edward saw enough to comprehend not only the meaning of others but much of marian's expressions as had puzzled him before 
and when their minds left them he went immediately round her and laid in a whisper i have been dressing 
shall i tell you my guess 
a hat do ou mean 
a shall i tell you 
certainly a well then i guess that mr willoughby hunts 
marian was surprised and confused yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner and after a moment s silence said john edward 
how can you p 
but the time will come i hope 
i am sure you will like him 
i do not doubt it replied he rather astonished at her earnestness and warmth 
for had he not imagined it to he s joke for the good of her acquaintance in general founded only on a something or a nothing atween mr willingly and herself he would not lave ventured to mention it 
hum 3 
toward remained a week at the cottage 
he was earnestly pressed by mrs dashed to stay longer 
but as if he were bent only on self-mortiﬁcation he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height 
his looks skins and sensibility 
prima during the in two or three days though still very unusual were greatly improved 
he grew more and more partial to the house and environs 
never spoke of going away without a tin h 
declared his time to be wholly disengaged 
even united to what place he should go when he left them 
but still go he must 
never had any week passed so quickly 
he could hardly believe it to be gone 
he said so repeatedly 
other things he said too which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions 
he had no pleasure at normandy 
be detected being in town 
but either to scotland or london he must go 
he valued their kindness beyond anything and his greatest happiness in being with them 
yet he must leave them at the end of a week in spite of their wishes and his own and without any restraint on his time 
linton placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother account 
and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so perfectly known m her as to he the general excuse for everything strange on the part of her son 
data pointed however and vexed as she was and sometimes pleased with his uncertain behaviour to herself 
she waver well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowance and generous qualifications which had been rather more painfully extorted from her for willoughby s service by her mother 
his want of spirits of openness and of consistency were most usually attributed to his want of independence and his better knowledge of mrs ferrets dispositions and designs 
the shortness of his visit the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them originated in the same fettered inclination the same inevitable necessity of terrorising with his mother 
the old well-polished grievance of duty against will parent against child was the cause of all 
she would have been glad to know when these dilﬁculsense and sensibility 
d i ties were to create this opposition was to yield 
when mrs ferrets would be reformed and her can be at l. to be happy 
but from inch vain wished 
the was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in edward affecting to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from milan while at barton and above all to that battering proof of it which he constantly wore round his danger 
i think edward d said my dashed as they were at breakfast the last morning you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plan and actions 
some inconvenience to your friends indeed might result from it 
you would not be able to give them so much of your time 
but with a smile you would be materially bench in one particular at least 
you would know where to go when you left them i do assure you he replied that i have long thought on this point as you think now 
it has been and is and probably will always be a heavy misfortunes me that i have had no necessary business to engage me no profession to give me em enjoyment or afford me anything like independence 
blunt unfortunately in own nicety and the nicety of my friends have made me what i am an idle helpless being 
we never could agree in our choice of a profession 
i always preferred the church an i still do 
but that was not mort enough for my family 
they recommended the army 
that was a great deal too smart for me 
the law wan allowed to be genteel enough 
many young men who had chambers in the temple made a very good appearance in the first circles and drove about town in very knowing gigs 
but i had no inclination for the law even in this less abstruse study of it which my family approved 
a for the nay it had fashion on its side or sense and sensibility 
but i wan too old when the subject ram first named to enter g 
and at length at then wan no recruit for my having any profession at all as i might be an aching and expensive without a. red coat on my back a with one idleness wan pronounced on the whole to be the most advantageous and honourable and a young man of eighteen in not in general it eagerly bent on being buy no to resist the limitation 
of hit friend to do nothing 
i was therefore entered at oxford and have been properly idle ever since 
the consequence of which 
suppose will be a laid my dashed since leisure ll not prompted your own happiness that your tom will be brought up to at many pursuit employments profession and trades on collumella’a 
they will be brought up a said he in a serious accent to be as unlike myself as in double 
in feeling in action in condition in eve 
a me come 
thrill all an illusion o immediate want of spirits edward 
you are in n melancholy humour and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy 
but remember that the pain of parting from friend will be felt by eve body at times whatever be their education or state 
now your own happiness 
you want nothing but patience 
or give it a more fascinating name call it hope 
your mother will secure to you in time that independence you are no anxious for 
it in her duty and it will it mun ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent 
how much my not a few months do 
a d i think a replied edward that i may defy many month m pluck any good to me 
this desponding turn of mind though it could not be communicated to mrs touchwood gave additional pain to them all in the parting which shortly tool place sense and sensibility 
of and left an uncomfortable imprecations on elinor’a feelings by which required name trouble and arm to us 
but an it was her determination to subdue it and to prevent herself from a ring to fuller more than what all her family ruﬂ'erecinf his going away she did not adopt the method no judicious y employed by marriage on a similar occasion to argument and ax her now by asking silence solitude and idleness

linton sat down to her dressing-table a. tool a he was out of the home busily em loved herself the whole day neither sought nor avoided the mention of hi name appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general contempt of the family and if by thin conduct she did net lessen her own grief it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase and her mother and sister were spared much solitude on her account 
such behaviour an this so exactly the reverie of her own appeared no more meritorious to marian than her own had seemed faulty to her 
the huainmof self-command the settled very c lily 
— with strong affections it was impossible with calm once it could have no merit 
that her airily actions were calm the dared not deny though she blushed to acknowledge it 
and of the strength of her own the gave a very striking proof by still loving and respecting that sister in it of thin mortifying conviction 
without shutting herself up from her family or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them or laying awake the whole night to indulge meditation linton found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of edward and of edward behaviour in every possible variety which the direct rate of her spirit at different time could produce 
— with tender 104 sense and sensibility 
pity approbation century and doubt 
there were moments in abundance when if not by the absence of her mother and listen at least i the nature of their e moment conversion was forbidden among them every effect of solitude was produced 
her mind was inevitably at liberty 
her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere 
and the past and the future on a subject so interesting must be before her must force her attention and entrust her memory her reflection and her fancy 
from a reverie of this kind as she sat at her dressing-table the was mused one morning soon after edward s leaving them by the arrival of company 
she happened to be quite alone 
the closing of the little gate at the entrance of the green court in front of the house drew her eyes to the window and she saw a large part walking up to the door 
amongst them were sir john and lady middleton and mrs penning 
but there were two others a gentleman and lady who were quite unknown to her 
she was sitting near the window and as soon as sir john perceived her he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door and stepping across the turf obliged her to open the casement to speak to him though the space was so short between the door and the window as to make it hardly possible to speak at one without being heard at the other 
well a said he we have brought you some strangers 
how do you like them 
a rush 
they will hear you 
d never mind if they do 
it is only the palm 
marlott is very pretty i can tell you 
you may see her if you look this way as linton was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes without taking that liberty she begged to be excused 
sense and sensibility 
10th a where is marriage 
has she run away because we are come 
i see her instrument is open a she is walking i believe they were now joined by mrs penning who had not patience enough to wait till the door was open before she told bar story 
she came following to the window a how do you do my dear 
how does mrs dashed do 
and where are your sisters 
what 
all alone 
you will be glad of a little company to sit with you 
i have brought my other son and days her those you 
old think of their coming so so early 
i thought i d n carriage last night while we were drinking our tea but it never entered my had that it could be them 
i thought of nothing but whether it might not be colonel grandson come back again 
so i aid to sir john i do think i hear a carries a 
perhaps it is colonel grandson come back a sun 85 linton was obliged to turn from her in the middle of her story to receive the rest of the party 
lady middleton introduced the two strangers 
mrs hood and margaret came downstairs at the same time and they all sat down to look at one another while my penning continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour attended by sir john 
mrs palmer was several years younger than lady middleton and totally unlike her in every respect 
she was short and plump had a very pretty face and the honest expression of good humour in it that could possibly be 
her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister s but they were much more prepossessing 
she came in with 10 smile 
smiled all the time of her visit except when she laughed and smiled when she went awn 
her husband was a grave looking young man of ve or six and twenty with an air of more on and sense than his wife but of less willingness to please i of sense and sensibility 
or to be placed 
he entered the room with a look of self 
consequence slightly bowed to the ladies without picking a word and after briefly surveying them and i apartments took up a newspaper from the table and continued to read it as long as he mid 
mrs palmer on the contrary who was strongly endowed by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour and everything in it burst forth 
a well 
what a delightful room this is 
i never w anything so charming 
only think mamma how it is improved since i was here last 
i always i thought it such a sweet place ma'am turning to us manhood but you have made it so charming 
only look sister how delightful everything is 
how should like such a house for myself 
should not you mr palmer 
a mr palmer made her no answer and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper 
a mr palmer does not hear me said she laughing 
a he never does sometimes 
it is so ridiculous 
a this was quite a new idea to mrs dashed 
she had never been used to and wit in the inattention of any one and could not help looking with surprise at them both 
mrs joining in the meantime talked on as loud as she could and continued her account of their surprise the evening before on seeing their friends without ceasing till everything was told 
mrs palmer laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment and everybody agreed two or three times over that it had been quite an agreeable surprise 
b you may believe how glad we all were to see them a added mrs penning leaning forward towards linton and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard b no one else though they were seated on different of a m t but however i can't sense and sensibility 
10th help wishing they had not travelled quite so full nor made such a long journey of it for th came all round by london upon account of some lines for you know nodding tigniﬁcantly and pointing to her daughter it was wrong in her situation 
i wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning but she would come with us 
she longed so much to see you all 
a mrs palmer laughed and said it would not do her any harm 
d she expects to be convinced in february continued mrs penning 
lady middleton could no longer endure such a conversation and therefore exerted himself to ask mr palmer if there was any news in the paper 
d no none at all a he replied and read on 
2 here comes marian a cried sir john 
a now palmer you shall see a monstrous pretty girl he immediately went into the passage opened the front door and ushered her in himself 
my penning asked her as soon as she a are if she had not been to allen 
and mrs palmer laughed so heavily at the question as to show she understood it 
mr palmer looked up on her entering the room stared at 
her some minutes and then returned to hit newspaper 
mr palmer eye was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room 
she got up to examine them 
oh 
dear how beautiful these are 
well how delightful 
do but look common how sweet 
i declare they are quite charming 
i could look at them for ever and then sitting down again she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room 
when lady middleton rose to go away mr palmer roof also laid down the newspaper stretched himself and looked at them all round 
88 sense sun sensibility 
all y love have you been asleep 
a said his wife lulling 
e made her no answer and only observed after again examining the room that it was very low-pitched and that the ceiling was crooked 
he then made his bow and departed with the rest 
sir john had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at the park 
mrs daishwood who did not cause to dine with them oftener than they dined at the cottage absolutely refused on her own account 
her daughters might do as they pleased 
but they had no curiosity to see how mr and mrs palmer ate their dinner and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way 
they latter led therefore likewise to excuse themselves 
the west er was uncertain and not likely to be good 
but sir john would not be satisfied 
— the carriage should be sent for them and they must come 
lady middleton too though she did not press their mother pressed them 
mrs penning and mrs palmer joined their entreaties all seemed really anxious to avoid a family party and the younge‘ladies were obliged to yield 
2 why should they ask us i said marian as soon as th were gone 
4 the rent of this cottage is said to he ow 
but we have it on very hard terms if we are dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them or with us 
a they mean no less to be civil and kind to us now a said linton 2 by these frequent invitations than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago 
the alteration is not in them if their parties are grown tedious and dull 
we must look for the change elsewhere

she took them all most aﬂ'eetionntely by the hand and expressed great delight in seeing them again

ah

there is not much difference 
i never was at his house 
but they jay it in a sweet pretty place

i was impossible for any one to be more thoroughly good-natured or more determined to be happy than mr palmer 
the studied indifference insolence impel discontent of her husband gave her no pain 
and when he scolded or abused her the was highly diverted 
a r palmer in no droll l d said the in a whisper to linton 
a he is always out of humour 
linton was not inclined after a little observation to give him credit for being so genial and unafl'ecudly ill-natured or ill-bred as he wish to up or 
his temper might perhaps be a little secured by riding like many other of bit ax that through some unaccountable him in favour of beauty he wan the husband of a very silly woman

it was rather a witch of distinction

he palmer returned to levelled the next day and the two families at barton were again left to entertain each other 
but this did not lam long 
linton had hardly got their last visitors out of her head 
had hardly done wondering at charlotte’s being so happy without a cause at mr palmer acting so simply with good qualities and at the strange inevitableness which often existed between husband and wife before sir john and mrs penning active zeal in the cause of society procured her some other new acquainted once to see and observe 
in a moving excursion to execute they had met with two young ladies whom mrs penning had the satisfaction of discovering to be her relations and this was enough for sir john to invite them directly to the park as soon as their present en events at exerted were over 
their engagements at peter instantly gave way before such an invitation and lady middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the return of sir john by hearing that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life and of whose elegance 
whose tolerable gentility even she could have no proof 
for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for nothing at all 
they being her relations too trade it so much the worse 
and mrs penning attempt at consolation were therefore unfortunate founded when she advised her daughter not to care about their being so fashionable because they were all cousins and must put up with one another 
as it was in he however now to prevent their coming lady middleton resigned herself to the idea of it with all the philosophy of a well-read woman could 18 sense and sensibility 
treating himself with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject live or six times every day 
the young ladies arrived their appearance wan by no meanungenteel or unfashionable 
their dress was very smart their manners very civil they were delighted with the home and in rapture with the where and they happened to be no doan'ngly fond of children that lady mlddlcton’l good opinion wan engaged in their favour before they had been an hour at the park 
she declared them to be very agreeable girl 
indeed which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration 
sir john’conﬁdence in hit own judgment role with thin animated line and he net of directly for the cottage to tell the its dashwooda of the main select arrival and to nature them of their being the sweetest girl in the world 
from such commendation as this however there wan not much to be learned 
linton well know that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met with in every part of england under every possible varieties of from face temper and understanding 
sir john wanted the whole family to walk to the park directly and look at his gun

it was awful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself 
a do come now a said he 
pray come 
must come 
i declare you shall come you can't ink how you will like them

the children are all hanging about her already an if the wan an old acquainted once 
and they both long to see you of all things for they have heard at execute that you are the most beautiful crcnturcl in the world 
and i have told them it it all very true and a great deal more 
you will be delighted with them l am cure

how can you be to cross at not to come 
why they sense and sensibility 
9 are your mail you know after ten fashion

he could only obtain i promise of their calling at the park within a day or two and then left them in amazement at their indifference to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the miss success as he had been already bang of the miss steeples to them 
when their promised visit to the park and consequent introduction to these young ladies took place by found in the appearance of the eldest who was nearly thirty with a very plain and not a sensible face nothing to admire 
but in the other who was not more than two or three and twenty they acknowledged considerable beauty 
her features were pretty and she had a slop quick eye and s smartness of air which though it did not give actual elegance or grace gave distinction to her person 
their manners were particularly civil and linton soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense when she saw with what constant and judicious attentions they were making themselves agreeable to lady middleton 
with her children they were in continual rupture exalting their beauty courting their notice and humouring all their whims 
and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demand which this politeness made on it was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing if she happened to be doing anything or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight 
fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles a and mother though in pursuit of noise for her children the most precious of human 
age is likewise the most credulous 
her demands are exorbitant 
but she will swallow anything 
and the 120 sense and sensibility 
excessive affection and endurance of the main steepled towards her offspring were viewed therefore by lady middleton without the smallest cuz ride or disarm 
she saw with maternal complacency all the imminent ineronehmenn and mischievous tricks to which her cousin submitted 
she saw their sashes untied their hair pulled about their can their work-bagsearched and their knives and actually stolen away and felt no doubt of in being a reciprocal enjoyment 
it suggested no other surprise than that linton and marriage should sit it completely by without claiming a there in what wan bang

and her mouth stuffed with sugar-plums by the other

she still screamed and snubbed luckily kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her end all their united within were ineffectual till lady middleton luckily renew ring that in a scene of girning distress lem week some prick marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple the same remedy wan eagerly proposed for this unfortunate crutch and a slight intermission of scream in the young lady on hearing it gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected 
she was carried out of the more therefore in her mother arms in quest of this medicine and as the two boys chose to follow though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind the four young indies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours

and i was only afraid the miss dashwoods might and it dull at barton if they had not so many as they used to have 
but perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beauty and had belief be without them as with them 
for my part i think they are vastly a feeble provided they dress smart and behave civil 
ut i can't hear to see them dirty and nasty 
now there s mr rose at extort a prodigious smart young man nice a ban clerk to mr simon you know and yet i you do but method of morning he is not lit to be seen 
i sup see your brother was quite a beau miss dead-wood fore he married as he was so rich in upon my word replied linton i can not tell you for i do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word 
but this i can say that if he ever was as been before he married he is one kill for there is not the smallest alteration in him oh 
dear 
one never thinks of married men's being beam 
they have something else to do 
a lord 
anyone a cried her sister b you can talk of nothing but beau 
— you m ll make miss dead-wood believe you think of nothing else and then to turn the discourse she began admiring the house and furniture 
this specimen of the miss steeples was enough 
the vulgar freedom and fall of the eldest left her no commendations and as blind was not blinded by the 120 sense and sensiihjtvv beauty or the three look of the youngest to her want of mr elegance and anlettnett the left the home without any with of knowing them better 
not to them steeple 
they mine from exerted well provided with admiration for the use of sir john mid eton hit family and all hit relations and no beggarly proportion was now dealt out to hit fair canine whom they declared to be the most bmutiﬁll elegant accomplished and agreeable girl they had ever beheld and with whom they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted 
and to better a minute therefore linton soon found wan their never let lot 
for to sir john will entirely on the tide of the mist smile their puny would be too mang for position and that kind of intimacy must be submitted to which consists of trifling an hour or two together in the tame mum not every day 
sir john could do no more 
but he did not know that any more was required 
to be together wet in hit opinion to estimate and while hit continual scheme for their meeting were effectual he had not a doubt of their being established friends 
to do him justice he did eve thing in hit war to provoke their unreserved by ma in the mist feeler acquainted with whatever he knew or to of his cousin situations in the man delicate palm 
and linton had not seen them more than twice before the eldest of them wished her joy on her titter having been so lucky an to make a conquest of i very man beau since the came to barton 
will be a one thing have her married trying to be sure a aid the hand i hear he it quite a beau and prodigious handsome 
and i hope you may have at good luck yourself too 
but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already linton could not suppose that sir john would be more nice in proclaiming hit opinion of her regard for sense and sensibility 
150 edward than he had been with respect to marian 
indeed it was rather his favourite joe e of the two as being somewhat newer and more can burial and since edward visit they had never dinedletogether without his drinking to her best affections with so much signiﬁeancy and so man nods and winks as to excite general attention 
tie letter f 
had been likewise invariably brought forward and found produce of ouch countless jokes that its character as the wartiest letter in the alphabet had been long established with elixir the miss steeples as she expected had now all the benefit of these jokes and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman alluded to which though often pertinently expressed was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness into the concern their family 
but sir john did not rot long with the curiosity which he dealt hated to raise or he had at least as much pleasure in feel in the name as miss steel had in hearing it 
his name is ferrets a aid he in a very audible whisper 
but pray do not tell it for it a great re a formal 
repeated miss steel 
mr permits is the happy man is he 
what 
your sister-imlsw’s brother 31st dashwoodi a very agreeable young man to be sure 
i know him very well 
d a how can you say so anno 
a cried lucy who generally made an amusement to all her sisters alterations 
though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle it is rather too much in pretend know him ve well 
linton had all this with attention and surprise 
and who was this uncle 
where did he live 
how came they acquainted 
she wished very much to have the subject continued though she did not chose lid sense and sensibility 
to pin in it herself 
but nothing more of it was said an for the first time in her life she thought mrs penning deficient either in curiosity after petty information or in a dis simon to communicate it 
the manner in which in steel had spoken of edward increased her curiosity 
for it struck her as being rather ill-natured and suggested the suspicion of that lady knowing or fancy no herself to know something to his disadvantage 
ut her curiosity wan unavailing for no farther notice was taken of mr ferrari’s name by miss steel when alluded to or even openly mentioned by sir john 
chow all arrange who had never much operations for in like impertinence vulgar interior of parts or even difference of taste am here was at this time particularly indisposed 
from the state of her spirits to be pleased with the miss steeples or to a encourage their advances 
and to the invariable coldness of her behaviour towards them which checked ever endeavour at intimacy on their side elixir principally attributed that preference of herself which soon became evident in the manners of both but especially of lucy who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank communication of her sentiments 
lucy was naturally clever 
her remarks were often just and music 
and as a companion for half an hour elixir frequent y found her agreeable 
but her powers had received no aid from education she was ignorant and illiterate and her deficiency of all mental improvement her want of information in the most common sense and sensible lily 
l 17 particular could not be concealed from mine wood in spite of her constraint endeavour to appear to advantage 
linton un and pitied her for the neglect of qualities which education might have rendered no cable 
but she saw with less tenderer of feeling the thorough want of delicacy of gratitude and integrity of mind which her attention 
her aniduitiee her battered at the park betrayed 
and due could have no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance whose want of inaction prevented their meeting in conversation on terms of equal city and whom conduct towards other made every show of attention and deference toward herself perfectly valueleoa 
b you will think my question an odd one i dare lay laid lucy in her one day as they were walking together from the park to the cottage 
a but play are you personally acquainted with your litter-in-law’l mother my fears i a minor ed think the question a very odd one and her countenance expressed it an the answered that 
she had never seen mr f error 
“indccdl” replied lucy 
i wonder at that for i thought you must have seen her at normandy sometime 
then perhaps you can not tell me what on of a woman she is 
d not a returned elixir caution of giving her real opinion of edward mother and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity 
d i know nothing of her i am lure you think me very strange for inquiring about her in such a way a said lucy eyeing elixir attentively as she spoke 
but perhaps there may be reason 
i wish i might venture 
hut however i hope you will do me the justice of believing that i do not mean to be impertinent 18 sense and sensibility 
linton made her a civil reply and they walked on for a few minutes in silence 
it was broken by lucy who renewed the subject again by saying with some hesitation 
d i can not hear to have-nots think me pertinently curious 
i am sure i would rather do anything in the world than be thought so by a person whose and opinion is so well worth having as ours 
and am sure i should not have the natural est far of turning you indeed i should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such an income noble satan as i am 
but however there is no occasion to trouble you 
i am sorry you do not happen to know mrs ferrets 
d i am sorry i do not a said linton in great astonishment if it could be of any use to m to know my opinion of her 
but really i never understood that on were at all connected with that charily and therefore i an a little surprised i confess at so serious an inquiry into her character i dare say upon are and i am sure i do not at all wonder artist 
ut if i dared tell you all you would not be so much surprised 
mrs ferrets is certainly nothing to me at present 
but the time 10 come 
how soon it will come must depend upon herself 
when we may be very intimately connected 
she looked down as she said this amiable bashful with only one side-glance at her companion to observe its effect on her 
a good heavens 
cried linton a what do mean 
are you acquainted with mr robert fears 
can you be in and she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law 
d no replied lucy not to mr robert fervid 
— i never saw him in my life 
but bring her eyes upon linton c to his elder brother what felt linger at that moment 
astonished 
sense and sensibility 
12th that would have been as full as it was strong had not an immediate dislike of the assertion attended it 
she turned towards lucy in silent amazement unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration 
and though her complexion varied she stood arms in credulity and felt in no danger of an hysterical at or a swoon 
you may well be surprised a continued lucy 
a for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before 
for i dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family 
because it was always meant to be a great secret and i am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour 
not a soul of all my relations know of it but ann and i never should have mentioned it to you if i had not felt the greatest de dance in the world upon your saucy 
and i maliyelhou hit my behaviour in asking so many questions about nigh ferrets must seem so odd that it ought to be explained 
and i do not think mr f error can be displeased when he knows i have trusted you because i know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family and looks upon yourself and the other miss dashwoods quite as his own shanty 
she used 
pallor for a few moments remained silent 
her astonishment at what she heard was at rest too great for words 
but at length forcing herself to speak and to speak cautiously she said with a calmness of manner which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude 
e may i ask if your engagement is of long standing 
a 
we have been engaged these four years 
a four years 
d a up linton though greatly shocked still felt unable to believe it 
i. i 30 sense and sensldllﬂ'y 
i did not know lid she that you were ever acquainted till the other day 
a our acquaintance however it of many years date 
he war under my uncle care you know a confidence while a your uncle 
d a yes 
mr prattle 
did you never hear him talk of mr prattle 
i think i have a lied linton with an exertion of spirit which here with her increase of emotion 
he was four year with my uncle who lives at long-tails near plough 
it was there our acquaintance begun for m time and me was often staying with my uncle an it was there our engagement wan formed though not till a year after he had quitted ii a cupid 
but he was almost always with or afterward 
was ve unwilling to enter into it at you may imagine without the knowledge and approbation of hi mother 
but i win too young and loved him too well to be no prudent at i ought to have hem 
though you do not know him to well a. me mine wood you mun have seen enough of him to be terribly he ll very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him 
certainly a answered linton without knowing what the aid 
but after a moment reflection she added with revived security of edwil‘d’l honour and love and her companion falsehood 
2 engaged to mr edward forrard l 
i confer myself to totally surprised at what you tell me that really 
i beg our pardon 
but purer there must be some mistake of person or name 
we can not mean the name mr fen-nu.” we can mean no other a cried lucy uniting 
mr edward february the eldest none of re fence of park-street and brother of your sister-in-law mr john dead-wood is the person i mean 
you must allow sense 
and sensibility 
3 
thatlunnotlikel wher deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends it is strange replied linton in a most painful perplexity that i should never have heard him even mention your name 
d no 
considering our situation it was not strange 
our first care has been to keep the matter secret 
— you knew nothing of me or my family and therefore there could he no vermin for ever mention my name to you 
and as he was also particularly rid of hi 
sister's suspecting anything but was reason enough for his not mentioning it she was silent 
— linton s security sunk 
but her self-command did not sink with it 
a four years you have been engaged a said she with a warm voice 
a yes 
and heaven know how much longer we may have to wait 
poor edward 
it puts him write out of heart then taking a small miniature from er pocket the added to prevent the possibility of mistake he so good as to look at this face 
it does not do him justice to he mildly but yet i think you can not be deceived as to the person it was drew for 
i have had it above these three years she put it into her hands as she spoke and when linton saw the aiming whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty excitation or her wish of deduction falsehood might sullen to linger in her mind she could have none of its being edward s face 
she returned it almost instantly acknowledge the likeness 
i have never been able d continued lucy to give him my picture in return which i am very much vexed at for he has been always so anxious to get it but i am determined to sit for it the very net portunity.” 4 on are quite in the right 3 replied elixir calmly 
120 sense and shisibiuty 
they then proceeded a few pace in silence 
lucy spoke first 
a 
i am sure a said the i have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping thin secret became you must know of what importance it ll to us not to have it reach liii mother 
for she would never a ve of it i dare say 
i shall have no fortune 
and i fancy she is an exceeding proud woman i certainly did not seek your commence a aid elixir 
a but you do me no more than justice in imagining that i may be depended on 
your seem in safe with me 
but pardon me if i explore some surprise at so unnecessary a communication 
you must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to in safety 
as the said this she looked earnestly at lucy hoping to discover something in her countenance 
perhaps the flood of the great part of what she had been saying 
but lucy s countenance suffered no change 
d i was afraid you would think i wan taking a great liberty with you aid she in telling you all thin 
i have not known you long to be sure really at lent but i have known you and all your amir by drip 
tin a great while 
and as won as i saw ou i felt almost an if you wan an old acquaintance 
guide 
in the present case i really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about edward mother 
and i am so unfortunate that i have not a creature whose advice i can ask 
anyone in the only person that know of it and she he no judgment at all 
indeed she does me a great deal more hannthao good for i am in constant fear of her betraying me 
she does not know how to hold her tongue at you must perceive 
and i am here i was in the greatest fright in the world t other day when edward name was mentioned by sir john lest she should out with it all 
you sure nun sensibility 
31 can't think how much i go through in my mind from it altogether 
i only wonder that i am alive after what i have suffered g edward sake these last four years 
everything in such suspense and uncertainty and seeing him so seldom 
we can hardly meet above twice vicar 
i am sure i wonder my heart is not quite broke 
here she took out her handkerchief 
but linton did not feel very compassionate 
a sometimes a continued lucy after wiping her eyes a i think whether it would not better for us both to break of 
the matter entirely as she said this she looked directly at her companion 
but then at other times i have not resolution enough for it 
i can not bear the thoughts of making him so miserable as i know the very mention of such a thing would do 
and on my own account too 
so dear as he is to me 
i don't think i could be equal to it 
what would gin advise me to do in such a case miss dead-wood 
but would you do yourself 
b c pardon me re lied minor startled by the question 
a but i can give you no advice under such circumstances 
your own judgment must direct you 
c to be sure continued lucy after a cow minutes silence on both sides 9 his mother must provide for him some time or other 
but poor edward it so cast down about it 
did not you think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at barton 
he was so miserable when he left us at constable to go to you that i was afraid you would think him quite ill 
did he come from your uncle then when he visited us 2 d a oh yes 
he had been staying a fortnight with us 
did you think he came directly from town e into a replied elixir most fleeting sensible of every fresh circumstance in favour of luck velocity 
149 sense and sensibility 
i remember he told us that he had been staying a fortnight with some friend near plymouth.” she remembered too her own surprise at the time at his mentioning nothing further of thee friend 
at his total silence with respect even to their names 
did not you think him sadly out of spirits 
repeated lucy 
we did indeed particularly so when he lit arrived 
d i begged him to exert himself for fear you should an t what were the matter 
but it made him no me angrily not being able to may more than a fourth night with us and seeing me to much affected 
poor fellow 
— i am afraid it is just the some with him now 
for he writes in wretched a grin 
i heard from him just before i th exempt 
taking letter from her pocket and calmly showing the direction to linton 
b you know his hand i dare lay a charming one it in 
but that in not written so well as usual 
he was tired i dare say for he had just called the sheet to me as full as possible 
linton saw that it war his hand and oh could doubt no longer 
the picture the had allowed herself to believe might have been accidentally obtained 
it might not have been edward s gift 
but a correspondence between them by letter could subsist only under a positive engagement could be authors by nothing else 
for a few moments the was almost overcome 
her heart sunk within her and she could hardly stand 
but exertion was indispensable necessary and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings that her success was speedy and for the lime complete 
waiting to each other a said lucy returning the letter into her pocket 2 is the only comfort we have in such long separation 
yet i have one other common sense and szrrsmnnv 
150 in his future 
but poor edward has not even low 
if he hath in picture he says he should be easy 
i gave him s co of my hair set in a ring when he was at long-ash last and that was some comfort to him he said but not equal to a picture 
perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him 
d i did a said linton with a cow re of voice under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond anything she had ever felt before 
she was noticed shocked confounded 
fortunately for her they had now reached the cottage and the conversation could be continued no further 
after sitting with them a few minutes the miss steel 
returned to the park and linton was then at liberty to think and be wretched 
chin a 
however small elinor’l general dependence on luck velocity might be it was impossible for her on serious reflections to select it in the present case where no tent lion could be miserable to the folly of inserting a falsehood of such a what lucy had asserted to be true therefore linton could not dared not longer doubt 
supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes 
their opportunity of an acquaintance in the house of mr raft was a foundation or the rest at 
once indispensable and alarming 
and towards vast near plough his melancholy state of mind his dissatisfaction at his own respects his uncertain behaviour towards herself the intimate knowledge of the main steeples as lo ireland and their family connection which had often surmised r 16a sense and sensrnrun’ 
her the picture the letter the ring 
formed altogether such a body of evidence at overcame every fear concerning him unfairly and blinked up a fact which no partiality could net side his ill-treatment of herself 
her resentment of inch behaviour her at having been its dupe for a short time made her feel only for herself 
but other ideal other consideration noon arose 
had edward been intentionally deceiving her 
had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel 
what his engagement to lucy an engagement of the heart 
no 
whatever it might one have been the could not believe it such at present 
his affection was all her own 
she could not be deceived in that 
her mother livers fanny all had been conscious of hi 
regard for her at normandy 
it war not an illusion of her own vanity 
he certainly loved her 
what it softened of the heart was thin permission 
how much could it not tempt her to forgive 
he had been blamable hi holy blamable in remaining at normandy after he first eat her influence over him to be more than it ought to be 
in that he could not lat-defended 
but if he had injured her how much more had he injured himself 
if her case were pitiable his war hopeless 
his imprudence had made her miserable for while 
but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever been otherwise 
she might in time regain tranquillity 
ut in what had he to look forward to 
could he ever be tolerably ha by with lucy steeple 
could he were his affection for herself out of the question with his integrity his delicate and well-informed mind be satisfied with a wife like er 
illiterate after and selfish 
the youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to everything but her beauty and good nature 
but the four succeeding years 
yearn which if rationally spent give such improvement to the understand a 
and sensibility 
3 standing must have opened his eyes to her defects of education while the me period of time spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty 
if in the en position of his seeking to marry herself his difficulties from his mother had seemed great how much greater were they now likely to be when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connection and probably inferior in fortune to herself 
these difficulties indeed with a heart so liberated from lucy might not rest very hard upon his patience 
but melancholy was e state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness could be felt as a relief i as these considerations occurred to her in painful succession she wept for him more than for herself 
supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhasp pines and consoled by the belief that edward h done nothing to forfeit her esteem she thought she could even now under the first smart of the heavy blow command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters 
and so well was she able s answer her own expectations that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes no one would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters that linton was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love and that marian was internally dwelling on the affections of a man of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house 
the necessity of concealing from her mother and marian what had been intrusted in confidence to her 18 samson nun snusnnm-rv 
self though it in her to unceasing exertion 
was no aggravation of eltnor‘s distress 
on the contrary it was a relief to her so be spared the communication of what would give such alllicﬁon to them and to he saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of edward which would probably now from the excess of their partial affection for herself and which was more than she felt equal to support 
from their counsel or their conversation she knew she could receive no assistance 
their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress while her self-command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise 
she was stronger alone and her own good sense so well supported her that her harness was as unshaken her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable as with regrets so poignant and so fresh it was possible for them to be 
much as she had suffered from her first conversation with lucy on the subject she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it and this for more moons than one 
she wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement re hated again she wanted more clearly to understand wi 
lucy really felt for edward whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him and she particularly wanted to convince lucy by her readiness to enter on the matter again and her calmness in converting on it that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend which she very much feared her involuntary action in their morning discourse mun have left at least doubtful 
that lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable 
it was plain that edward had always s spoken highly in her praise not merely from lucy s ambition but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance with a secret so confessed a evidently important 
and even sir johns joking intelligence must sense and sensibility 
19 have had some weight 
but indeed while linton remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by edward it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that lucy should be j our 
and that she was so her very confidence was umf 
what other reason for the disclosure of the a i could there be but that linton i t be informed by it of luck is superior claims on coward and be night to avoid him in future 
she had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival intention and while she was warmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed to combat her own attention for edward and to see him as little as possible 
she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince luck that her heart was announced 
and as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already been told she did not mistrust her own ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure 
but it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could he commanded though lucy was as well disguised as herself to take advantage of any that occurred 
for the weather was not often ne enough to allow of their joining in a walk where they might most easily separate themselves from the other 
and though they met at least every other evening either at the park or come e and chiefly at the former they could not be suppose to meet for the sake of conversation 
such a thought would never enter either sir john or lady middleton s head and therefore very little leisure was ever given for general chat and none at all for particular discourse 
they met for the sake of eating drinking and laughing together playing at cards or consequences or any other game that was sufficiently nous 
one or two meetings of this kind had taken place 40 sense and sensibility 
without according elixir any chance of engaging lucy in private when sir john called at the cottage one morning to beg in the name of charity that they would all dine with lady middleton that day as he was obliged to attend the club at exerted and the would otherwise be quite alone except her mother and the two mist steeple 
linton who forces a fairer opening for the point she had in view in such a party as thin was likely to be more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well-read direction of lady middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose immediately accepted the invitation 
margaret with her mother permission we equally complaints and marian though always unwilling to join any of their parties was subdued by her mother who could not bear to have er delude herself from any chance of amusement to go likewise 
the young ladies went and lady middleton wan happily preserved from the fruit hateful solitude which had threatened her 
the inside it of the meeting wan exactly such as linton had expected 
it produced not one novelty of thought or expression and nothing could he lets interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing-room to the latter the children accompanied them and while they remained there she was too well convinced of the possibility of en raging lucy attention to attempt it 
they quitted it on y with the removal of the tea-things 
the constable was then placed and linton began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of sending time for conversation at the park 
they all rose up in preparation for a round game 
d i am glad said lady middleton to lucy you are not going to wish poor little annamaria’a basket this evening 
for i am sure it must hurt your eye 
to work disagree by candlelight 
and we will make the sense and shsibiuty 
421 dear little love some amends for her disappointment tomorrow and then i hope she will not much mind it

lucy recollected himself instantly and replied a indeed you are very much mistaken lady middleton 
i am only waiting to know whether you can make our party without me or i should have been at my disagree already 
i would not disappoint the little angel for all the world 
and if you want me at the charitable now l am resolved to wish the basket after sup er you are very good 
hope it went hurt your eyes 
will you ring the bell for some working candles 
my poor little girl would be sadly disappointed i know if the basket was not finished to-morrow for though i told her it certainly would not i am sure she depend 
upon having it done lucy directly drew her workvtahle near her and resented herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could my no greater delight than in making a lillngree basket for a point child 
lady middleton proposed a rubber of cousin to the others 
no one made any objection but marian who with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility exclaimed 2 your lady will have the goodness to excuse it

i have not touched it since it was turned and without farther ceremony she turned away and walked to the instrument 
lady middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that ll had never made so rude a h

how could you suppose so

could you have a motive for the trust that was not honourable and lettering to me

i felt sure that you was angry with me

i you knew what a consolation it was no me to relieve my heart by speaking to you of what i am always thinking of every moment of my life your compassion would make you overlook everything else i am sure 
a indeed i can easily believe that it was i very great relief to you to acknowledge your situation to me and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it

lucy here looked up 
but linton wan careful in guarding her countenance from every expectation that could give her word a suspicious tendency

i can safely say that he has never gave me one moment alarm on that account from the mrs. linton hardly knew whether to smile or nigh at assertion 
lucy went on 
d i am rather of a turn too by nature and from our different situation in life 
from his being to much more in the world than me and our continual separation i was enough inclined for museum

or have you none but that of waiting for hira f mars death which is a melancholy and checking extremity 
in her son determined to submit to this and to l the tediousneta of the many years of spent in which it may involve on rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a whiz c by owning the truth 
d if we could be certain that it would he only for a while 
but mrs forrard is a very headstrong proud woman and in her first it of anger upon hearing it would very likely secure everything to robert 
and the idea of that for edward sake frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures 
and for your own take too or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason lucy looked at linton a in and was silent

lucy hit her lip and looked angrily at her time 
a mutual silence took place for some time 
lucy 31st put an end to it by saying in a lower tone though marian was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent concert 
i will honestly tell on of one income which hat lately come into my head for bringing matter to bear 
indeed i am bound to let you into the secret for you are a party concerned 
i dare say you have seen enough of edward to know that he would refer the church to every other profusion 
now my p an in that he should take orders as noon at he can and then through your interest which i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him and i hope out of come regard to me your brother i t be persuaded to give him normandy living 
which gal understand it a very good one and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while 
that would be enough for us to marry upon a and we might trust to time and chance for the rest i should be always happy e lied linton to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for mr ferry 
but do not a perceive that my interest on such an occasion woull‘l0 be perfectly unneoeuary.’ he in brother to mrs john dashed

at length lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh 
d i believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement 
we seem so best with difficulties on every side that though it would make us miserable for a time we should be happier perhaps in the end 
but you will not give me your advice miss dead-wood 
not a answered linton with a smile which concealed ve agitated feeling on such a subject i certainly will not 
you know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you unless it were on the side of your wishes 
indeed you wrong me a replied lucy with great solemnity 
i know nobody of whose judgment i think so highly as i do of yours 
and do really believe that if you was to say to me a i advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with edward farms it will be more for the happiness of both of you d i should resolve upon doing it immediately 
linton blushed for the insincerity of edward future wife and re li a this compliment would effectually fro hate me morn giving any opinion on the subject had i formed one 
it raises my innocence much too high 
the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for in indignant person 
t is because you are an indifferent person said lucy with some unique and laying a particular area on those words 2 that your judgment might just 
have arch weight with me 
if you could he so to be passed in on re in your own feeling r none would not beywo‘rlihmhazing.” 3 you up 
linton thought it wisest to make no answer in this 18 son and smsrmrrv

it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there 
but i dare nay you will go for all that 
to be one your brother and litter will at you to come to them

how unlucky that in 
i had quite depended upon meeting you there 
anyone and me are to go the latter and of january to tame relations who have been wanting us to visit them there several an 
but i only go for the sake of seeing edgar he will be there in february 
otherwise london would have no charmed me i have not spirit for it linton was soon called to the creditable h the conclusion of the list robber and the confidential discourse of the two ladies wan therefore at an end 
to which both of them submitted without any reluctance for nothing had been said on either title to make them unlike each other less than they had done before 
and linton not down to the creditable with the melancholy petition that edward was not only without affection for the person who was to he his wife but that he had not even the chance of being tolerant hasp y in marriage which sincere affection on m tide would have given for self-interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement of which the seemed so thoroughly aware that he war weary 
sense and sensibility 
149 from this time the subject was never revived by linton 
and when entered on by lucy who seldom missed an open rotundity of introducing it and was particularly care us to inform her confidant of her ha incense whenever she received a letter from ed it was treated by the former with calmness and caution and dismissed as soon as civility would allow 
for she felt much conversations to be an indulgence which lucy did not deserve and which were dangerous to herself 
the visit of the miss steeples at barton park was lengthened far beyond what the em invitation implied 
their favour increased they could not be spared 
sir john would not hear of their going 
and in ten of their numerous and long-arranged engagements in water in it of the absolute necessity of their returning to fulfil them immediately which was in full force at the end of every week they were prevailed on to stay nearly two months at the park and to assist in the due elevation of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private balls and large dinner to proclaim its importance 
chapter 19 
though mrs penning was in the habit of spending a large notion of the year at the houses of her child dree and friends she was not without a settled habitation of her own 
since the death of her husband who had traded with succeed in a less elegant part of the town she had resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near portmanuare 
towards this home she began on the approach of january to turn her thoughts and thither she one day abruptly and very unexpectedly by them naked the 150 sense and sensibility 
elder minx dalhwooda to accompany her 
linton without observing the varying complexion of her litter and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the lane immediate gave a grateful but absolute denial for th in which she believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations 
the rent lodge was their determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of year 
man leaning received the refusal with some so lull and repeated her invitation immediately 
150 lord 
i am sure your mother can spare you very well and i do beg you will favour me with your company for love quite set 
my heart upon it 
don't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me for i sha n't put myself at all out 
of my way for you 
it will only be uendmgrbetty by the coach and i hope i an afford bar 
e three shall be able to go very well in my chaise 
and when we are in town if you do not like to go wherever i do well and good you may always go with one of my day ben 
i am sure your mother will not object to it 
or i have had such good luck in getting my own children of 
my hands that the will think me a very lit pen to have the charge of you and if i do n't get one of you at lean well married before i have done with you it shall not be my fault 
i shall speak a good word for you to all the young men you may depend uz n it 
i have a moon a laid sir john that minx marriage would not object to such a scheme if her elder sister would come into it 
it in very hard indeed that 
she should not have a little pleasure became main dead-wood does not 
wish it 
so i would advise you two to set of for town when on are tired of barton without saying a word to manhood about it 
3 nay cried my penning i am sure i shall be monstrous glad of miss marian s company whether mine dashed will go or not only the more dusters an d sensibility 
i s i merrier say i and i thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together 
because if they got tired of me th might talk to one another and laugh at my odd ways hind my back 
but one or the other if not both of them i must have 
lord bless me how do you think i can live poking by myself i who lave been always used till this winter to have chariot with me 
come miss marian let us strike lands upon the bargain and if miss dashed will change her mind by-and-bye why so much the better 
i thank you ma'am sincerely thank you said marian with warmth 
a our invitation has insured my gratitude for ever an it would give me such ha press 
yes almost the greatest happiness i am capable c of to be able to accept it 
but my mother my dearest kindest mother 
— i feel the justice of what linton has urged and if she were to be made less happy less comfortable by our absence 
oh l no not me should tempt me to leave her 
it should not must not be a struggle 
mrs penning repeated her assume that my dashed could spare them perfectly well 
and linton who now understood her sister and saw to what indifference to almost everything else she was carried by her eagerness to be with ploughboy again made no farther direct opposition to the plan and merely referred it to her mother decision from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to vent a visit which she you d not approve of for anyone and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid 
whatever marian was desirous of her mother would be eager to provoke 
she could not expect to influence the latter to incautiousness of conduct in an air respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust and she dared not ax on the motive of her own disinclination for going to london

you have been beating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you there in all one objection which in my opinion can not be to until remove 
billarianne s countenance lurk 
e and what a said mrs dashed in my dear pendent elixir going to suggest 
what formidable obstacle in she now to bring forward 
do not let me hear a word about the expense of it a my objection is thin though i think very well of my penning heart she in not a woman whoa can afford a pleasure or whole protection will give in can hence 
hat in very true a replied her mother 
but of her society separated from that of other people you will scarcely have anything at all and on will almost always appear in public with lady i eton d if e nor in frightened away by her dislike of my penning d said marian at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation 
i have no inch temples and i am sure i could ut up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little egdon 
linton could not help smiling at this display of difference towards the manner of a person to whom oh 
had often had difficulty in persuading marines to behave with tolerable politeness and resolved within herself 
that if her sister perched in going she would go likewise a 
she did not think it proper that marriage should be left the sole guidance of her own judgment or that mrs join a should be abandoned to the mercy of marian for all the comfort of her domestic home 
to this determination the was the more pain reconciled by recollecting that edward f enhance by lucy account 
was not to be in town before february and that their visit without any unreasonable abridge might be previously gnashed 
149 sense and slnslblllty 
i will have you m go d if mrs dead-wood 
a these objections are nonsensical 
you will have much pleasure in being in london and especially in being together 
and if linton would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment she would foresee it there from a variety of sources 
she would perhaps expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister-in-law s family 
linton had often wished for an opposite of attempting to weaken her mother dependence on the attachment of edward and herself that the shock might be the less when the whole truth were revealed and now on this attack though almost hopeless of success she forced herself to begin her design by saying as calmly as she could i like edward fears very much and shall always be glad to see him 
but as to the rest of the family it is a matter of fact indifference to me whether i am ever known to t em or not mrs. dashed smiled and said nothing 
marian lifted up her eyes in astonishment and linton conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue after very little farther discourse it was finally settled that the invitation should be fully accepted 
mrs penning received the information with a great deal of joy and many assurances of kindness and care 
nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her 
sir john was delighted 
for to a man whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of being alone the acquisition of two to the number of inhabitants in london was something 
even lady middleton took the trouble of being delighted which was putting herself rather out of her way 
and as for the miss steeples especially lucy they had never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence made them 
linton submitted to the arrangement which counter-acted her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected to feel 
with regard to herself it was now a sense and sensibility 
s s matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not 
and when due saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the klan and her sister exhilarated by it in look voice an manner restored to all her usual animation and elevated to more than her usual gaiety the could not be dissatisfied with the cause and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence 
marian's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness no great was the perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone 
her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness 
and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive 
her mother affection was hardly less and linton was the only one of the three who seemed to consider the reparation as anything short of eternal 
their departure took place in the first week in january 
the middleton were to follow in about a week 
the miss steeples kept their station at the park and were to quit it only with the rest of the family 
better 4th 
t e nor could not and herself in the carriage with mrs penning and beginning a oumeyto london under her protection and as er guest without wondering at her own situation so short had their acquaintance with that lady been 
so wholly insulted were they in age and disposition and so many had been her objections against such a measure only a few days before i but these objection had all with that ha window of youth which marian and her mother quill 
shared been overcome or overlooked 
and linton in spite of every occasional doubt of will by constancy could not witness the rapture of delightful exert 60 s all ssnsraltrrv 
recitation which filled the whole soul and barred in the eyes marian without feeling how blank was her own prospect how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison and how gladly she would engage in the solitude of msrianne’s situation to have the lame animating object in view the urn possibility of hope 
a short a very than time however must now dead what willoughhy’s intentions were in all probability he was already in town 
marian's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on sending him there 
and linton was resolved not only upon gaining every 
new light as to his character which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention as to ascertain what he was and what he meant before many meetings had taken place 
should the result of her observations he unfavourable she was determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister 
should it be otherwise her exertions would he of a different nature 
she must then learn to avoid every splash comparison and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of marian 
they were three days on their journey and marian's behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what her future complaints and companionableness to mrs penning might be expected to be 
she sat in silence almost all the way wrapt in her own meditations and scarcely ever voluntarily speaking except when any object of picturesque beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively addressed to her sister 
to atone for this conduct 
therefore linton took immediate possession of the of civility which she had assigned herself behaved with the greatest attention to mrs penning talked with her laughed with her and listened to her whenever she could 
and mrs evenings on her side treated them both sense and sensibility 
150 with all possible kindness was solicitors on eve son for their ease and enjoyment and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their own dinners at the inn nor extort a confession of their referring salmon to cod or boiled fowls to veil cutlass 
reached town by three o'clock the third day glad to be released after such a journey from the confinement of 
carriage and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good re 
the house wan handsome and handsomely fitted up and the young ladies were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment 
it had formerly been charlotte’s and over the mantelpiece still hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect 
as dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their arrival elixir determined to employ the interval in waiting to her mother and sat down for that purpose 
in a new moments marian did the same 
i am writing home marian d said linton 
had not you better defer your letter for a day or two 2 d i am not going to write to my mother a replied marian hastily and as if wishing to avoid an farther inquiry 
linton said no more 
it immediately muck her that she must then be writing to willoughby and the conclusion which as instantly followed was that however mysteriously they might winds to conduct the affair th must be engaged 
this conviction though not entire y satisfactory gave her pleasure and she continued her letter with greater alacrity 
marines was finished in a very few minutes 
in length it could be no more than a note it was then folded up sealed in directed with eager aridity 
linton thought she could distinguish a large in the direction and no sooner was it complete then msriunne ringing the hell 
rest sense and sbnslblllty 
quitted the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed for her to the penny post 
this decided the matter at once 
her spirits still continued very high but there was a butter in them which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister and this agitation accused as the evening drew on 
she could scarcely eat any dinner and when they afterwards returned to the drawing-room seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carnage 
it was a great satisfaction to linton that mrs penning by being much engaged in her own room could see little of what was passing 
the ten things were brought in and already had marian been disappointed more than once by a us at a neighbouring door when a loud one was sudden y heard which could out be mistaken for one at an other house 
linton felt secure of its announcing ploughboy s approach and marian starting up moved towards the door 
everything was silent 
this could not be borne many seconds she opened the door advanced a few steps towards the stairs and after listening half a minute returned into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce 
in the excess of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming to linton it is willoughhy indeed it is 
e and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms when colonel grandson a red 
it was too great a shock to be borne wixteaoslmness and she immediately left the room 
linton was isa pointed too 
but at the same time her regard for colonel grandson insured his welcome with her and she felt regularly hurt that a man partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him 
she instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him that he even observed sense 
and sensibility 
149 marian so she quitted the room with such punishment and concern as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself 
is your sister ill 
a said he 
linton answer in some distress that she was end then talked of headache low-spirited and over-fatigues 
and of everything to which she could decently attribute her sister s behaviour 
he heard her with the most earnest mention but seeming to recollect himself said no more on the subject and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in london making the usual in dairies about their journey and the friends they had left he rind 
in this calm kind of way with very little intent on either side they continued to talk both of them out of s rifts and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere 
linton wished very much to ask whether willoughby were then in town but she was afraid of giving him by any inquiry after his rival 
and at length by way of saying something she asked if he had been in london ever since she had seen him last 
yes 3 he re lied with some embarrassment a almost ever since 
i have been once or twice at eyford for a few days but it has never been in my power to return to barton 
this and the manner in which it was said immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place with the business and suspicions they had caused to mrs. penning and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt 
mrs penning soon came in 
150 colonel 
said she with her usual noisy cheerfulness a i am monstrous glad to see you 
sorry i could not come before 
beg yougardon but 
i have been forced to look about me s li e and settle my matters

well colonel i have brought two young ladies with me you dog 
till it you see but one of them now but there in another somewhere

i was young once but i never wan very handsome wane luck for me 
however i got a very good husband and i don't know what the grated beauty do more 
ah 
poor man 
he hatbeendead these eight years and better 
but colonel where have you been to since we parted 
and how does your business go on 
come come let i have no secrets among friends he replied with his accustomed mildness to all her inquiries but without satisfying her in any 
linton now began to make the tea 
and marian vale obliged to appear again 
after her entrance colonel grandson became more thoughtful and silent than he had been before and 
joining could not prevail on him to my long 
no other visitor appeared that evening and the lathe were unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed sense and sensibility 
6d 
marian rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks 
the disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the expectation of what wan to he that day 
they had not long finished their h before mrs palmer borough stopped the door and in a few minutes she came laughing into the room 
to delighted to see them all that it was hard to any whether she received most pleasure from meeting her mother or the miss woods again 
so surprised at their coming to town though it was what she had neither expected along 
so angry at their accepting her mother invitation after having declined her own though it the same time she would never have forgiven them if they had not come 
a mr palmer will be so 1801 my to see you a aid the

a after an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat or in other words in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on in jennings’s side and in laughter without candle on my palmer it was proposed by the latter that they should i all accompany her to some shops where she had busineuthnt coming to which my penning and linton readily contented as having likewise some purchases to make theme 
and a one though declining it at first was induced to go likewise 
wherever they went she won evidently many on the watch 
in bradstreet especially where much of their business lay her eyes were in contact inquiry 
and in whatever shop the party were engaged her mind w equally abstracted from everything actually before them from all that interested and occupied the other 
restless and dissatisfied everywhere her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase however it i. l 16a sense and sensibility 
might equally concern them both 
the received no pleasure from anything 
was only impatient to he at home again and could with direct my given her vexation at the seriousness of palmer whose eye was caught by everything pretty expensive or new 
who was wild to buy all could determine on none and ducked away her time in rapture and indecision 
it was late in the morning before they returned home 
and no sooner had they entered the house than radiance dew eagerly upstairs and when linton followed the found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance which declared that no willoughhy had been there 
a has no letter been left here for me since we went out 9 d said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels

6d mr palmer and two elderly adieu my mind e intimate acquaintance whom the had met and iv in the morning dined with them 
the former left them soon after tea to fulfil her evening engagement

as she would never learn the game 
but though her time was therefore at her own disposal the evening wan by no man more produce of place to her dun to linton for it was spent in all the axle of expect lion and the air of din ointment

for although archer settled in town sir john had contrived to collect around him nearly twenty young leg and to amuse them with a ball 
this won an r however of which lady middleton did not approve 
in the country an unpremeditated dance was very lovable 
but in london 
where the reputation of elegance was more important and less canine obtained it was milking too much for the gratification of a few girls to have it known that lady middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple with two villains and a mere sideboard collection

and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after hreakﬁwl on the marrow that marian who again writing to willoughby for the could not pursue it to he to any other pen 
bout the middle of the day my penning went out b herself on hunting and linton began her letter directly 
while marriage too reader employment too anxious for conversation walked from one window to the other or sat down by the free in melancholy meditation

they had not remained in this manner long before linton perceived willoughby standing within a few yards of them in earnest conversation with a very fashionable-looking young woman 
she soon caught his eye and he immediately bowed but without attempting to freak to her or to approach marian though he co d not but see her 
and then continued hi discourse with the lame lady 
linton turned involuntarily to marriage to ice whether it could be unobserved by her

linton was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address and was unable to say a word 
but the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed 
her face was poisoned over and she exclaimed in i voice of the greatest emotion good god l willoughby what is the meaning of this 
have you not received my letters 
will you not shake hands with me 
he could not then avoid it but her touch seemed painful to him and he held her hand only for a moment 
using ill this time he was evidently struggling for composure 
linton watched his countenance and saw its expression becoming more tranquil

his complexion changed and all his embarrassment returned 
but as if on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking he felt the necessity of instant exertion he recovered himself again and after saying a yes i had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town which you were so as to send to me turned hastily sway with a right how and joined his friend

the loft of desperate calmness with which thin was mid lasted no longer than while she spoke and wan immediately followed by a return of the lame excessive affection 
it was some minutes before the could go on with her letter and the frequent hum of grief which still obliged her at intervals to withhold her pen were proof enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that the was writing for the last time to willoughby 
linton paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power 
and they would have tried to soothe and tranquillized her still more had not marian entreated her with all the eaters of the most nervous irritability not no speak to her for the world

linton drew near but without saying a word 
and seating herself on the bed took her hand kissed her affectionately several times and then gave way to a burst of tea which at em was scarcely less violent than marian's 
the latter though unable to speak seemed to feel all the tendency of this behaviour and after some time thus spent in joint affliction she put all the letter 
into sons and sensibility

and then covering her face with her handkerchief almost screamed with agony

but it never was sense and sensibility 
ii year you wrote to him 
yes 
could that belong eternal tharhndpaued 
but i can not talk 
linton said no more and turning again to the three letterwhich now raised much stronger curiosity than before directly ran over the contents of all 
the list which war what her either had rent hira on their arrival in town war to this effect 
bankers sundry january

but could it he no 
you inner be very much all indeed since we parted if that could be the cane and you not there

but i will not suppose this possible and i hope very 
soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise 
m. d 
the contents of her last note to him were these 
what am i to imagine willoughby by your behaviour last night 
again i demand an explanation of it 
i was prepared to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally produced with the familiarity which our intimacy at barton a so me to justify 
l was repulsed indeed 
have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse in conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting 
but though i have not yet been able to form an reasonable apology for your behaviour i am perfectly read to hear our justification of it 
you have perhaps missing erred or purpose deceived in something concerning me which may have lowered me in your opinion 
tell me what it is explain the grounds on which you acted and i shall be satiated in being able to satisfy you 
it would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill of you 
but i am too it if am to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed on that your regard for us all was sincere that your behaviour to me was intended on to deceive let it be sold as soon as possible 
my fee kings are at present in a state of dreadful indecision 
i wish to acquit you but certainty on either side will be ease to what i now suffer 
if your sentiments are no longer what they were you will return my notes and the lock of my hair which is in your possession 
m. d 
that such letters so full of affection and conscience could have been so answered linton for willoughby’s eke 
would have been unwilling to believe 
but her condemnation of him did not find her to the impotence and sensibility 
3 propriety of their having been written at all 
and he was silently grieving over the impotence which had handed lock solicited roof of tenderness not warranted by anything preceding and most severely condemned by the event when marian perceiving that the had finished the letters observed to her that they contained nothing but what any one would have written in the lame situation 
i felt if added to he an element engaged him themicteet legal covenant had and to each other 
l can believe it a said linton 
a but unfortunately he did not feel the name a he d feel the lane elixir 
for week and weeks he felt it 
i know he did 
whatever may have changed him now and nothing but the blackest an employed against me can have done it 
l was once as dear to him a my own soul could with 
this lock of hair which now he can so readily give up was begged me with the most earnest supplication 
had you seen his look his manner had you heard his voice at that moment have you for at the last evening of our being there at barton 
the morning that we limited too 
en he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again-«hie distress 
can i ever to at his dimes 2 for a moment or two she c d say no more 
but when thin emotion had passed away she added in a former tone 
a linton i have been cruelly used but not by willowy 
dearest marian who but himself 
by whom can he have been initiated 
b c by all the world rather than by hi own heart 
i could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance a league together to ruin me in his opinion than believe his nature capable of such cruelty 
thin woman of 4 sense and sensibility 
whom he writes 
whoever the be 
or any one in short but your own dear of common and edward may have been 10 barbarous to belie me 
beyond in three in there a creature in the world whom would not rather infection of evil than willoughhy whoa heart i know no we 
linton would not contend and only replied a whoever may have been to detestably your enemy let them be cheated of their malignant triumph my dear linger by seeing how noble the contciauaneae of your own innocence and good intentions upon your rpirita.‘ it in a reasonable and lovable pride which rests ouch malevolence 
d no no a cried marian a minor inch as mine ha no pride 
i care not who know that i am wretched 
the triumph of seeing me of may be open to all the world 
liquor linton they who suffer little may be proud and in bent on they like 
ma mint insult or return monk caution 
hut i can not 
nut feel 
i must be wretched 
and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can a but for my mother sake and mine 
a d i would do more than for my own 
but to appear varry when i am so miserable 
— old who can require it 
a again they were both silent 
linton wan employed in walking thoughtfully from the free to the window from the window to the free without knowing that the received warmth from one or discerning objects through the other 
and marian seated at the foot of the bed with her head leaning against one of it tom again took up willoughby’t letter and after shuddering over every r sentence exclaimed 
— 
it in too much i o willoughby willoughby could thin be yours 
cruel cruel 
nothing can acquit you 
linton nothing can 
whatever he might have sense and sensibility 
25 heard against nave 
ought he not to have suspended his belief 
ought he not to have told profit to have given me the power clearing myself 
the lock of hair repeating it from the letter which you it obliging bedewed on me 2 that in pardonable

it would be impossible to go to-morrow 
we owe mrs penning much more than civility 
and civility of the commonest kind mun prevent ouch a hasty removal us that 
well then another day or to perhaps 
but i cannut my here 10 i can not my to endure the question and remark of these pie

oh i what would be i to that 
nor advised her to lie down again and for a moment she did 10 
but no attitude could give her cub 26 sense and swsruru’rv 
and in rattle pain of mind and body the mud from one posture to another till growing more and more hysterical her litter could with difficulty keen her on the bed at all and for name time wan fearful of being constrained to call for admittance 
some avenger drops however which the was at length persuaded to take were of use 
and from that time till man leaning 
returned the continued on the bed quiet and motionless 
hum was 
mrs penning came immediately to their room on her return and without waiting to have her request of admittance answered opened the door and walked in with a look of real concern 
a how do you do m dear 
a said she in a voice of great companion to rann who turned away her face without attempt thing to answer 
a how in she in dead-wood 
poor thing 
the look very bad 
no wonder 
ay it is but too true 
he ll to be married very noon 
a good-for-nothing fellow 
i have no patience with him 
my taylor told me of it half an hour ago and the was told it by a particular friend of mist grey herself else i am sure i should not have believed it 
and i was almost ready to link a it wan 
well said i all i can lay in that 
if it is true he has used a young lad of my acquaintance abornimbly ill and i wish with my soul his wife my plague hell heart out 
and so i shall always lay my dear you may depend on it 
i have no notion of mental going on in this way 
and if ever i meet him again i will give him such a dressing as he has not had thin many a day 
but there ii one comfort my dear mid marian 
he in not the only young man in the world sense and sensibility 
27 worth having 
and with your pretty face you will never want admirers 
well poor thing 
i want disturb her my longer for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with it 
the carrying ssndersans luckily are coming to-night you know and that will amuse her 
she then went away walking on i toe out of the room as if she so passed her young rends sillictiou could be increased y noise 
v marines to the rise of her sister determined on diningwith them 
nor even advised her against it 
but a no she would go down r she could bear it very well and the bustle about her would be less elixir pleased to have her governed flora moment by such a motive though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner said no more 
and autumn hardness for hers well as she could while marian remained on the bed was ready to assist her into the dining-room up soon as they were summoned to it 
when there though looking most wretchedly she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected 
had she tried to speak or had she been conscious of half mrs penning s s welldneant but ill-judged attentions to her this firmness could not have been maintained 
but not a syllable escaped her lips and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of everything that as using before her 
e nor who did justice to mrs jennings’s kindness though its effusions were often distressing and sometimes almost ridiculous made her those acknowledgment 
and returned her those civilities 
which her sister could not make or return for herself 
their good friend saw that 
marian was unhappy and felt that everything was due to her which might make her at all less so 
she treated her therefore with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of its 88 sense and sensibility 
holidays 
marian was to have the best place by the fire watson betemptedto eat hyeverydeliucyin the house and to be unused by the relation of ell the news of the day 
had not linton in the sad countenance of her sister seen a check all mirth she could have been entertained by mrs penning s endeavours to cure 3 appointment in love 
by s variety of twelve and o hives and a good fire 
as noon however no the consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on marian she could stay no longer 
with an hasty exclamation of misery an a sign to her sister not to follow her she directly got up and hurried out of the room 
a poor soul l 
cried my penning as soon as she was gone a how it grieve me to see her 
and i declare if the is not gone away without snivelling her winter and the dried berries too 
lord 
nothing seems to do her any good 
i am sure if i knew of anything she would like i would send all over the town for it 
well it is the odd thing to me that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill 
but when there is plenty of money on one side and next to none on the other lord bless you 
there no more about such thing 10 
4 the lady then 
mist grey i think you called her 
— is very rich 
a fifty thousand pounds my dear 
did you ever see her 
a smart girlish girl the lay but not handsome 
i remember her aunt very well bid openshaw 
the married a very wealthy man 
but the family are all rich together 
fifty thousand pounds 
and by all accounts it went come before it is wanted 
for they say he is all to pieces 
no wonder 
dashing about with his carriage and hunger 
well it done at if talking 
but when i young man be he who he will comes and makes love to a pretty girl and promises marriage he has no business to my off from his word only brute sense and sensibility

found at the expected in her own room leaning in silent misery over the small remains of a tree which till elinor’e entrance had been heron eight 
you had better leave me a was all the notice that her litter received from her 
d i will leave you d said linton if you will go to bed but this from the momentary pervenenen of impatient murdering the at first refund to do 
her bitter earnest though gentle 
persuasion however moon offered her to compliance and linton saw her lay her aching head on the pillow and now her an the hoped in a way to get tome quiet rat before the left her 
in the drawing-room whither the then repaired the was soon joined by my penning with wine-glue full of something in her hand 
a my dear laid the entering i have just recollect that i have some of the nest old constantly wine in the home that ever wetted 
too i have brought a glad of it for your litter 
my poor husband how fond he was of it 
whenever he had a touch of hit old colicky gout he laid it did him more good than anything joe in the world 
do take it to your linen dear madam replied linton smiling at the difference of the company for which it was recommended how good you are 
but i have just left lausanne in bed and i hope almost asleep 
and up i think sense arm sbnsibhjty

and linton at the followed the chief of it reflected that thou h in good effect on a cholickygout were at peter s little importance to her in poverty on a disappointed hem might be at reasonably tried on herself at on her time 
colonel grandson came in while the were at tea and by hit manner of looking round room for marriage elixir immediate fancied that he neither expected nor wished to ice her there and in than that he was already aware of what occurred her absence 
mrs penning wet not struck by the tame thought 
for noon after hit entrance the walked wrote the room to the temple where elixir provided and whispered 
the colonel look at grave at ever you tree 
he knows nothing of it 
do tell him my dear 
he shortly afterward drew a chair close to here and with a look which perfectly assured her of hit good information enquired after her aim 
a mariner it not well a said the 
d she hat been wander andwehavepertuaded heroism perhaps then he hesitatingly replied that i heard this morning run he true

quedoknowittl thitteelntrohtvebeen i ii 
c 104 sense and sensibility 
day of general education for this very morning 31st unfolded it to in 
mr willoughby is unfathomable 
where did you hear it 
a in a stationary shop in pall mall where i bad business 
two ladies were waiting for their carriage and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match in a voice so little attempting concealment that it was impossible for me not to hear all 
the name of willoughhy john willaughby fervently repeated link caught my attention and what to owed was a positive assertion that everything was now nelly settled respecting his marriage with miss c 
it was no longer to be a secret 
it would take r 
face even within a few weeks with many particulars of p don and other matters 
one thing especially 
remember because it served to identify the man still more 
— as soon as the ceremony was over they were to go to combe magnet his seat in somenetehire 
my astonishment 
but it would be impossible to describe what i felt 
the communicative lady i learnt an inquiry for i said in the shop till they were gone was a mrs elusion and that as i have been since informed is the name of miss greys guardian c it is 
but have you likewise heard that miss grey has fifty thousand pounds in that if in anything we may 2nd an explanation 
a it may be so 
hut willoughby is capable 
at least i think 
— he stopped a moment 
then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself a and your sister how did sheaf 7 her sufferings have been very severe 
i have only to hope that they my be proportionably short 
it has been it it a most cruel affliction 
till yesterday i believe she never doubted his regard 
and even now perhaps 
but i am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her 
he has been very deceitful 
sense and six 1500 and in some points there seems a hardness heart about him 
ah i d said colonel grandson a there is indeed 
but your sister does not 
i think you said so 
she does not consider it quite as you do in a you know her disposition and may believe how a curly she would still justify him if she could 
e made no answer 
and soon afterwards by the removal of the tea things and the arrangement of the card the subject was necessarily mrs penning who had watched them with pleasure while the were talking and who expected to see the effect of its dashwood’s communication in such an instantaneous gaiety on colonel abandons side as might have become a man in the bloom of youth of hope and happiness saw him with amazement remain the whole evening more serious and thoughtful than usual 
«eb-9m s room i night of more sleep than she had expected f marian awoke the next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had closed her eyes 
linton encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt 
and before breakfast was ready they had gone through the subject again and again 
with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on elinor‘s side the same impetus feelings and varying opinions on marian's as before 
sometimes she could believe willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself and at others lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquainting him 
at one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all 16a sense and sensibility 
the world it mother she would delude herself from it for ever and at a third could resist it with energy 
in one thing however she was uniform when it come to the point in avoiding where it was possible the presence of mrs penning and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it 
her heart was hardened against the belief of mrs jennings’s entering into her sorrows with any compassion 
d no no no it can not be a she cried 
she can not feel 
her kindness is not sympathy 
her good-natured is not tenderness 
all that she wants is gossip and she only likes me now because i supply it linton had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others by the irritable refinement of her own mind and the too great importance placed by her on the delicacy of a strong sensibility and the graces of a polished manner 
like half the rest of the world if more than half there be that are clever and good marian with excellent ability and an excellent disposition was neither reasonable nor candid 
she expected from other place the name opinions and feelings as her own and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself 
thus a circumstance occurred while the sisters were together in their own room after bmaltfatt which sunk the heart of mrs penning still lower in her estimating 
because through her own weakness it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself though mrs penning was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost good-will 
with a letter in her outstretched hand and countenance gaily smiling from the persuasion of bringing comfort she entered their room saying 
— a now my dear i bring you something that i am sure will do you good 
marian heard enough 
in one moment her images and srnsxbilh'y 
3 inaction placed before her a letter from will by full of tender and contrition explanation of a that had satisfactory convincing 
and instantly followed willoughb herself rushing eagerly into the room to force at her feet by the offence of hit eyed the trance of his letter 
the work of one moment was employed by the next 
the handwriting of her mother never till then unwelcome wan before her 
and in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an excess of more than one the felt as if till that instant the had never suffered 
the cruelty of mrs penning no language within her reach in her moment of happiest eloquence could have expressed 
and now the could reproach her only by the tent which streamed from her eyes with passionate violence 
a knock however 10 entirely lost on its object that r many expression of pity the withdrew still referring her to the letter for comfort 
but the letter when the was calm enough to read it broke het little comfort 
willoughby called every page 
er mother still contents of her engagement and lying a warmly at ever on his constancy had only been routed by elinor’t application to content from nine greater openness toward them both and thin with such tenderness toward her such affection for willoughby and each a conviction of their future happiness in each other that the wept with agony through the whole of it 
all her impatience m be at home again now returned 
her mother wan dearer to her than ever 
dearer through the very excess of her mistake confidence in willowy and he was wildly urgent to be gone 
linton nab e herself to determine whether it were bear for marriage to be in london or at barton offered no counsel of her own excess of patience till their mother s wieheeeauld could be now 
and at length the obtained her sisters content to wait for that knowledge 
3 sense and sensibility 
man leaning left them earlier than none 
for die cmrldnotbeeuytillthemiddletom and palmeriwere able to grieve in much an herself and positive rending elinor’e offered attendance went out alone for the rent of the morning 
linton with a very heavy heart aware of the in the will going to communicate and perceiving by annexed letter how ill the had proceeded in laying any foundation for it then eat down to write her mother an account of what had pained and interest her direction for the future 
while marian who came into the drawing-room on my jenninga’l going away remained vexed at the table where elixir wrote watching the advancement of her pen grieving over her for the hardship of inch a task and grieving mill more fondly over its effect on her mother 
in thin manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour when marian whose nerve could not then bear any sudden noise war startled by a rap at the door 
a who can this be 
a cried linton 
a so early too 
i thought we bad been chafe marian moved to the window 
a it is colonel brandy 10 d said the with vexation 
2 we are never safe from liar 
a he will not come in as mrs penning it from home a i will not me to bear retreating to her own room 
d a man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of other 
the event proved her conjecture right though it was founded on injustice and error for colonel grandson did come in 
and linton who was convinced that solitude for marriage brought him thither and who raw bat solitude in hit disturbed and melancholy look and in hit anxious though brief inquiry after her could not forgive her sister for entering him an lightly 
sense and sensibility 
9 d i met my joining in bond street a laid he offer the list caution and oh encouraged me to come on 
and i was the more easily encouraged became i thought it probable that i might and you alone which i was very dim 
of doing

mill you low me to prove it by relating some circumstances which nothing but a on sincere regard 
nothing but an ornament desire of being useful 
i think i am justiﬁedé-though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that i am right in there not name reason to fear i may be wrong 2 
he stopped 
d i understand you d said linton 
b you have something to tell me of mr willoughby that will open hit character farther 
your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shown ho marian 
my gratitude will be insured immediately by any infornuﬁon tending to that end and be must be gained by it in time 
pray my let me hear it 
you half 
and to be brief when i quitted barton last october 
but this will give you no idea

you will and me a very awkward narrator mill touchwood 
i hardly know where to begin 
a about account of m if i believe will be necessary and it do be s as one 
on nah a subject sighing heavily i can have little temptation to be disperse 
he stopped a moment for recollection and then with another nigh went on 
b you have probably entirely forgotten a conversation 
it i. not to be supposed that it could make any impend on you 
no conversation between us one no sense and sensibility 
evening at barton park 
it war the evening of a dance 
in which i alluded to a lady i had once known as resembling in some measure your sister marian 
and a answered linton i have not forgotten it he looked pleased by this remembrance and added 
d if i am not deceived by the uncertainty the partiality of tender recollection there is a very mang resemblance between them as well in mind as person the name warmth of heart the same algernon of fancy and spirits 
thin lady was one of my nearest relations an orphan from her infancy and under the guardianship of my father 
our ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years we were plan how 
and friends 
i can not remember the time when did not love liza 
and my affection for her as we grew up was arch as perhaps judging from my present forlorn and cheerlegmvityhyou might think me since blue of having ever eat 
era for me was i believe fervent up the attachment of your sister to mr willoughby and it was though from a different cause no less unfortunate 
at seventeen she was lost to me for ever 
she was married 
married against her inclination to my brother 
her fortune wan large and our family estate much encumber 
and this i fear is all that can be paid for the conduct of one who war at once her uncle and guardian 
my brother did not deserve her 
he did not even love her 
i had hoped that her regard for me would so t her under any difficult and for some time it i 
— but at last the misery of her situation for she experienced great unkindness overcame all her resolution and though she had promised name that nothing 
but how blind i relate l have never told you how this war brought on 
we were within a few hours of groping together for scotland 
the treachery or the folly o my cousin 
maid betrayed us 
i was sense and seusrmu’nv‘ 
or banished to the house of a relation far distant and she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement till my father s point was gained 
i had depended on her fortitude too far and the blow was a severe one 
but had her marriage been happy so young as i then was a few months must have reconciled me to it or at least i should not have new to lament it 
this however was not the one 
my brother had no regard for her his pleasures were not what they ought to have been end from the rest he treated her kindly 
the consequence of this n a mind so young so lively so inexperienced as re grandson s was but too natural 
she herself at first to all the misery of her situation 
and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned 
but can we wonder that with such a husband to provoke constancy and without a friend to advise or restrain her for my father lived only s few months after their marriage and i was with m regiment in the east indies she should fall 
had remained in england perhaps 
but l meant to provoke the happiness of both by removing from her for years and for that purpose had procured my exchange 
the shock which her marriage had given me a he continued in a voice of great agitation 
was of training weight 
— was nothing 
to what i felt when i heard about two years afterwards of her divorce 
it was bob 
which threw this gloom 
even now the recollection of what i suffered 
he could so no more and rising hastily walked for a few minutes a ut the room 
linton a bed by his relations and still more by his distress could not speak 
he saw her concern and coming to her took her hand pressed it and kissed it with grateful respect 
a few minutes more of talent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure 
4 sense and sensibility 
a it was nearly three year after this unhappy period before i returned to england 
my first care when i did arrive was of course to seek for her 
but the reach wan as fruitless a. it wan melancholy 
i could not trace her beyond her first saucer and there wan every moon to fear that the had removed from him only to think deeper in a life of sin 
her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance and i learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person 
he imagined and calmly could he imagine it that her extravagance and consequent distress had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief 
at in however and after i had been six months in england i m and her 
regard for a former servant of my own who had since fallen into misfortune carried me to visit him in a apunging-houae where he wan confined for debt 
and there in the same house under a similar confinement was my unfortunate linger 
so altered 
co faded 
whom down by acute suffering of every kind 
hardly could i believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me to be the remain of the lovely blooming beautiful girl on whom i had once coated 
what i endured in so beholding her 
but i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it 
i have pained you too much already 
that the was to all appearance in the lam 
stage of a consumption wan 
yet in such a situation it was my great comfort 
life could do nothing for her beyond giving time for a better preparation for death 
and that wan given 
i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings and under proper attendants 
i visited her every day during the rent of her short life wail with her in her ant moment 
again he stopped to recover itself 
and linton sense and sensibility 
2 3 he her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern it the fate of his unfortunate friend 
your sister i hope can not be offend a said he by the resemblance i have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation 
their fates their fortunes can not be the same 
and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a former mind or a happier marriage she might have been all that you will live to see the other be 
but to what does all this lead 
i seem to have been distressing you for nothing 
ah 
miss dashed 
a subject such as this 
untouched for fourteen years 
it is dangerous to handle it at all 
i will be more collected 
more concise 
she left to my care her only little child a little girl the offspring of her first guilty connection who was then about three years old 
she loved the child and had always kept it with her 
it was a valued a precious trust to me 
and gladly would i have discharged it in the straightest sense by watching over her education myself had the nature of our situations allowed it 
but i had no family no home 
and my little lizard was therefore placed at school 
i saw her there whenever i could and after the death of my brother which happened about ever years ago and which left me the on of the family y p sty she frequently visited me at eyford 
i called er a distant relation 
but l am well aware that i have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her 
it is now three year 
ago she had cut reached her fourteenth year that i removed her morn school to place her under the care of a very respectable woman residing in dorsetshire who had the charge of four or over other girls of about the same time of life 
and for two years i had every reason to be pleased with her situation 
but last february almost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared 
i had allowed her imprudently a it 4d skims 
and sensibility 
huainoemmdout athereamertdeeire forgot bath with one of her young friend who wan attending her father there for hit health

better than she deserved or with a molt obstinate and ill-judged decry the would tell nothing would give no clue though the certainly knew all 
he her father 
a well 
meaning but not a quick-witted man could really i believe give no information 
for he had been generally confined to the home while the girl were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose 
and he tried to convince me a thoroughly n he war convinced himself of his daughter being entirely unconcerned in the hardness 
in short i could learn nothing but that the van gone 
all the rent for eight long month wan left to conjecture 
what i thought what i failed may be imagined 
and what i suffered too good heavens cried linton should it he 
could willoughby 
j the first news that reached me of her a he continued came in a letter from behalf last october 
it was forwarded to me from eyford and i received it on the very morning of our intended party to whiten 
and this war the rent of my leaving barton to suddenly which i am lure must at the time have animal stung to everybody and which i believe gave once to name 
little did mr willoughhy imagine i suppose when his look ensured me for civility in breaking up the party that i wan called away to the relief of one whom he had made r and miserable 
but ball be known it what wonltlpi’lj have availed 
would he have been gay or less happy in the miles of your sister 
no he ha already done that which no man who can feel for another would do 
he had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had sense and sensibility 
4 secured in a situation of the utmost distress with no creditable home no help no friends ignorant of his address 
he had left her promising to return 
he neither returned nor wrote nor replied her this is beyond everything 
exclaimed linton 
a his character it now before you 
expensive dissipated and worse than both 
knowing all this at i hen now known it many weeks guess what i must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever and on being assured that the was to marry him 
guess what i must have felt for all your sakes 
when 10 came to you last week and found you alone i came determined to know the truth thou h irresolute what to do when it my known 
my behaviour must have seemed strange to you then s but now you will comprehend it 
to suffer you ill to be so deceived 
to thee your sister 
but what could i do 
i had no hope of interfering with succeed 
and sometimes i thought your sister s influence might yet reclaim him 
but now after such dishonourable usage who can tell what were his dregs on her 
whatever they may have been however the may now and hereafter doubtless mid turn with gratitude towards her own condition when she compress it with that of my poor elias when the consider the wretched and hopeless situation of this r girl and her to herself with in affection or him at strong still at strong as her own and with a mind tormented by self-reproach which must attend her through life 
surely this comparison must have its use with her 
she will feel her own offering to be nothing 
they proceed from no conduct and can bring no disgrace 
on the contrary every friend must be made still more her friend by them 
concern for her unhappiness and respect for her fortitude under it must strengthen every attachment 
use your own discretion however in communicating to her what i have told you 
you must know best what 4 sense and smsrsrurv 
will beineffect 
but had notseriouslysndfrom my heart believed it might be of service might lessen her regrets i would not have suffered ran self to trouble you with this account of my family a actions with s recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others 
elinor’s thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestest 
attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to marian from the communication of what had passed

linton startled by his manner looked at him anxiously saying 
— a what 
have you met him to 
d i could meet him in no other way 
liza had confessed to me though most reluctantly the name of her lover 
and when he returned to town which was within a fortnight after myself we met by a instrument he to defend i to punish his conduct 
e matured unbounded and the meeting therefore never got abroad elixir sighed over the fancied necessity of thin

as soon as she recovered from her lying-in for i found her near her delivery i removed her and her child into the country and there she remained recollecting soon afterwards that he was probably dividing linton from her sister he put an end to lull visit receiving from her again the urn grateful acknowledgment and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him

such as e former had hoped to see 
not that manner appeared to thrust the truth of any part of it for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention made neither objection nor remark latter led no indications of willoughby and seemed to shew y her tears that she felt it to be impossible 
but though this behaviour assured linton that the conviction his guilt em carried home to her mind

sense and sensibility 
149 from all danger of seeing willoughby again her mother considered her to be at least equally safe in town as in the country since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all who call themselves her friends 
design could never bring them in each other way 
negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise 
and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of london than even in the retirement of barton where it might force him before her while pa g that visit at allenharn on his marriage which mrs touchwood from 
freeing at first as a probable event had brought herself to expect as a certain one 
she had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were 
a letter from her son-inlaw had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of february and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother 
marian had promised to be guided by her mother opinion and she submitted to it therefore without opposition though it proved perfectly different from what she wished and expected though she felt it to be entirely wrong formed on mistaken grounds and that by requiring her longer continuance in london it deprived her of the only possible alleviation of her wretchedness the personal sympathy of her mother and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent her ever know a moment rest 
but it was a matter of great consolation to her that what broughtevil to herself would bring good to her sister 
and linton on the other hand suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid edward entirely comforted herself by thinking that though their longer stay would therefore militant against her own happiness it would be better for marriage than an immediate return into devonshire

it would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came

linton with great civility declined the proposal 
a her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed or in her dressing-gown an therefore not able to come to them 
oh if that all cried miss steel we can just as well go and see her linton began to and this impertinence too much for her temper 
but she was saved the trouble of checking it by lucy sharp reprimand which now as on many occasions though it did not give much sweetness to the manners of one sister was of advantage in governing those of the other 
hum iii after some opposition 
marian yielded to her sister s entreaties and consented to go out with her and mrs penning one morning for half an hour 
she expressly conditions however for paying no visits 
and would do no more than accompany them to grass in sackville-street where linton was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother 
when they stopped at the door mrs penning recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call 
and as she had no business at gray s 
it was resolved that while her young friends transacted theirs she should pay her visit and return for them 
so sense and sensibility 
on ascending the stairs the miss woods find so many people before them in the room that there was not i person at liberty to attend to their order 
and they were obliged to wait 
all that could be done to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession 
one gentleman only was standing there and it is probable that linton was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch 
but the compactness of his eye and the r delicacy of his taste proved to be beyond his politeness 
he was giving orders for n toothpick-case for himself and till its size hag and ornaments were determined 
all of which a tear examining and eating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop were really arranged by his own inventive fancy 
he had no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies than what was comprised in dim or four very broad stares 
a kind of notice which served to imprint on linton the remembrance of a person and face of strong natural stealing insignificance though adorned in the first water of fashion 
marian was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment on this impertinent examination of their features and on the puppy of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick-cases resented to his inspection remaining unconscious o it all 
for she was as we able to collect her thoughts within herself and be as ignorant of what was passing around her in mr grays sphinx as in her own bed-room 
t last the fair was decided 
the ivory the old and the pearls all received their appointment an 
the gentleman having named the last day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of the toothpick-case drew on his gloves with leisurely care and bestowing another glance on the miss danseuse and sensible 
7 woods but such a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration walked of with an happy air of real conceit and affected indifference 
linton lost no time in bringing her business forward and was on the point of concluding it when another gentleman presented himself at her side 
she turned her eyes towards his face and found him with some so rise to be her brother 
heir affection and pleasure in meeting was june enough to make 3 ve creditable appearance in mr grays shop 
john oath was really far from being sorry to see his sisters again 
it rather gave them i action 
and his inquiries after their mother were mile and attentive 
nor found that he and fanny had been in town two days 
i wished very much to call upon you yesterday a mid he a but it was impossible for we were obliged to take hurry to see the wild beam at exerted exchange and we spent the rest of the day with mrs ferrets 
hurry was vastly pleased 
thus morning i had fully intended to call on you if i could possibly and a spare half-hour but one has always so much to do on link coming to town 
i no come here to speak farm n seal 
but to 
morrow i think i shall certainly be a e to call in berkeley-string and be introduced to your friend mrs penning 
i demand she is a woman of very good fortune 
and the middleton too you must introduce me to 1100 
as my mother-in-law relations i shall be happy to show them every respect 
they are excellent neighbours to you in the county i understand a excellent indeed 
their attention to our comfort their friendliness in every particular is more than i can express 
i am extremely glad to hear it upon my word

extend glad indeed 
but so it oughttobe 
they repent of hrgefmmdieymnlatedwmand every civility and accommodatiogethxt can serve to make your situation learnt might reasonably expected 
and so you are most comfortably settled hi your little cottage and want for nothing 
edward brought us a most charming account of the place 
the most complete thing of in kind he said that ever was and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond anything 
it was a great satisfaction to us to hear it i assure ou 
linton did feel a little ashamed of her brother 
and was not sorry to be red the necessity of answering him by the arrival of mrs jennings’s servant who am so tell her that his mistress waited for them it the door 
mr dashed attended them down stairs v introduced to mrs evenings at the door of her carriage and repeating his hope of being able to call on them the next day look leave 
his visit was duly paid 
he came with a pretence at an a logy from their sister-in-law for not coming too 
a ut she was to much engaged with her mother that really the had no leisure for going anywhere mrs penning however assured him directly that she should not stand upon common for the were all counting or something like it an she should d certainly wait on mrs john dead-wood very soon and bring her sisters to see her 
his manners to in though calm were perfectly kind 
to mrs penning most attentive civil 
and on colonel abandons coming in soon after himself he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say that he only wanted to know him to be rich to be equally civil to him 
after staying with them half an hour he asked linton to walk with him to conduit-street and introduce him to sir john and lady middleton 
the weather was sense and sensibility 
9 remarkably line and she readily contented 
as soon as were out of the house his inquiries began 
a who is colonel grandson 
is he a man of fortune p 4 
yes 
he has a v good re in donetshire.” i am glad of incline gentlemanly man and i think linton i may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life a me brother 
what do you mean i d she likes you 
i observed him arrow and am convinced of it 
what is the amount of his returned it 
i believe about two thousand 3-year.” a two thousand years 
a anthem working himself up to e pitch of enthusiastic generosity he added a linton i wish with all my hurt it were nice as much for our sake 
and i believe you a lied minor a but i am very sure that colonel branch has not the smallest with of marrying rue 
b you are mistaken minor 
you are very much mistaken 
a very little trouble on your side secure him 
perhaps just at resent he may be undecided 
the smallness of your liirtunc may make him long back 
his friends may all advise him against it 
but some of those little attendant and encourage which ladies can no easily give will ax him in spite of himself 
and there no reason why you should not try for him 
it is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side 
in short you know as to an nmrchmem of that kind it is quite out of the question the objections are insurmountable have too much sense not to see all that 
colonel grandson must be the man 
and no civility shall be wanting an my part to make him pleased with you and your family 
it ii a match that me give universal satisfaction 
31 short it is a kind of thing that 
— lowering his voice to an important whisper 
6d suds and sausrnrurv 
a will be exceedingly welcome to all parties recollecting himself however he added that if i mean to lay 
your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled fanny particularly for she has your interest very much at heart assure you 
and her mother too mrs fear a very good 
mature woman i am are it would give her great pleasure the aid as much the other day linton would not vouchsafed any answer 
a it would be something remarkable now a he continued a something droll if fanny should have a brother and i a sister settling at the same time 
and yet it is not ve unlikely a world edward fear a said linton with resolution a going to be married 
a it is not actually settled hut there in such a thing in agitation 
he has a most excellent mother 
mrs terms with the utmost lilx-rnlity will come forward and settle on him a thousand years if the match takes place 
the lady is the honourable miss norton only daughter of the late lord norton with thirty thousand pounds 
a very desirable connection on both sides and i have not a doubt of its taking place in time 
a thousand years is a great deal for a mother to give away to make over for ever 
but mr error has a noble grit 
to give you another instance of her liberality 
be other day as soon as we came to town aware that money could not he very plenty with us just now the put bank-notes into fanny hands to the amount of two hundred pounds 
and extremely acceptable it is for we must live at a great expense while we are here he paused for her assent and companion 
and the forced herself to say 
a your expense both in town and country must certainly be considerable but your income is a large one a not so large i dare say as many people suppose 
sense and sensibility 
by i do not mean to complain however 
it is undoubtedly a comfortable one and i hope will in time he better 
the enclosure of holland common now carrying on is a most serious drains 
and then i have made a little purchase within this half-dead 
em kinsman farm on must remember the place where old been used to give 
the land was so very desirable for me in every rest c to immediately adjoining my own property that i eat it my duty to buy it 
i could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands 
a mug must pay for his convenience and it but coat me a vast deal of money a more than you think it really and intrinsically worth 
why i hope not that 
i might have sold it again the next day for more than i gave but with regard to the purchawmoney i might have been very unfortunate indeed 
for the stock were at that time so low that if i had not happened to have the necessary sum in m bankers hand i must have sold out to very great loss 
a linton could only smile 
mother great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to scotland 
our respected father an you well know bequeathed all the still effects that remained at ireland and very valuable they were to your mother 
far be it for me to repose at his doing so 
he had an uncouth right to dispose of his own property as he chose 
but in consequence of it we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen china c. to supply the place of what was taken away 
you may guess after all these expenses how very eve must be from being rich and how acceptable my fear i kindness is a certainly a said linton

she seems a most valuable woman indeed 
her house her style of living all bespeak an exceeding good income and it it an acquaintance that has not of y been of great use to you hitherto but in the end may prove materially advantageous 
her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour 
and indeed it speaks altogether so great a regard for you that in all probability when the dies you will not be forgotten 
she must have a neat deal to leave nothing at a i should rather suppose 
for the had only her moisture which will descend to her children a but it in not to be imagined that shelves up to her income 
few people of common prudence will do bear 
and whatever the saves the will be able to dispose of a sense and sense 
b ll 
by a and do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters than to us 
a her daughters are both exceedingly well married and therefore i can not perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther 
whereas in my opinion by her taking so much notice of you and treating you in this kind of way she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration which a conscientious woman would not disregard 
nothing can be kinder than her behaviour 
and she can hardly do all this without being aware of the expectations she raises 
a but she raises none in those most concerned 
indeed brother your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries on too far d i y to be sure a said he seeming to recollect himself people have little have very little in their power 
but my dear linton what is the matter with marian 
— she looks very unwell has lost her colour and is grown quite thin 
is she ill 
a d she is not well she has had a nervous complaint on her for seals weeks i am sorry for that 
at her time of life nothing of an illness destroy the bloom for ever 
hers has been a very short one 
she was as handsome s girl lad september as any i ever saw and as likely to attract the men 
there was something in her style of beauty c to please them particularly 
i remember fanny unseat my that she would marry sooner and better than you did 
not but what she is exceedingly fond of you 
but so it happened to strike her 
she will be mistaken however 
i question whether marian now will marry a man worth more than ever or six hundred years at the utmost and tim very much deceived if you do not do better

of her marrying colonel grandson 
but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished and he was really resolve on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman and promising the marriage by every blue attention 
he had compunction enough lad having done nothing for his sisters himself to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal 
and an offer from colonel branch or a logy from man leaning wait the easiest mean of attending for his own neglect 
they were lucky enough to and lady middleton at home and sir john came in before their visit ended 
abundance of civility paused on all hides

and my penning too an exceeding well-behaved woman though not so elegant as her daughter 
your finger need not have any scruple even of visiting her which to say the truth has been a little the cane and very naturally 
for we only knew that my penning wan the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way

linton wanted very much to know though she did not chase to ask whether edward was then in town 
but nothing would have induced fanny voluntarily to mention his name before her till able to tell her that his with miss norton was resolved on or till her husband's expectations on colonel abandons were entered 
because she believed them still so very much attached to each other that they could not be too sedulously divided in word and deed on ever occasion

lucy came very ii

he dared not come to bartlett'buildingt for fear of deduction and though their mutual impatience to meet wo not to he told they could do nothing at peter but write 
edward assured them himself of hit laying in town within a very short time by twice calling in berkeleyureet

linton was pleased that he had called and still more planted that the had mind him 
the manhood were it prodigiously delighted with the middleton that though not much in the habit of giving anything they determined to give them a dinner and won after their acquaintance began invited them to dine in harley-street where they had taken a very good boon for three months 
their sisters and mrs join a were invited likewise and john touchwood wan care to secure colonel grandson who always glad to be where the mine dashwooda were 
received his eager civilities with tome surprise but much more pleasure 
they were to met mr ferry 
but linton could not learn whether her joe were to be of the party 
the expectation of seeing iver however was enough to make her interested in the engagement 
for though the could now meet edward s mother without that strong anxiety which had once dprornioed to attend such an introduction though the cool now see her with perfect indifference an to her union of herself her desire of being in comes 
any with n terrors her curiosity to know what the wan like was a lively an ever

6d so well had they recommended themselves to lady middleton so agreeable had their neliduitiee made them to her that though lucy wan certainly not elegant and her sister not even genteel she was an ready sir john to ask them to spend a week or two in conduit-amen and it happened to be rtieularl convenient the main steeples at soon as the show a invitation known that their visit should begin a few days before the party took place 
their claims to the notice of my john touchwood an the niece of the gentleman who for many year had had the care of her brother might not have done much however towards procuring them acme at her table 
but as lady middleton guests they must be welcome 
and lucky who had long wanted to be really known to the family to have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to lease them had seldom been ha her in her life than she was on receiving mrs john ashwood’e card 
on linton its effect was very different

and to thee him forftllie first time after that poured in the comer y y a l 
she hardly knew how she could bear italian y these apprehensions perhaps were not founded entirely on reason and certainly not at all on truth 
they were relieved however not her own recollection but by the goodwill of lucy who believed herself to be insisting a severe disappointment when he told her that edward certainly would not be in harley-street on indeed end even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther y minding her that he will kept away by that extreme a action for herself which he wild not conceal when they were together

but instead of doing that she secured her and with great sincerity that she did pity her

her complexion was allow and her features small without beauty and naturally without expressions but a lucky commotion of the brow had reached her countenance from the disgrace of inlipidity by giving it the strong characters of pink and ill-nature 
she was not a woman of many words 
for unlike people in general the proportions them to the number of her idea and of the few syllables that did couple her not one fell tother share of mine dead-wood whom the eyed with the spirited determination of dividing her at all events

while she herself who had comparatively no power to wound them sat pointedly slighted is both

quite as handsome a minor 
now you see it is all gone chapter 750 
lords curiosity to see mrs ferrets was satisfied 
she had found in her everything that could tend to make a farther connection between the families desirable 
she had seen enough of her pride her manners and her determined prejudice again here to comprehend all the ditch ties that insect have replied the engagement 
and retarded the marriage of edward and herself had he been otherwise free 
and he had seen almost enough to be thankful for her own sake that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of my forrard creation preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice or 7s us and smsmu'rv

linton wished to talk of something else but lucy sense and sensibility

undoubtedly if th had known your engagement d said the soothing co d be more battering than their treatment of you 
but as that we 
not the clue 
d i guessed you would say no a lied lu quickly 
but there wan no reason in the wor d why a fear should seem to like me if she did mob 
and her liking me in thing 
you that milk me out of my satisfaction 
am sure it will all end well and there will be no difficulties at all to what i used to think 
my forrard a charming woman and lo in your sister 
th are both delightful women indeed 
... i wonder i who never hear you say how agreeable mrs dashed was p c to this liquor had no answer to make and did not after t any

i am glad of it with all my heart but really you did not look it 
i should be so so to have you ll 
— you that have been the greatest come on to me in the world 
— heaven known what i should have done without your friendship 
linton tried to make a civil unrest though doubling her own succeed 
but it yearned to satisfy lucy for the directly replied 
indeed i am seemly convinced of your regard for me and next to dawn i love it in the great comfort i have 
poor edward 
but now there in one good thing 
we shall be able to meet and meet retty often for lady middleton he delighted with my e wood 2 we shall be a good deal in harley-meet i due a and edward spend half his time with his sister 
deaf lady middleton and mrs forrard will 7s sons and snusrmu-rv 
visit now 
and mrs forrard your sister were both so good to say more than once they should always be glad to see me 
— th are such charming women l 
i am sure if ever you tell your sister what i think of her you can not speak too high but linton would not give her any encouragement to hope that she low 
tell her sister 
lucy continued i am sure should have seen it in a moment if mrs fear had took a dislike to me 
if she had only made me a formal curtsey for instance without saying a word and never after had took any notice of me and never looked at me in a pleasant way 
you know what i ram 
if i had been treated in that forbidding sort of way i should have gave it all up in d or 
i could not have stood it 
for where she doe die like i know it in most violent linton was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph by the door s being thrown open the servants announcing mr friars and towards immediate walking in 
a it was a very awkward moment 
and the countenance of each showed that it was so 
they all looked exceedingly foolish 
and edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again as to advance farther into it 
the very circumstance in its unpleasantness form which they would each have been most anxious to avoid had fallen on them 
they were not only all three together but were together without the relief of any other person 
the ladies recovered themselves 31st 
it was not lucy business to put herself forward and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up 
she could therefore only look 
her tenderness and after slightly addressing him said no more 
but linton had more to do 
and so anxious was she for his sake and her own to do it well that the forced herself after a moment s recollection to welcome him sense and sensibility 
77 with a look and manner that were almost easy and almost n 
and another struggle another effort still improve them 
she would not allow the presence of lucy nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself to defer her from saying that she was y to see him and that she had very much regretted 2 g from home when he called before in berkeley-meet 
she would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which as a friend and almost a relation were his due by the observant eyes of lucy though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her 
her manners gave some assurance to edward and he led courage enough to sit down 
but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion which the case rendered reasonable though his sex might make it rare 
for his heart had not the indifference of lucy s nor could his conscience have quite the ease of elinor‘s 
lucy with a secure and settled air seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the other and would not say a word 
and almost everything that war said receded from linton who was led to volunteer blithe information about her mother th their coming to town c. which edward ought to have inquired about but never did 
her exertions did not no here 
for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroic disposed as to determine under pretence of fetching marines to leave the others by themselves 
and she really did it and but in the handsomest manner for she loitered away several minutes a on the landing place with the most light-minded fortitude before she went to her finger 
when that was once done however it was time for the rapture of edward to cease 
for marian's joy hurried her into the drawn from immediately

but even this encouragement failed for he would go

said marian on her leaving them

we were all his tin-mine and lucy hat been the longest known to him of any

marian looked at her steadily and aid you know linton that this is a kind of talking which i can not bear 
if on only hope to have your assertion contradicted an must suppose to he the case you ought to recollect that i am the last person in the world to do it

and linton dared not follow her to y more for bound as the wall by her promise of secrecy to lucy she could give no information that would convince arrange 
and painful an the consequence of her still continuing in an error might be the was obliged to submit to it 
all that the could hope was that edward would not often expose her or himself to the ditch of hearing marianne’l mistaken warmth nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended their recent meeting

think i few day 
after thin meeting the newlpogen announced to the world that the lady s thomas palmer esq woe safer delivered of a inn and heir 
a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph at least to all those intimate connection 
who knew it before this event hi holy important to mrjenniogr’a happiness produced a temporary duration in the disposal of her time and invented in a. like degree the engagement of her young friends 3 for she wished to he at much a possible with charlie the went thither every morning at soon a the wan dressed and did not return till late in the evening 
and the mine duhwoodr at the particular request of the middleton t the whole every day in conduit-meet 
for own comfort they would much rather have remained at lent all the morning in mrs jenninge’e home 
but it war not a thing the urged against the writer of eve body 
their hour were therefore made over to lady i eton and the two mine steel 
by whom their can 
a war in fact a little valued a it was profoundly all in hey had too much sense to be clink companions to former 
and by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye it intruding on their ground and charlie the kindness which they wanted to monolith 
ugh nothing could be more life than any middleton behaviour to linton in marriage she did not really like them at all 
became they neither buttered himself nor her children she could not believe them good-natured 
and became they were fond of tending she received them satirical perhaps without exactly knowing what it w to be trial 
but 26 117 r 82 sense and snusmm'rv 
did not signify 
it wan endured in common see and energy given 
heir renounce we a restraint both on her and on lucy 
t checked the idle of one and the business of the other 
lady middleton wan ashamed of doing nothing before them and the flattery which lucy wan mid to think of and administered at other times the ed they would despite her for observing 
mine steel was the least discompose of the three by their pretence 
and it was in their power to reconcile her to it entirely 
would either of them only have given her a full and minute account of the whole affair between marian and mr willoughhy the would have thought herself amply rewarded for the carriage of the belt place h the re after dinner which their arrival occasioned 
gun thin conciliating wan not granted 
for though the often threw out expression of pity for her toller to linton and more than once dry bed a reflection on the incomtancy of beauty before one no ernest we produced but a look of indifference from the former or of disgust in the latter 
an effort even yet lighter might have made her their friend 
would they only have laughed at her about the doctor 
but to little were they any more than the other inclined to oblige her that if sir john dined from home the might spend a whole day without hearing any other misery on the subject than what she was kind enough to been on herself 
all these jealous and discontent however were to totally unsuspected by my jings that she thought it a delightful thing for the girls to be together 
and general congratulated her young friends every night on having escaped the company of a no i old woman to long 
she joined them sometimes at it john s and sometimes at her own house 
but wherever it wan the army came in excellent spirits full of delight and sense and sensibility 
83 romance distributing charlotte’s welling to her own care and ready to give so exact so minute a detail of her situation as only ma steel had curiosity enough to desire 
one thin m disturb her 
and of that she made her daily come into 
mr palmer maintained the common but unfairly opinion among his sex of all infants heir alike 
and though she could plainly perceive at i rent times the most striking resemblance between this baby and every one of his relations on both sides there was no convincing his father of it 
no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like of game other baby of the same age 
nor could he even brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of in being the nest child in the world 
i come now to the relation of a misfortune which about this time befall mrs john dashed 
it so happened that while her two sisters with mrs evenings were 31st calling on her in harley-street 
another of her acquaintance had dropped in 
a circumstance in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her 
but while the imaginations a other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct and to decide on it by slight appearances once happiness must in some measure be always at the more of chance 
on the present instance this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy so far to outrun truth and probability that on merely hearing the name of the miss dashwoods and a understanding them to be mr touchwood s sisters she immediately concluded them to be staying in harley street 
on this misconstruch produced within 3 s or two afterwards cards of invitation for them as we as for their brother and sister to a small musical party at her house 
the consequence of which was that mrs john dashed was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly rat inconvenience of sending her carriage for the miss dashwoods but what was still 84 sense and sensibility 
wont must be object to all the unpleasantness of up ring to treat them with attention and who could i that the might not expect to go out with her a second time the power of disappointing them it was true must always be here 
but that was not em 
for when people are determined on a mode of corn act which they know to be wrong they feel injured by the ax reception of anything better from them 
rann had now been brought by degrees 10 much into the habit of going out every day that it we 
become a matter of indolence to her whether she went or not and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every evening s engagement though without expecting the smallest amusement from any and very often without knowing till the last moment where it wan to take her 
to her dress and appearance she was growing so perfectly indiﬁ'urcnt on not to bestow half the consideration on it during the whole of her toilette which it received from miss steal in the first live minute of their being together when it was finished 
nothing escaped lure minute observation and general curiosity 
she saw everything and asked everything 
was never away till she knew the price of every rest of marianne’l dress 
could have guessed the sum r of her gowns altogether with better judgment than marian herself and was not without hope of sending out before they parted how much her washing cost per week and how much the had every year to spend upon lrcraclf 
the impertinence of these kind of scrutinise moreover was generally concluded with a compliment which though meant an it doer was considered by marriage up the greatest impertinence of all 
for after undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown the colour of her shoes and the arrangement of her hair the was almost sure of being told that upon a her word she looked vastly smart and she dared to say would make a got many conquest sense and sensible 
85 with such encouragement as this was she dismissed on the present occasion to her brothers carriage 
which they were ready to enter eve minutes after it stopped at the door a punctuality not very agreeable to their sister-in-law who had preceded them to the house of her acquaintance and was there hoping for some delay on their part that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman 
the mug of the evening were not very remarkable 
the party like other musical parties comprehended a great many people who had real taste for the performance and n great many more who had none at nil 
and the performers themselves were 
as usual in their own station and that of their immediate friends the first private performers in england 
as linton was neither musical nor affecting to he so she made no scruple of turning away her eyes from the grand pinafore whenever it suite her and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp and a violence would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the room 
in one of these exclusive glances she perceived among the group of young men the very he who had given them a lecture on toothpick-cases at gray 
she perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself and speaking familiarly to her brother 
and had determined to find out his name from the latter when they both came towards her and mr dashed introduced him to her as mr robert fender 
he addressed her with easy civility and twisted his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done that he was exact the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by lucy 
happy had it been for her if her regard for edward had depended less on his own merit than on the merit of his nearest relations 
for then his brother s bow must have given the vanishing stroke to what ill-humour of his mother 85 sense nun sensrnru-rv 
and finer would have begun 
but while the wondered at the difference of the two young men the did not and that the empire and conceit of the one put her at all out of charity with the modesty and worth of the other 
why they were different robert explained to her himself in the more of a quarter of an hour conversation 
for talking of hi 
brother and lamenting the extreme gaucberic which he really believed kept him from missing in proper gaiety he candidly and generous attributed it much ll ll to any natural deficiency than to the fortune of a private education 
while he himself though probably without any particular any material superior y nature merely from the advantage of a. public echo wan an well attend to mix in the world as any other man 
a upon my soul 3 he added a i believe it is nothing more and so i often tell my mother when he in grieving about it 
my dear madam d i always any to her you must make yourself easy 
the evil in now irrenrcdiablc and it has been entirely your own doing 
why would you be persuaded by my uncle sir robert against your own judgment to place edward under private tuition at the most critical time of his life 
if on her only sent him to westminster at well at myself instead of sending him to mr prattle all this would have been prevented this ll the way in which i always consider the matter and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error 
linton would not oppose his opinion became whatever might be her general extinction of the advantage of a public school she could not think of edward abode in mr raft s family with any action 
b you reside in devonshire i think was till next observation in a cottage near dawlish.” elixir set him right as to its situation and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody could live in sense and sensmu'rv 
87 devonshire without living near drawled 
he bestowed 31 hearty approbation however on their of use 
a for my own part a said he i am exceedingly fond of a cottage 
there it always to much comfort so much elegance about them 
and i detest 
if i had any money to a re i should buy a li e land and build one myself wi n a short dinner of london where i might drive myself down at any time and collect a few friend about me and be happy 
i advise everybody who is going to build to bully cottage 
my friend lord courtyard came to me the other city on purpose to ink in advice and laid before three inherent plane of noise 
i was to decide on the beat of them 
a my dear courted a said i immediately throwing them all into the fire do not ado either of them but b all means build a cottage ed that i fancy will the end of it 
a some people imagine that there can be no accommodation no e in a cottage 
but this in all a mistake 
i warm month at my friend elliott’s near hereford 
lady enlist village to give a dance 
a but how can it be done 
a laid the 
a my dear peruse do tell me how it it to he managed 
there ll not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple and where can the an be 2 d i immediately taw thatcher could he no city in it so i said my dear lady elliotti do not be uneasy 
the dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease 
cardinal i may be placed in the drawing-room 
the library may be of for tea and other refreshment 
and let the upper set out in the ialoon.’ lady enlist wan delighted with the thought 
we entered the dining-room and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple and the affair war arc ranged precisely after my plan 
so that in fact you lee if people do but know how to set about it every 88 snubs and seusruru'rv 
comfort may be at well enjoyed in a come as in the most spacious dwelling 
linton agreed to it all for she did not think he deserved the comer linen of rational supposition as john dane wood had no more pleasure in much than hit eldest litter his mind what equally at liberty to ax on anything else 
and a thought strut him during the evening which he communicated to his wife for her approbation when they got home 
the consideration of mrs dennison’s mistake in supposing his linen their guests had suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become ouch while mrs penning s end engagement kept her from home 
the expense would be nothing the inconvenience not more 
and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy of hi conscience inland out to be requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to hit father 
fanny wan startled at the proposal 
d i do not lee how it can be done a said she a without aﬁi'onting lady middleton for they spend every day with her 
otherwise i should be exceedingly glad to do it 
you know i am always ready to pay them any attention in my power as my taking them out this evening them 
but they are lady middleton visitor 
how can i ask them away from her 
her husband but with great humility did not see the force of her objection 
they had already spent a week in this manner in conduit-street and lady middleton could not be displeased at their giving the name number of days to such near relations 
fancy paused a moment and then with fresh vigour us 2 a my love i would ask them with all my heart if it was in my power 
but i had just settled within myself to ink the miss steeples to spend a few days with us 
they are very well-behaved good kind of girls 
and i sense and sensxnm'rv 
89 think the attention is due to them as their uncle did so very well by edward 
we can ask your sisters some other year you know 
but the miss steel may not being town more 
am sure will like them 
indeed you like them you know very much already and so does my mother 
and they are such favourites with varry 
mr dashed was convinced saw the security of inviting the miss steel immediately and his conscience was parched by the resolution of inviting his linen another year 
at the same time however shyly suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless bringing linton to town as colonel abandons wife and ne a mere visitor 
farm re chin in her so and mud of the reed wit thatched produced it were thereat morning to 
lucy to not her company and her sister for some days in bar street as soon so lady middleton could spare them 
this was enough to make lucy really and reasonably happy 
mrs dead-wood seemed actually working for her herself cherishing all her hopes and promising all her views 
such an opportunity of being with edward and his family was above all things the most material to her interest and such an invitation the most gratifying to her feelings 
it was an advantage that could not he too graceful acknowledged nor too speedily made use of 
and the visit to lady middleton which had not before had any precise limits was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two day time 
hen the note was shown to linton a it was within ten minutes after its arrival it gave her for the list time 
some share in the expectations of lucy 
for such a mark of uncommon kindness touched on so short an acquaintance seemed to declare that the goodwill towards her arose from something more than merely 90 sense and sbnsibiutv

and there were expect that laid open the probability of greater 
the main steeples removed to harley-meet and all that reached linton of their influence there men her expectation of the event 
sir john who on them more than once brought home such account the favour they were in a must he universally striking 
my dead-wood had never been to much pleased with any young women in her life an the wet with them s had given each of them a needle-work made by some emigrant

and did not know whether she should ever be able to part with them 
child 
i'll re palmer was to well at the end fortnight that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her 
and confronting herself with visiting her once or twice a day returned from that period to her own lawns and her own habits in which she found the main daahwoodl very ready to resume their former share 
about the third or fourth morning after their being that re-entered in berkeley-street 17 leaning on returning from her ordinary visit to my palmer entered the drawing-room where linton was sitting by herself with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful 
and giving her time only to form that idea began directly to justify it by laying waymxwuuam 
izz sense and sensibility 9 lord 
my dear miss touchwood 
have you heard the news p 
no marm 
what is it i d a something so strange 
but on shall hear it all 
when i got to mr papers i end chariot quite in a fuss about the child 
she was sure it was ve ill 
it cried and fretted and was all over prism s 
s i looked at it directly and a lord 
my dear says i a it is nothing in the world but the medium 
e and nurse said us the same 
but marlott she would not be satin ed so mr caravan was sent for 
and luckily he happened to be just come in from harley-street so he sped over directly and as soon as ever he saw the c d he said just as we did that it was nothing in the world but the medium and then chariot was easy 
and so just as he was going away again it came into my head i am sure i do not know how i happened to think of it but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news 
3 upon that he remarked and lingered and looked grave and seemed to know something or other and at last he said in a whisper a for fear any unpleasant report should reach the mug ladies under your ears m to their sisters disposition i think it advisable to say that i believe there is no great mean for alarm 
i hope mrs dashed will do very well 
what is fanny ill 3rd that is exactly what i said my dear 
a lord says i 16a mrs dashed ill 
a so then it all ants out 
and the long and the short of the matter by all i can lem seems to be this 
mr edward forrard the very young man i used to joke with you about but however as it turns out i am monstrous glad there never was anything in it mr edward farms it seems has been engaged above this twelvenwnth to my cousin lucy 
— there s for you my dear l 
and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter except nancy 
— 90 sense and sensibility 
could you have believed such a thing possible p 
there is no great wonder in their liking one another 
but that matter 
should be brought so forward between them and nobody suspect it 
that is strange 
— i never be ed to see them together or i am sure i should have and it out directly 
well and to this was kept a great secret for fear of mrs f error 
and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter 
till this very morning poor nancy who you know is a well-meaning creature but no conjuror t it all out 
a lord 
a thinks she to herself they are 10 so fond of lucy to be sure they will make no difficulty about it 
e and so away she went to your sister who was sitting all alone at her carpet-work little suspecting what was to come 
for she had just been saying to your brother on eve minutes before that she thought to make a mate between edward and some lord s daughter or other i forget who 
so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride 
she fell into violent hysterics immediately with such scream as reached your brother ears as he was sitting in his own dressing-room downstairs thinking about writing a letter to his afterward in the country 
so up he dew directly and a terrible scene took lace for lucy was come to them by that time little reaming what was going on 
poor soul 
i pity lure 
and i must we think she was used very hardly 
for your sister scolded like any fury and won drove her into a fainting fit 
nancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly 
and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know what to do 
mrs dashed declared th should not stay a minute longer in the house and your mother was forced to go down upon bill knees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes 
tom she fell into hysterics again and he was so frightened that he would send for mr jonathan and mr caravan found the sense and sensibility 
3 house in all this uproar 
the carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away and they were stepping in as he came of 
poor lucy in such a condition he says she could hardly walk 
and nancy she was almost as bad 
i declare i have no patience with your sister 
and i hope with all my heart it will be a match in spite of her 
lord 
what a kind poor mr edward will be in when he hears of it 
o have his love used so scornfully for they say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may 
i should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest of passion 
and mr caravan thinks just the same 
he and i had a great deal of talk about it 
and the best of all is that he is gone back again to harley-street that he may be within call when mrs errors is told of it for she was sent for as soon as ever m cousins left the house for your sister was sure as wo d be in hysterical too 
and so she may for what i care 
i have no pity for either of them 
i have no notion of people making such a too about money and greatness 
there is no reason on earth why mr coward and lucy should not marry 
for i am cure mrs forrard may afford to do very well her son 
and though lucy has next to nothing herself she knows better than anybody how in make the most of everything 
and i dare say if mrs form would only allow him over hundred years she would make as good an a prince with it as anybody else would with eight 
lord how snug th might live in such another cottage as yours 
or a little goer 
with two maid and two men 
andibelievei couldhelpthemtoa housemaid for my beauty has a sister out of place that would it them exactly here mr penning ceased and as linton had had time enough to collect her thoughts she was able to give such an newer and make such observations as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce 
— them to 4 sense and serslbllm 
and that the was not life of any extraordinary interesting it 
that my meaning an all had flare often might be the case ceased to heart ached edward 
and happy above lithe put in the absence of marriage she felt very well able to break of the air without embarrass and to give herjudgmcnt an the believed 
with on the oonductofevu-yoneconnemedinit 
she could hardly determine whether awn expectation of its event really was 
— 
though the early tried todrivcawa thenotionofiuheingpouihletoend otherwise than the inrriageof edward lucy 
what my errand would by and do though there could not be a douhofiummrgahewaaanxioul m hm 
and still more anxious to know how edward would conduct minnelli 
for li 
she felt much compassion 
— for lucy ve little 
and it coat her name pains to procure that lit eg 
for the rest of the party none at l 
as mr joining could talk on no other subject elixir noon saw the necessity of preparing marian for in discussion 
— no time war to be lost in undeceiving her in making her acquainted with the real truly in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by when without betraying that she felt any uneasiness her sister or any resentment against edward 
lilinor’l office was a painful own 
she wan going to remove what the really believed to be her sister s chief consolation 
rot give inch particular of edward as the feared would ruin him after ever in her good and to make marian's by a remembrance in their situation which to fancy would ocean strong feel all her own disappointment over again 
but unwelcome in such a tank mun be it was necessary to be done and linton therefore hastened to perform it 
slavery farfromwiahing dwell our own sense and sensibility 
as feelings or to represent herself as suffering much any otherwisethan as the self 
command she had practised since her first knowledge of edward s en a men i t suggest a hint of what was practicable to arrange 
er narration was clear and simple 
and though it could not be given without emotion it was not accompanied violent agitation nor in gem 
that 
belonged rather to the harper for arrange listened with horror and cried excessively 
linton was to be the comforter of others in her own times no less than in theirs 
and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind and a very earnest indication of edward from every charge but of irnpnulence was ready offered 
but rann for some time would ve credit to neither 
edward seemed a second will by 
and acknowledge as linton did that she bad loved him most sincerely could she feel less than herself i as for luck steeple she considered her so totally unmingled so also lately incapable of attracting s sensible man that she could not be persuaded at first to believe and afterwards to pardon any former affection of edward for her 
she would not even admit it to have been natural 
and linton left her to be convinced that it was so by that which only could convince her a. better knowledge of mankind 
her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement and the length of case it had existed 
marian's feelings had then broken in and put an end to all regularity of detail 
and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress lessen her arms and combat her resentment 
the first question on her side which led to farther particulars was 
— 
how long has this been known to you linton 
has he written to you 3 60 sums and sensible 
i have known it the four month 
when lucy that came to barton-gate last november the told me in confidence of her engagement 
at these words arianne’l eyes express the astonishment which her li could not utter 
after n pane of wonder the exact aimed 
— a four months l 
have you known of this mr month 2 
— linton confirmed it 
that l 
while sending me in all my misery 
hum thin been on your heart 2 and i have reached you for being happy 
— a two not at that you should then know how much l was the reverend 
a four months 
cried marian again 
a so calm 
to cheerful i how have you been supported 
b c by feeling that i was doing my duty 
my mind to lucy obliged me to be secret 
i owed it to therefore to avoid giving any hint of the truth 
and i owed it to my family and friends not to create in them a solicitude about me which it could not he in my power to satisfy 
marian seemed much struck 
d i have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother a added elixir 
e and once or twice i have attempted it 
— 
but without betraying my must i never could have convinced you a four months 
— and yet you loved him if eyes 
but i did not love only hira 
— and while the comfort of others was dear to me i wan glad to spare them from knowing how much i felt 
now i can think and speak of it with little emotion 
i would not have you suffer on my account 
for i assure you i no longer asunder materially myself 
i have many thing to support me 
i am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any importance of my own and sense and sensibility 
90 i have home it as much as possible without spreading it farther 
i acquit edward of all essential miseonduet 
i wish him very happy 
and i am so sure of his always doing his duty that though now he may harbour some regret in the end he mun become so 
lucy does not want sense and that is the foundation on which every 
-thingaﬁood m be built 
and after all marian after that is thing in the idea of a single and constant attachment and all that can be said of one's happiness depending entirely on any‘pam'cular person it is not meant 
it is not fit 
it is not possible that it should be so 
edward will marry lucy 
he will marry a woman superior in soon and understanding to half her sex 
and done an habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to em 
d if such is your way of thinking a said marian if thelossofwhatismostvaluedis so easily be made up h something else our resolution your self-command are perhaps a little less to be wondered at 
they are brought more within my comprehension i understand you 
you do not so that i have ever felt much 
for four months ran i have had all this than no on my mind without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature 
knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you t unable to prepare you for it in the least 
it was to 
me 
it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself whose prior engagement mind all prospects 
and told me as i thought with triumph 
his person suspicions therefore i have had to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most deeply interested 
and it has not been only once 
i have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again 
i have known myself to be divided from edward for ever without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire ll 
d 3 sense nun sensibility 
the confusion 
nothing hat proved him forth 
nor huanythingdeeluedhimrndilferentwme 
have had to contend against the unkindness of bitter end the indulgence of big mother and have entered the punishment of an attachment without enjoying lu advantage 
and all this has been going on at a time when no you too well know it has not been my only if you can think me capable of ever feel y you may suppose that i have suffered now 
he so of mind with which i have brought myself at meant to consider the matter the conversation that i have been v willing to admit have been the effect of both and painful exertion g 
they did not spring up of tluerruelvee 10 they did not occur to relieve m spirit at ling 
no marian 
the if i had not been bound to silence peering nothing could have kept me entirely 
not even what owed to my scarce friends 
from openly trowing that i wait my unhappy marian was quite subdued 
a oh 
linton d she cried b you have made me hate myself for ever 
how barbarous have i been to you 
— you who have been my only comfort who have borne with me in all my misery who have seemed be only suffering for me l 
in thin my gratitude 
a thin the only return i can make you 
became your merit cries out upon myself i have been trying to do it army 
the tenderest career followed this confession 
in inch 3 frame of mind be was now in linton had no difficult in obtaining from her whatever prowled she required 3 and at her request marian engaged never to peak of the affair to any one with the lean appear dance of bitterness 
— to meet lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her 
— and even to ice edward himself if chance should bring them together without any diminution of her usual cordiality 
theme were great concessions but where marian felt that the sense and senshihjty 
9th had injured no reparation could be too much for her to make 
she performed her promise of being discreet admiration 
shutter to all that my penning had to say upon the subject with an exchanging complexion dissented from her in nothing and was heard three times to say yes ma'am she listened to her price of lucy with only moving from one chair to another and when mrs penning talked of edward affections it cost her only a pan in her throat such advances towards heroism in her time made editor feel equal to anything herself 
the next morning brought a farther trial of it in a visit from their brother who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful affair and bring them new of his wife 
i d i d you have heard suppose a said he with solemnity as soon as he was seated of thesvleury‘ shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday 
they all looked their went 
it seemed too awful a moment for speech 
a your sister a he continued a has suffered dreadfully 
mrs ferrets too 
in short it his been a scene of such complicated distress 
but i will hope that the atom may be weathered without our being any of un quite overcome 
poor fanny 
she was in hysterics all merry 
but i would not alarm you too much 
rann says there is nothing materially to be apprehended 
her constitution in a good one and her resolution equal to anything 
she has home it all with the fortitude of an angel 
she says she never shall think well of anybody again 
and one can not wonder at it after being so deceived l 
evening with each ingratitude where so much kindness had been shown so much conscience had been placed 
it was quite out of 250 sense and sbnsibili‘i‘v 
the benevolence of her heart that she had urged there young women to her house 
merely became she thought they deserved some attention were harmless wellhehaved girls and would be pleasant companions 
for otherwise we both wished very much to lure invited you and marriage to he with or while your kind friend there we attending her daughter 
and not be no a rewarded 
i with with all my heart a lie poor funny in her affectionate way a that had invoked your tintern instead of then a here he stopped to be thanked 
which being done he went on 
that poor mrs forrard sufferer when am fanny wrote it to her in not to be described 
while the with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible confession for him was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person i 
such a suspicion could never have entered her head i if the sum led an reputation where it could not be in ii quartet 4 the to he are a laid the i might have thought myself safety she war quite in en ago 
we consulted together however as to what you d be done and at last the determined to lend for edward 
he came 
but i am sorry to relate what ensued 
all that mrs forrard could by to make him put an end to the engagement assisted too at you may well suppose 
by my argument and fancy entreaties was of no avail 
duty nﬂ‘eetion everything war disregarded 
i never thought edward to stubborn 60 unfeeling before 
his mother explained to him her liberal designs in case of his marrying mice norton 
told him the would settle on him the norfolk grate which clear of landau being in a good thousand years 
opened even when matter grew deeper to make twelve hundred 
and in opposition to this if he still persisted in thin low connection represented to him sense and sensible 
lo 
the certain penury that must attend the match 
his own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all 
she would never see him again f and so far would she be from according him the smallest assistance that if he were enter into any profession with a view of better support she would do all in her power to prevent his advancing in it here lausanne in an ecstasy of indignation clapped her hands together and cried a gracious good an this be possible d a well may you wonder marian replied her brother e at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these 
your exclamation is very natural 
marian was going to retort but she remembered her promises and forlorn 
all this however he continued a was urged in vain 
edward said very little 
but what he did say was in the most determined manner 
nothing could prevail on him to give up his engagement 
he would stand to it coat him what it might a then cried mrs penning with blunt sincerity no longer able to be silent a he has acted like an honest man 
i beg your pardon mr manhood but if he had done otherwise i should have thought him a rascal 
i have some little concern in the business as well as yourself for lucy steeple is my cousin and i believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world nor one who more deserves a good husband 
john dashed was greatly astonished 
but his nature was calm not open to provocation and he never wished to offend anybody especially anybody of good fortune 
he therefore reap ed without any resentment 
a d i would by no means a it disrespectfully of any relation of yours madam 
m lucy steeple ii i dare say a very deserving young woman but in the present case you know the connection must be impossible 
and its sense and sensibility 
have entered iritouecretengagemtwith lying a man under her uncle care the son of a woman cordially of such very large fortune on my fear perhaps altogether a little extraordinary 
in short i do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of m whom you have a regard for my penning 
e all wish her extreme happy and my ferrars’a conduct through the who has been such an every conscientious good mother in like circumstance would adopt it had been dignified and liberal 
edward has drawn his own lot and i fear it will be i bad one marian sighed out her millar a pension 
and elinor’s heart wrung for the feelings of edward while braving his mother threats or a woman who could not reward him 
a well sir a laid mr penning and how did it end 2 d i am carry to my ma'am in a most unhappy rupture 
edward is dismissed for ever from his mother s 4 
notice 
he left her home yesterday but where he is one or whether he is still in town i do not know 
or we of course can make no inquiry 
a poor young man 
and what is to become of him in a what indeed marian 
it it a melancholy consideration 
born to the prospect of such nﬂiuencel i can not conceive a situation more deplorable 
the interest of two thousand pounds 
how can a man live on it 
— and when to that is added the recollection that he might hut for his own folly within three months have been in receipt of two thousand over hundred years for miss norton has thirty thousand pounds i can not picture to myself a more wretched condition 
we must all feel for him 
and the more no because it is totally out of our power to artist him a poor young man i 
cried my penning d i am sure he should he very welcome to bed and board at my sense and sensibility 
10th house 
and i would tell him if could see him 
it it not at that he should be living about at his own charge now at lodging and ravenous 
elinor'e heart thanked her for such kindness towards edward though he could not bear smiling at the form of it 
d if he would only have done at well by herself a laid john touchwood us all his friends were disposed do him might now have been in hit ropers situation and would have wanted for nothing 
but i it it it must be out of anybody power to aunt him 
and there ll one thing more repairing against him which mun be worse than all in mother had determined with a very natural kind of spirit to nettle that estate a robert immediately which might have been edwardiani on proper condition 
l left her this morning with her lawyer talking over the business 
4 well i d said my penning 
that is bar revenge 
a mood he a way of their own 
but i don't think rhine coquet be to make one son independent become another had plagued me marian got up and walked about the room 
can anything be more calling to the spirit of a man a continued john than to thee hell anger brother in possession of an estate which wig t have been his own 
poor reward i feel for him tenderly 
a few minute 
more spent in the lame kind of definition concluded his visit 
and with repeated auunneee on his litterthat he really believed there wan no material danger in fancy disposition and that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it he went away 
leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiment on the present occasion at far at least as it regarded my female conduct 
the dashwooda’ and towards 
marinnne’t indignation burst forth as noon at he 104 sense and sensibility 
quittcdthe room 
and uhervehemeneemade reserve impossible in linton and unseemly in man leaning 
they all joined in a very spirited continue upon the party 
charm new 
mrs penning was very warm in her price of edward conduct but only editor and marian understood it true merit 
149 only knew how little he had had to tempt him m be disobedience and how small war the consolation beyond the coneciouaneta of doing right that could remain to him in the lore of friends and fortune 
linton gloried in his integrity 
and marian forgave all his offences in companion for his punishment 
but though confidence between them me by this public discovery letters to it proper rate it was not a subject on which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone 
linton avoid it upon principle an tending to ax still more upon her though by the too wan too positive endurance of 7 marian that belief of edward i continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away 
and marian's courage soon failed her in trying to converse upon a topic which always left her more diautieﬁed with herself than ever by the compulsion it necessarily produced between elinor‘e conduct and her own 
she felt all the force of that comparison 
but not at her sister had hoped to urge her to exertion now 
the felt it with all the pain of continual self-reproach regretted most bitterly that the had never exerted himself before 
but it brought only the torture of penitence without the hope of amusement 
her mind wan so much weakened that the still fancied present exercise and sensibility 
10th noon impossible and therefore it only distorted her more 
nothing new was heard by them for s d or two afterwards of affairs in harley-meet or ardent buildings 
but though so much of the matter was known to them already that mrs penning might have had enough to do in reading that knowledge farther without seeking after more she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousin as soon as she could 
and nothing but the hindrance of more vision than usual had prevented her going to them within that time 
the third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars was so one so beautiful a sunday as to draw many to pension ton gardens though it was only the second week in arch 
mrs penning and linton were of the number 
but marian who knew that the willoughbys were again in town and had a constant dread of meeting them chose rather to stay at home than venture into no public a place 
an intimate acquaintance of mrs penning oiled them soon after they entered the gardens and linton was not so 
i that by her continuing with them and engaged in all is jennings’s conversation she was herself eft to quiet reflection 
she saw nothing of the willoughhys nothing of edward and for some time nothing of anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay be interesting to her 
but at last she found herself with some surprise accosted by miss steel who though looking rather shy expressed great satisfaction in meeting them and on receiving encourage e meat from the particular kindness of mrs evenings ed her own party for a short time to join theirs 
mrs penning immediately whispered to clamor 
“getitallout of her my dear 
she will tell anything you ask 
you see can not leave mrs larks 16a sense and sensibility 
it wan lucky however for mr jenninge’l curiosity sud elinor’l too that the would tell anything without being asked for nothing would otherwise have been learnt 
i am to god w see you d said mill smelt taking her familiarly by the arm a for i wanted to ice you of all things in the world 
and then lowering her voice a i suppose mrs penning has heard all about it 
it she angry 
d a not at all i believe with you 
2 that in a good thing 
and lady middleton in as angry 
i can not suppose it gable that she should 
d i am monstrous glad of it 
goodgﬂcioulld have had such a time of it 
i never saw lug in ouch a rage in my life 
she vowed at first the would never trim me up a new bonnet nor do anything else for me again i long as she lived 
but now she is quite come to and we are as good friend an ever 
look she made me this bow to my hat and put in the feather last night 
there now you are going to laugh at me too 
but why should not i wear pink ribbon 
i do not care if it i the doctor favourite colour 
i am lure for my part i should never have known he did like it better than any other colour if he had not happened to say 
so 
my cousins have been no plaguing me 
i declare eometirnel 
i do not know which way to look before them 
she had wandered away to a subject on which linton had nothing to my and therefore noon judged it expedient to and her way back again to the first 
a well but miss dashed speaking turn faintly people may say what they chose about mr errand declaring he would not have lucy for it be no such a thing i can tell you 
and it i quite a home for such ill-natured reports to be read abroad 
whatever lucy might think about it herself you know it was no business of other people to set it down for certain 
sense and sensxbili‘i'v 
or a i never heard anything of the kind hinted at before i assure on said linton 
oh did not you 
but it war said i know very well and by more than one 
for miss goodbye told miss sparks that nobody in their senses could expect mr fears to give up a woman like miss norton with thirty thousand pen to her fortune by lucy steeple that had nothing at all 
and i had it from miss sparks myself 
and besides that my cousin richard laid himself that when it came to the point he was afraid mr ferrets would be off 
and when edward did not come near mul for three days i could not tell what to think myself 
and i believe in my heart lucy gave it all up for lost 
for we came away from your brother's w day and we saw nothing of him not all thursday friday and saturday and did not know what was become with him 
once lucy to hit to write to him but then her spirit rose against that 
however this morning he came just as we came home from church 
and then it all came out how he had been sent for wednesday to harley-street and been talked to by his mother and all of them and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but lucy and nobody but lucy’would he have 
and how he had been so worried by what passed that as soon as he had went away from his mother s house he had got upon 10 his horse and rid into the country somewhere or other 
and how he had said about at an inn all thursday and friday on purpose to get the better of it 
and after thinking it all over and over again he said it seemed to him as if now he had no fortune and no nothing at all it would be quite unkind to k her on lo the engagement because it must be for her on for he had nothing but two thousand pounds and no hope of anything else 
and if he was to go into orders as he had some thoughts he could get nothing but a curacy and how was they 18 sense and sensibility 
to live upon that 
— he could not bear to think of her doing no better and so he begged if the had the least mind or it to ut an end to the matter directly and lave him to sh for himself 
i heard him say all thin as plain as could possibly be 
and it was entirely for mr sake and upon bar account that he laid a word about being off and not in n his own 
i will take my oath he never drop a style able of being tired of her or of wishing to marry miss norton or anything like it 
but to be sure lucy would not ever ear to such kind of talking 
so she told him directly y with a great deal about sweet and love you know and all that 
oh in 
one can't repeat such kind of things you know 
— she told him directly the had not the least mind in the world to be off for she could live with him upon such a trifle and how little over he might have she should be very glad to have it all you know or something of the kind 
so then he was monstrous ha by and key on some time about what the shoal do and they agreed he should take orders directly and they must wait to be married till he got a living 
and not then i could not hear any more for my cousin ca ed from below to tell me mrs richardson was come in her coach and would take one of us to kensington gardens 
so i was forced to go into the room and interest them to ask lucy if she would like to go but she did not care to leave toward 
to i just run pain and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the richardson d i do not understand what you mean by interrupting them said linton 
b you were all in the same room together were not you i 
d no indeed 
not us 
la 
miss dashed do you think people make love when anybody else is by 
oh 
for shame 
— to be sure you must know better than that 
laughing aﬂ'ectedly 
— no no 
they were sense and sensibility 
1000 shut up in the drawing-room together and all i heard was only by listening at the door a how i a cried linton 
d have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door 
i am only did not know it before 
for i certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself 
how could you behave so unfairly by your sister 
a job la 
there is nothing in its 
i only stood at the door and heard what could 
and am sure lucy would have done us the same by me 
for a year or two back when martha sha and i had on many secrets together she never ma any bones of hiding in s closet 
or behind i chimney-board on to hear what we sat a line tried to talk of something else 
but miss steel could not be kept beyond a couple of minute 
from what was uppermost in her mind 
a edward talks of going to oxford soon a said she a but now he is lodging at no 
— 
pall mall 
what an ill-natured woman his mother is a n't she and your brother and sister were not very kind however i shan't say anything against them to you and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot which was more than i looked for 
and for my part i was all in fright for fear your sister should ask us for the housewife she had gave us a day or two before 
but however nothing was said about them and i took care to keep mine out of sight 
edward have got some burn 
nets at oxford he says so he must go there for a time and after tale as soon as he arm light upon a bishop he will be ordained 
i wonder what curacy he will get l 
good gracious 
gurgling as she spoke i d lay my life i know what in cousins will say when they hear of it 
they will tell me i should write to the ho sense and sensibility 
doctor to get edward the cure of his new living 
i know they will 
but i am cure would not do inch 3 thing for all the world 
— leal shall any directly d i wonder how you could think of such a thing 
i write uniiuthedoctor indeed 
2 a well a said linton 
it is a comfort to be prepsar‘ed’agninst the worn 
you have got your answer it y 
miss steel was going to reply on the same subject but the approach of her own party made another more necessary 
oh la 
here come the richardson 
i had a vast deal more to say to you but i must not stay away from them not an longer 
i assure you they are very genteel people 
e makes a monstrous deal of money a and they keep their own coach 
i have not time to walk to mrs penning about it myself but pray tell her am quite happy to hear she in not in anger against us and lady middleton the same 
and if nothing should happen to take you and your sister away and mrs penning could want company i am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes 
i suppose lady middleton wo n't ask iii any more thin bout 
good-bye 
i am sorry miss marian was not here 
remember me kindly to her 
la 
if you have not got your best spotted muslin only 
i wonder you was not afraid fit being torn such was her parting concern 
for after thin the had time only to pay her farewell comer linen to mrs joining before her company was met by mrs ruffian and linton was left in possession of knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time though she had learnt v little more than what had been already foreseen andellhre-planned in her own mind 
towards marriage with lucy was i firmly determined on and the time of its taking place remained sense and sensibility 
l l l as absolutely uncertain as she had concluded it would be 
— everything depended exactly after her expectation on his stating that preference of which at present there seem not the smallest chance 
as soon as they remained to the carriage mrs penning was eager for information 
but a linton wished to read as little as possible intelligence that had in the best place been so unfairly chained she concerned herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars as she felt assured that lucy for the sake of her own consequence would chase to have known 
the continuance of their engagement and the means that were to be taken for provoking its end was all her communication 
and this preach from mrs joining the following natural remark 
wait for his having a living l 
ay we all know how that will end 
— 
the will wait a twelvemonth and ending no good comes of it will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds year with the interest of his two thousand pounds and what little matter mr steeple and mr prattle can give her 
— then they will have a child every year and lord help em how poor they will be 
i must see what i can give them towards furnishing their house 
two maids and two men indeed l 
as i talked of other day 3 no no they must get a. stout girl of all worked 
yes sister would never do for than new 
the next morning brought minor a letter by the penny post from lucy herself 
it was as follows 
bunc-rr’s burns manly 
i hope my dear miss touchwood will excuse the liberty take of waiting her hut i know your friendship ormewillmake you pleatedwhearsuchs account of myself and my dear edward alter the trouble we have went through lately therefore will make i i 
sense and sensibility 
no more apologize but proceed to say that thank god 
though have suffered dreadfully we are both quite well now and as happy as we must always be in one another's love 
we have had great trials and greet persecutions but however at the same time gratefully acknowledge many friends yourself not the least among them whose great kindness i shall always thankfully remember as will edward too who i have mid of it 
i am sure you will be glad to hear as likewise dears penning spent two happy flirts with him yesterday afternoon he would not hear of our parting though earnestly did i as i thought my duty required urge him to it for prudence sake and would have parted for 
ever on the spot would he consent to it 
but he said it should never be he did not regard his mother s anger while he could have my affections 
our prospects are not very bright to be sure but we must wait and for the best 
he will be ordained shortly and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to anybody that has a living to bestow am verdure you will not forget us and dear mrs penning too trust the will break a good word for us to sir john or mr palmer or any friend that may be able to assist us 
poor tanner was much to blame for what she did but she did it for the best so i my nothing 
hope mrs penning went think it too much trouble to give us a call should she come this way any morning would be a great kindness and my cousins would be proud to know hen 
my paper reminds me to conceal e and begging to be most gratefully and respect remembered to her and to sir john and lady middleton and the dear children when you chance to see them and love to miss marriage i am 1802 31 
as soon as linton had wished it she performed what the concluded to be its waters real design by sense and sensibility 
of placing it in the hand of mrjenninge who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and pride 
a very well indeed l 
how pretty the write l 
eye that was quite pro r to let him be off if he would 
that at like no 
— poor ill i with i could at him a living with all my beam 
she calls me deer in evenings you lee

that sentence iaveryprettilytumed

you my dear for throwing it me 
it in m pretty s letter at ever i saw and does lucy head and heart great credit

he mun duhwoode had now been rather more than two months in town and mariner in silence to be one increased every day 
she sighed r the air the li retty the quiet of the country 
and fancied that if apace could give her eye barton must do it 
linton was hardly lean anxious than herself for their removal and o y so much lea bent on in being effected immediately at that the was conscious of the ‘ﬂicnltiet of so long a journey which marian could not be brought to acknowledge 
she began however seriously to turn her thoughts toward it accord lichens and had already mentioned their without their kind hostess who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good-will when a plan wan suggested which though declining them from home yet i few weeks longer 
poured w elixir altogether much more eligible than any other 
the painters were to remove to levelled about the end of march for the ear ii

— 
hurt it was enforced with so much real politeness by mr palmer himself an joined to the very great monument of hit manners towards them since her inner had been known to be unhappy induced her to accept it with pleasure 
when the told marian what the had done however her first reply was not very auspicious

she cried with great agitation 
d no i can not go to cleveland.” b you forget a aid elixir gently that its duration in not

— i cannut go into somerccuhirc 
— l‘hcrt, when i looked forward to going 
no linton you can not expect me to go there linton would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming inch feelings 
— the only endeavoured to connect them by working on other 
— and represented it therefore an a measure which would ix the time of her returning to that dear mother whom the to much wished to see in a more eligible more comfortable manner than any other plan could do and perhaps without any greater delay

a mariner affection for her mother was sincere it mun triumph with little difficulty over the imaginary evil the had started 
aims and snusmu’rv 
150 mrs penning was so far from being weary of her guests that she pressed them vary earnestly to return with her again in levelled 
linton s grateful for the attention but it could not alter their design 
and their mothers occurrence being radius everything relax ve to their return was an as far as it could be 
— and marian found some re off in drawing a a statement of the hours that were yet in divide her morn barton 
a ah colonel i do not know what you and i shall do without the miss dashwoods 2 
was mrs penning s address to him when he first called on her after their leaving her was settled 
— a for they are quite resolved upon long home from the painters 
— and how forlorn we shall be when i come back i 
lord 
we shall sit and be at one another as dull as two cats 
perhaps mrs penning was in hopes by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui to provoke him to make that offer which might give himself an escape from it 
and if so she had soon afterwards good reason to drink her object gained 
for on elinor’s moving to the window to me more ax obviously the dimensions of n rift which she was going to co y for her friend he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning and conversed with her there for several minutes 
the effect of this discourse on the lady too could not escape her observation 
for though the w too honourable to listen and had even changed her seat on purpose that she i t not hear to one close by the planoforte on which dinner was playing she could not k herself from seeing that linton changed colour attend ed with agitation and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment 
still farther in confirmation of her in the interval of marian's turning from one lesson to another some words of the colonel inevitably reached her ear in which he seemed to be apologise 60 skins and sensibility 
for the hardness of his house 
this let the matter beyond a doubt 
she wondered indeed at his thinking it necessary to do no 
— but supposed it to be the paper coquette 
what linton said in reply the co d not diuingniah but just ed from the motion of her lip 
that the did not think i i any material objection 
— and mrs penning commended her heart never r being so honest 
they then talked on for few minutes longer without her catching a syllable when another lucky top in marianne’a performance brought her these words in the colonel m voice 
d i am afraid it can not take place very soon 
astonished and shocked at so flower-like o speech she was almost ready to cry out a lord 
what could hinder it 
— hut checking her desire concerned herself to thin silent ejaculation 
v a this ll very strange l 
in he need not wait to be older this delay on the colonel side however did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least 
for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards and moving different ways men penning very plainly heard editor say and in a voice which showed her to feel what she said i shall always think myself very much obliged to on y mrs penning was delighted with her gratitude and on 
wondered that after hearing such a sentence the co one should be able to take leave of them as he immediately did with the utmost sang-froid and go without making her any reply l 
she had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor 
what had really paused between them was to this elect 
a l have heard said he with great companion 9 of the injustice your friend mr fears has suffered from sense and sensibility l 7 his family 3 for if i understand the matter right he has been entirely cast off by them for persevere in his engagement with a very deserving young woman 
— have i been rightly informed 
— 
is it so 
linton told him that it was 
4 the cruelty the politics cruelty he replied with great feeling 
of dividing or attempting to divide two nag peor e long ached to each other is terrible 
few does not know what she may be doing 
what she may drive her son to 
i have seen mr ferrets two or three times in harley-street and am much pleased with him 
he is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in s short time but i have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake and as a friend of yours i wish it still more 
i understand that he intended to take orders 
will you be so good as to tell him that the living of hereford now just vacant as i am informed by this day post is his if he think it worth his acceptance 
— 
but dial perhaps so unfortunately circumstance as he is now it may be nonsense to appear to doubt 
i only wish it were more valuable 
— 
it is n rectory but a small one 
the late incumbent i believe did not make more than 200 und per annum and though it is certainly capable of improvement i fear not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income 
such as it is however my lesson in presence him to it will be very great 
ray assure him of it linor’s.asmnlshment at this commission could hardly have been greater had the colonel been really making her an offer of his hand 
the presentment which only two day s before she had considered as hopeless for edward was already provided to enable him to many 
— and the of all people in theory was fixed on to bestow it 
her emotion was such as mrs penning had attributed to a very different cause g 
but whatever 18 sense and sensibility 
minor feelings less pure less pleasing might have a share in that emotion her esteem for the general benevolence and her gratitude for the vulgar friendship which together romped colonel grandson to this act were strongly ell and warmly expressed 
she thanked him for it with all her hem spoke of edward principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure if it were really his wish to put of no agreeable on alice to no er 
but at the same time she could not help than that no one could so well perform it at himself 
t was an office in short from which unwilling to give edward the pain of receiving an oblivion from her the would have been very glad to be spared herself 
— but colonel branded on motives of equal delicacy declining it likewise still seemed so desirous of its nag given through her means that she would not on any account make farther of position 
edward she believed was still in town an fortunately she had heard his address from miss steel 
she could undertake therefore to inform him of it in the course of the day 
after this had been settled colonel grandson began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour 
and times it was that he mentioned with regret that the house was small and indifferent 
— an evil which linton as mrs penning had supposed her to do made very light of at least as far as regarded its size 
the smallness of the house said the d i can not imagine my inconvenience to them for it will be in pro motion to their family and income 
y which the colonel was surprised to and that be was considering their mania e an the certain consequence of the presentation

— at east i am afraid it can not take place ve noon such was the sentence which when misunderstood so justly offended the delicate feeling of more runnings

there are not many men who would act as he has done 
few people have to compose a heart 
i never was more astonished in my life lord 
my dear you are ve modest 
i on the lean astonished at it in the wor d for i have often thought of late 
there was nothing more likely to happen 
b you judged from your knowledge of the colonel general benevolence 
but at lean you could not foresee that the opposite would so ve noon occur 2 importunity

once made up his mind in web a thing oonxchow or other he will soon and an opportunity 
well my dear i with you joy of it again and again 
and if ever there war a happy couple in the world i think i shall won know where to look for them 
b you mean on go to hereford after them i suppose said linton with a faint nile 
maybe my dear that i do indeed 
and up to the house being a bad one i do not know what the colonel would be at for it in as good a one as ever i saw a he kept fit being out of are “wellzmand whose fault is that 
why do n't he repair it p 
who could do it but himself 
a they were interrupted by the servants coming in to announce the carriage being at the door 
and my penning immediate preparing to go laid 
well my dear must be gone before i have had half my talk out 
but however we may have it all sense and sensibility 
2 
over in the evening for we shall be quite alone 
i do not ah you to go with me for i dare lay your mind in too full of the matter to care for company 
and besides you must long to tell your sister all about it begmarianne had left the room before the conversation an 
a certainly madam i shall tell marian of it 
but i shall not mention it at present to anybody else a oh l very well mid man leaning rather disappointed 
a then you would not have me tell it lucy for i think of going as far at bottom 00-day.” no marian not even lucy if you please 
one day delay will not he ve material 
and till i have written to mr fear i think it ought not to be mentioned to anybody else 
i shall do be directly 
it of income that no time should be lost with him for he will of count have much to do relative to his ordination this ech at tint puzzled mr. penning exceedingly 
y mr terror was to be written to about it in ouch a hurry she could not immediately come reread 
a few moments reflection however produced a very c hampden and the exclaimed 
a h hole indeed you 
mr fear is to be the man 
well so much the better for him 
a to before he mun be ordained in reading 
and am .verygladm and things are so forward between you 
but my deer in not thin rather out of character 
should not the colonel write'himeelf 
sure he in the r no light dot quite understand the beginning of man jenninge’l speech 
neither did he think it worth inquiring into 
and therefore only replied to in confusion 
a colonel grandson is co delicate a man that he rather wished any one to announce his intention to mr f error than himself 12s sees 
and sensibility 
and so you are forced to do it 
well be is an odd kind of delicacy 
however i will not disturb ou stain her ring to write 
you know an concerns of good-bye my dear 
i of 
not heard of anything to please me so well since chariot was brought to bed 
and away she went but returning again in a moment 
d i have been thinking of bottles sister my dear 
should be very glad to get her so good a mistress 
but whether she would do for a lady maid i am sure i can't tell 
she is an excellent housemaid and works very well at her needle 
however you will think of all that at your leisure 
certainly madam d replied linton not hearing much of what she said and more anxious to he alone than to he mistress of the subject how she should begin 
how she should expect herself in her note to edward was now all her concern 
the particular circumstances between them made a dislike my of that which to any other person would have been the easiest thing in the world 
but she equally feared to say too much or too little and t deliberating over her paper with the n in her hand till broken in on the entrance of e ward himself 
e had met mr penning s at the door in her way to the carriage us he came to cave his farewell curd 
and the after apologise for not returning herself had obliged him to enter h saying that minx dashed was above and wan to speak with him on very particular business 
linton had just been congratulating herself in the midst of her perplexity that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth when her visitor entered to force her upon this greatest sense and sensibility 
12th exertion of all 
her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance 
she had not seen him before since his engagement became public and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted with it 
which with the consciousness of 
what she had been thinking of and what she had to tell him made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes 
he too was much distressed and they sat down together in a most promising state of embarrassment 
whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming into the room he could not recollect 
but determining to he on the safe side he made his 31 logy in form us soon as he could say anything other in no a chair 
a mrs penning told me a said he a that you wished to speak with me at least i understood her so 
or i certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner 
though at the some time i should have been extremely sorry to leave london without seeing you and your sister 
especially as it will most likely be some time 
it is not probable that i should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again 
i go to oxford tomorrow 
b you would not have gone however said linton recovering herself and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible d without received in our good wishes even if we had not been able to give them in person 
mrs penning was quite right in what she said 
i have something of consequence to inform you of which i was on the point of communicating by paper 
i am charged with a most agreeable office breathing rather faster than usual on she spoke 
colonel grandson who was here only ten minutes ago has desired me to say that understanding you mean to take orders he has great pleasure in offering you the living of demand now must vacant and only wishes it were more valuable 
a w me to coom you on 249 sense and sensibility 
having no respectable and well-judged a friend and to join in his with that the living 
it up about two hundred years 
were much more considerable and such as might better enable you w 
a might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself 
ouch in short a might establish ill your views of happiness 
what edward felt n he could not any it himself it can not be expected that any one else would lay it for him 
he noted all the astonishment which ouch unexpected which such unthought-of inforrnan'on could not fail of exciting 
but he said only these two words 
a colonel random 
d a year a continued elixir gathering more revolution 
a tome of the worst was over 
colonel grandson mean it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately for the cruel situation in which the injustice c conduct of your family has placed you 
a concern which i am cure marian myself and ill your friend 
must share 
and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character and his part arc approbation of your behaviour on the prevent occasion 
colonel grandson give me a living 
— can it he 
the unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to and friendship anywhere d no a replied he with in den consciousness not to and it in you for i can not be ignorant that to you to your goodness i owe it all 
i feel it 
would expect it if i could 
but as you well know i am no orator.” b you are very much mistaken 
i do nature you that you owe it entirely at least almost entirely to your own merit and colonel abandons discontent of it 
i have had no hand in it 
i did not even know till i understood his design that the living was vacant 
nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have inch 3 living in sense and senility 
as his as a friend famine ofmyfsrnil heavy lamps 
indeed i know he but still greater p ensure in throwing it 
but upon my word you owe nothing to my limitation 
truth obliged her to acknowledge some mall share in the action 
but she was it the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefach’ess of edward that she acknowledged it with hesitation 
which probably contributed to ax that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it 
for a short time he sat deep in thought after linton had ceased to speak 
at last as if it were rather an effort he said 
a colonel grandson seems a man of great worth and nobility 
i have always heard him spoken of as mr and your brother i know esteem him highly 
he is undoubtedly a sensible man and in his manners perfectly the gentleman 
a indeed a replied elixir d i believe that you will find him on farther acquaintance all that you have heard him to be 
and a will be suchverynear neighbours for i understand the parsonage is almost close to the manor-house it is particular y important that he should be all this edward made no answer 
but when she had turned away her head gave her a look so serious so earnest so cheerful as seemed to say that he might hereafter with the distance between the parsonage the mansionhouse much greater 
a colonel grandson i think lodged in st james'sstreet d said he soon afterwards rising from his chair 
linton told him the number of the house 
i must hurry away then to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give you 
assure him first he has made me a very 
an exceedingly happy man 
linton did not offer to detain him 
and they parted 226 sons and snusxan-v 
withsveryeamestassuraneeon beside heroes 
in 
good wishes for his happiness in everything of situation that might befall him 
on in with rather an attempt to return the me good-will than the power of expressing it 
2 when i see him again said linton to herself is the door shut him out i shall see him the husband of lucy 
and with this pleasant anticipation she sat down to reconsider the the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of edward 
and of course to reflect on her own with discontent 
when mrs penning came home though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before and of whom therefore she must have a got deal to say her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession than by anything else that she reverted to it again as soon as linton appeared 
well my dear d she cried i sent a up the young man 
did not i do right 3 
an i suppose you had no great difficulty 
— you did not and him very unwilling to accept your proposal 2 d no marm 
that was not very likely well and how soon will he be ready i 
for it seems all to depend upon that a 
really if linton i know so little of these kind of forms 
that i can hardly even conjecture as to the time or the preparation necessary 
but i suppose two or three months will complete his ordimtion.’ a two or three months 
a cried my penning 
a lord 
my dear how calmly you talk of it and can the colonel wait two or three months 
lord bless me 
— i am sure it would ut me quite out of patience 
— and though one would very glad to do a kindness by poor mr f ran i do think it is not word while to wait two or three months for him 
sure somebody sense and sensibility 
v 27 else might be found that would do a well 
somebody that is in order a y 
a my dear madam d said linton that can you be think of i 
why colonel abandons only object is to be use to mr ferry 
a lord bless you my dear l sure you do not mean to persuade me that the colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to mr fears 4 the deception could not continue after this 
and an explanation immediately took place by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment without an material loss of ha less to either for mrs penning exchanged one arm of delight for another and without forgetting her expectation of the list 
maybe aye the age is but annals one said she after the first em 
of surprise and satisfaction was over and very likely may be out of repair 
but to hat a man a lodging as i thought for house that to my know ye has ever sitting-rooms on the ground-floor and i think the house r told me could make fifteen beds 
and to you to that had been used to live in barton cottage 
it decade quite ridiculous 
— but my clear we must touch up the colonel to do something to the parsonage and make it comfortable for them before lucy goes to it but colonel grandson doe not seem to have any a ideas of the divine being enough to allow them to i 
e colonel lo i ninny my dear 
because he has two thousand years himself he thinks that nobody else can many on lea 
take my word for it that if i am alive i shall be paying a visit at eyford parsonage before michaelmas 
and i am sure i shan't go if lucy not there 
e nor was quite out of her opinion no to the proof ability of their not waiting for anything more 
us sense umf murmur 
chapter 19 
toward having arrived hit thanks to colonel grandson proceeded with his next to lucy 
and such war the excess of it y the time he reached barthens building 
that the was able to nature men penning who called on her again the next day with her congratulation that the had never seen him in such spirit before in her life 
her own happiness and her own spirit were at least very certain 
and the pointed mrs penning most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in eyford parsonage before michaelmas so far what the at the tame time from any backwardness to give linton that credit which edward would give her that the spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth was ready to own all that obligation to her and openly declared that no exertion for their good on miss dashed s rest either pretext or future would ever surprise her or the believed her capable of doing anything in the world for those the really valued 
as for colonel grandson the was not only ready to worship him at a saint but was moreover thin anxious that he should be treated at one in all worldly concerns 
anxious that his titles should be raised to the moon 
and secretly resolved to avail herself at eyford as far as the post could of hit servant hive carriage his cows and hit poultry 
it was now above a week since john earth had called in berkeley-street and at trance that time no notice had been taken by them of his wife indisposition beyond one herbal inquire editor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit 
— his was an obligation however which not only opposed her own inclination but which had not the pittance of any encouragement sense and sensibility 
2 from her companions 
marian not contented with absolute refusing to go herself was very urgent to prevent er sister's going at all 
and mrs penning though her carriage was alway 
at elinor’s service so very much disliked my john wood that not even her curiosity to peel how she looked after the late discovery nor her strong desire to affront her by taking edward part could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again 
the consequence was that linton set out by herself to pay a visit for which no one could really have less inclination and to run the risk of a téteeis-téu with a woman whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike 
mr 
wood was denied 
but before the carriage could turn from the house her husband accidents y 
came out 
he expressed great pleasure in meeting linton told her that he had been going to all in berkeley-street and assuring her that fanny would be glad to lee her invited her to come in hey walked up stain into the drawing-room 
nobody was there 
a fanny is in her own room i suppose a said he 
— d i will go to her presently for i am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing you 
very far from it indeed 
now especially there can not be 
but however on and marian were any great favourite 
by would not marian come 
a linton made whet excuse she could for her 
a i am not sorry to ice you alone a he replied a for ihaveagooddealtosaytoyou 
thislivingof colonel brandon’hnn it be two l 
has he really given it to edward l 
i heard it yesterday by chance and was coming to you on purpose to inquire farther but it a it in thy true 
— colonel branch has given the living of hold to edward ii 
i 30 sense and sensibility 
a really l 
well this is very astonishing 
— 
no relationship l 
no connection between them l 
end now that living fetch such a price l 
what was the value of this ll a about two hundred a 
year 
a very well 
and for the next pretensions to a living of that value 
m dosing the late incumbent to have been old and since y and like to vacated it soon 
he might have got i dare say 
green hundred pounds 
and how came he not to have settled that matter before this persons death i 
now indeed it would be too late to sell it but a man of colonel abandons sense 
— i wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common such natural concern 
— 
well i am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character 
i suppose however 
on recollection 
— that the case may probably be his 
edward is only to hold the living til the person to whom the colonel has really sold the presentation is old enough to take it 
— 
e aye that is the fact depend upon it 
e nor contradicted it however very positively 
and by relating that she had herself been employed ed in conveying the other from colonel grandson to ward and to re must understand the terms on which it was given obliged him to submit to her authority 
a it is truly astonishing 
— he cried after what she said 
a what could be the colonel motive 
a very simple one 
to be cause to mr foreman 
well well 
whatever colonel grandson may be edward is a very lucky man 
you will not mention the manner to faun however 
for though i have broke it to her and she it mostly well she will not like to hear it much talked of 
linton had some difficulty here to refrain from observing that the thought fanny might have home with composure an acquisition of wealth to her brother sense and sensibility 
3 
by which neither the nor her child could be penny impoveriahed 
a mrs fear a added he lowering his voice to the tone becoming so important a d know 
nothing about it at present and i believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long an my be 
— when the marriage takes place i fear she must hear of it all 
a but wh should such precaution be used i 
though it is not to supposed that mrs fear can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son hae money enough to live upon 
— for but must be quite out of the question 
yet wh after her late behaviour is she supposed to feel at all 
he has done with her son she haunt him of 
for ever and has made all those over whom she had any influence cast him off likewise surely after doing on she can not be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account 
she can not be interested in anything that befall him 
she would not be an weak as to throw away the comfort of a child and retain the anxiety of a parent 
d a ah linton said john your reasoning is very but it is founded on ignorance of human nature 
hen edward unhasp match takes place depend upon it his mother will l as much as if she had never discarded him 
and therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event 
must be concealed from her on much as possible 
mrs fear can never forget that edward in her in 
you surprise me 
i could think it must nearly have escaped her memory by hi time 
you wrong her exceedingly 
mrs fears is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world a linton was silent 
2 we think am a said mr dashed after a short paused a of forty marrying miss norton 120 sense and sensibility 
linton milking at the grave and deceive importance of her brothers tone calmly replied 
— a the lady i suppose has no choice in the affair 
chance l 
how do a mean t d i only mean that supposed from your manner of taking it must be the lame to mill norton whether an marry edward or robert certainly there can be no dill'crcncc 
for robert will now to all intent and purpose be considered an the eldest son 
and an to anything else they are both very agreeable young men 
li do not know that one in superior to the other linton said no more and john was also for a than time silent 
his relations ended thur 
of one thing my dear sister a kindly taking her hand and taking in an awful whisper a i may assure you and will do it because i know it must gras you 
i have good reason to think 
indeed i have it from the heat authority or i should not repeat it for otherwise it would be very wrong to my anything about it 
but i have from the very heat authority 
not that i ever precisely heard mimic forrard lay it herself but her daughter told and i have it from her 
that in short whatever objection 
there might be against a certain 
a certain connection 
you understand rue 
it would have been far preferable to her it would not have her half the vexation that ill dust 
i wan exceedingly pleased to hear that mr f mare considered it in that light 
4 very gratifying circumstances you know to up all 
a it would have been beyond companion d she aid the lean evil of the two and she would be glad to compound now for nothing woman but however all that in quite out of the question 
not to be thought of or mentioned 
an to any attachment you know 
it never could he 
all that a gone by 
but i thought i would jump tell you of this became i knew how much sense and sensibility 
31 it must please you 
not that you have any son to regret my dear linton 
there is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well 
quite as well or better perhaps all thin i considered 
has colonel grandson been with you la y it nor had heard enough if not to gratify her vanity and raised her self-importance to agitate her nerves and all her mind 
and she was therefore glad to be red from the necessity of saying much in reply herself and from the danger of hearing anything more from her brother by the entrance of mr robert forrard 
after a few moments chant john dmihwood recollecting that fanny was yet informed of his sister being there quitted the room in nest of her 
and linton was left to improve her acquaintance with robert who by the gay unconcern the ha by self-complacent of his manner while enjoying so a air a division of his mother s love and liberality to the prejudice of his banished brother earned only by his own dissipated course of life and that brother integrity was concerning her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart they had scarcely been two minutes by themselves before he began to speak of edward 
for he too had heard of the living and was very inquisitive on the subject 
linton repeated the particular of it as she had given them to john and their effect on robert though very different was not less striking than it had been on binds 
he laughed most immoderately 
the idea of edward been a clergyman and living in a small parsonage-house diverted him beyond measure 
and when to that was added the fanciful image of edward reading years in a white surprise and pushing the banns of marriage between john smith and mary brown he could conceive nothing more ridiculous 
linton while she waited in silence and immovable gravity the conclusion of such folly could not remain 104 sense and seisibilh'v 
her eyelfrom being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited 
it war a look however very well bestowed liar it relieved her own feelingnand gave no intelligence to him 
he was recalled from wit to wild not by any reproof hen but by hi 
own feasibility 
we may treat it as a joke said he at lust recovering from the affected laugh which had considerable lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment 
a but a n my soul it is a most serious business 
poor end i he in mind for ever 
i an excuse sorry for it 
for i know him to be a very good-hearted creature 
at well meaning a fellow perhaps as any in the world 
you must not judge of him mine i wood from your alight acquaintance 
poor edward 
his manners are certainly not the happiness in nature 
but we are not all born you know with the lame power 
the came address 
poor fellow to ice him in a circle of strangers 
m be cure it we 
pitiable enough l 
but upon my soul i believe he ban on good a heart at any in the kingdom 
and i declare and protest to you i never wan no rocked in my life a when it all burst forth 
i could not believe it 
m mother was the list person who told me of it and feeling myself called on to act with resolution immediately aid to her a m dear madam i do not know what on may intend to m on the occasion 
but up for myself i must ray that if edward doe marry thinning woman i never will ace him again that wan what i laid immediately 
— i wan most uncommonly checked indeed l 
poor reward 
he hat done for himself completely e 
shut herself out for ever from all decent society l 
but an i directly aid to my mother i am not in the lean surprised at it

my poor mother was half frantic

while the was staying in this home 
i happened to drop in for ten minutes 
and i saw quite enough of her

i remember her perfectly

i suffered immediately up soon in mother related the affair to me w to him myuelfﬁnd dissuade him from the lunch

t had i been informed of it a few hourearlier i think it in most probable that something might have been hit on 
i certainly should have resented it to edward a very strong light 
my ear fellow d i should have laid considered what you are doing 
you are making a molt disgraceful connection and such i one an your family are unanimous in disapprovingly i can not help drinking in short that means might have been found but now it is all too late 
he knelt be carved you know 
that in certain 3 absolutely meed 
he had settled this point with m 
composure when the entrance of mrs john dashed put an end to the subject 
but though as never spoke of it out of her own family linton could lee its influence on her mind in the something like confusion of countenance with which he entered in an attempt at cordiality in he behaviour to herself 
she even proceeded to fur up to be concerns to and that linton and her under wereloloonrolenvetown all end toffee more of them 
an exertion in which her h and who attended her into the room and hung rumoured over her account seemed to distinguish everything that was most nﬁ'ectiomte end graceful 
ran sense 
urn smasher 
than 1883 ne other short call in harley-meet in which linton received her brother congratulation 
on their travelling no fur toward barton without any expense and on colonel abandons being to follow them to clare-land in a day or two completed the intercourse of the brother and like in town 
and a faint invitation from fanny to come to scotland whenever it should happen to be in their way which of all thing war the most unlikely to occur with a more warm though lens public assurance from john to linton of the ram attitude with which he could come m in her at mr was all that foretold any meeting in the country 
it amuses her to observe that all her friend leaned determined to send her to hereford 
a place in which fell others she would now least chase to visit or wish to reside 
for not only was it considered on her future home by her brother and my penning but even lucy when they parted gave her a pledge invitation to visit her there 
very early in april and tolerate early in the day the two parties from hanover-iquare and berkeleyrtreet act out from their respective hoile to meet by a intent on the road 
for the convenience of marlott and her child they were to be more than two day on their journey and mr palmer travelling more ax furiously with colonel grandson wan to join them at levelled noon after their arrival 
marian few a had been her hours of comfort in london and eager at the had long been to quit it could not 
when it came to the inn bid adieu to the house in which the had for the at time enjoyed those hopes and that conscience in willoughhy which were sense and sensibility 
3 now extinguished for ever without great pain 
nor could she leave the place in which willoughby remained in new engagements and new schemes in which a could have no share 
without shedding man tears 
lords satisfaction at the moment of removal was more positive 
she had no such object for her lingering thoughts to ax on she left no mature behind from whom it would give her a moment regret to be divided for ever she was pleased to be free herself from the mention of luck friendship she was grateful for urging her sister away unseen by willoughhy since his marriage and she looked forward with hope to what a few months of tranquillity at barton i t do towards restoring marian's peace of mind concerning her own 
their journey was safely performed 
the second day brought them into the cherished or the prohibition county of sombre for as such was it dwelt on by turns in marian's imagination 
and in the foreman of the third they drove up to levelled 
levelled was a spacious modem-built house situated on a sloping lawn 
it had no park but the pleasuregmunds were tolerate extensive 
and like every other place of the same degree of importance it had its open robbery and closer wood-work 
a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation led to the front 
the lawn was dotted over with timber 
the house itself was under the guardianship of the or the mountains and the scotia and a dual screen of them altogether interspersed with tall lordy poplar shut out the offices 
marian entered the house with an heart swelling with emotion from the consciousness of being only i try miles from barton and not thirty from combe gun 
and before she had been ever minutes within 3 sense and sensibility 
its walls while the there were busily helping chariot knew her child to the house-keeper the quitted it stealing away through h the winding ihmbberiel now jug being to be in duty to gain a dime eminence 
where from its grecian temple her eye wandering over a wide me of country to the south-east could fondly rest on the furthest ridge of hills in the horizon and army that from their summits combe magic might be seen 
in such moments of precious of invaluable he rejoiced in tears of agony to be at levelled 
and as the returned by a different circuit to the house feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty of wandering from lace to place in free and luxurious solitude she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained with the palm in the indulgence of such solitary rambles 
she returned just in time to join the other as they quitted the house on an excursion through its more immediate premises 
and the rent of the morning was easily whiled away in lounging round the kitchen garden examining the bloom upon its walls and listening to the gardener s lamentation upon blight

she found him however 140 sense and sensible 
exactly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitor and only occasionally me to his wife and her mother 
she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion and only prevented from being so always by too great an attitude to fancy himself as much superior to people in general as he must feel himself to be to re penning and charlie 
for the nest of his character and habits they were marked as far as linton could receive with no trails at all unusual in his sex an time of life 
he was nice in his eating uncertain in his hours 
fond of his child though affecting to slight it 
and died away the mornings at pillars which ought to have been devoted to business

he tried to moon him out of fear which the different judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd

towards the evening marian became ill again growing more heavy rest less and uncomfortable than before

and carefully 2 ministering the cordial prescribed saw her with satisfaction wink at last into a slumber from which the expected the most beneficial effects 
hardened though not so quiet as linton wished to see it lasted a considerable time 
and anxious to observe the result of it herself she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it 
my penning knowing nothing of any change in the patient went unusually early to bed 
her maid who was one of the principal nursed was creaking herself in the housekeeper room and linton remained alone with marian 
the repose of the latter became more and more disturbed 
and her sister who watched with unremitting attention her continual change of posture and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint which pcasedherli was almost wishing to muse terror to painful a embers when marian suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in the house tuned hastily up and with feverish wildness cried out no k 4 sense and sensible

but her difficulties were instantly obviate for with i readiness that yearned to speak the occasion and the service rearranged in his mind he offered himself up the messenger who should fetch my wood 
linton made no radiance that was not easily overcome 
she tucked him with a brief though fervent gratitude and while he went to hurry of his earth with a steeple to mr harris and an order for pan-honee direct ill wrote a few line to her mother the comfort of such a friend at that moment an colonel grandson

her apprehensions once mailed paid by their excess for all her former security and the servant who at up with her for she would not allow man leaning to be called only tortured her more by hint of what her had always than t 
hg'ianne’s ideas were still at intervals vexed incoherent on her mother and whenever she mentioned her name it gave a pang to the heart of poor linton who marching herself for having tried with man days mum and wretched for some immediate relief fancied that all relief might soon he in vain that everything had been delayed too long and pictured to herself her entering mother arriving too late to see that darling child 
or to see her rational 
she was on the point of sending again for mr harris 18 suds and smsrnxurv 
or if be could not come for some other advice when the former 
but not till after ever o'clock

his opinion however made tome little amends for his deal for though acknowledgment a very unexpected and up pageant alteration in his patient he would not allow the danger to be material and talked of the relief which n force mode of treatment matt procure with a confidence which in a lover degree we communicated to linton 
he promised to call again in the come of three or four hours and left both the paint and her anxious attendant more composed thanked found them 
with strong concern and with man approaches for not being called to their aid did mr gunga hear in the morning of what had patted 
her former apprehemiooa now with greater moon restored left her no doubt of the event 
— and though trying to speak comfort to linton her conviction of her iittet’t danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope

and no for their mother when mrs penning considered that marriage might probably be to bar what chariot van to herself her sympathy in her offering was very sincere 
mr harris wan punctual in his second visit

he had still something more to try come fresh application of whose scene he was almost a comment on the inn and his visit concluded with encouraging instances which reached the ear but could not enter the hem of mice dead-wood 
she wan calm 
except when he thought of her mother but the was almost hopeless 
and in this rate she continued till noon scarcely stirring from her sister s bed her thoughts wandering from one image of grief one suffering friend to another and her spirit oppressed to the utmost by the constant of mrs penning who crumpled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous disposition which marian's disappointment had brought on 
linton felt all the reuonableness the idea and it gave fresh misery her reflection 
about noon however a the began 
— but with a caution i dread of some disappointment which for some time kept her silent even to her friend 
to fancy to hope she could perceive a alight amusement in her after i pulse 
— she waited watched examined it again and again 
— and at it with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness than all her foregoing distress ventured to communicate her hopes 
my penning though forced on examination to acknowledge a temporary revival tried to keep her young friend from indulging a thought of it 
continuance 
and linton conning over every injunction afflict-rust told herb self likewise not to hope 
ut it was too late 
hope had already entered 
and feeling all in anxious utter the bent over her sister to watch

— when his assurance hire felicitatiom on a recovery in her lift even surpassing hit expectation gave her confidence comfort and turn of 
iiirianne was in every respect materially better and he declared her entirely out of danger 
man leaning perhapiatieﬁed with the partial justification of her forebodingly which had been found in their late alarm allowed herself to trust in his judgment and admitted with unfeigned joy and noon with unequivocal cheerfulness the probability of an entire recovery 
linton could not be cheerful 
her joy was of a different kind and led to anything rather than to gaiety 
marian rcttnrcd to life health friend and to her doctrine mother was an idea to all her head with mutations o exquisite comfort and explain it in fervent gratitude 
but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy no words no trails 
all within elinor‘a breast satisfaction talent and stung 
she continued by the side of her sister with little intention the whole afternoon calving every fear satisfying every inquiry of her enabled spirit applying every humour and watching almost every look angel every breath 
the possibility of a relapse would of course in some moments occur to remind her of what anxiety wast 
hut when the saw on her frequent and minute examination that every symptom of recovery continued and raw alliance at six o'clock sink into a quiet steady and to all a trance come ramble it the violence every doubt 
p up the time was now drawing on when colonel grandson might be expected back 
at ten o'clock the trusted or at least not much later her mother would i sense and sensibility 
150 be relieved from the dreadful an in which she mun 
now be travelling towards them

— perhaps scarcely less an object of pity l 
— old how slow was the progress of time which yet kept then in i prance 
t seven o'clock leaving marian still sweetly asleep she joined mrs joining in the drawing-room to tea 
of breakfast she had been kept by her fears and of dinner by their sudden reverse from eating much 
— and the present refreshment therefore with such feelings of content as she brought to it was particularly welcome 
mrs penning would have persuaded her at its conclusion to take some rest before her mother arrival and allow bar to take her place by marriage 
but linton had no sense of fatigue no incapability of sleep at that more about her and she was not to he sway from her sister an undue instant 
mrs penning therefore attending her up mine into the sick chamber to satisfy harberseli that all continued right left her there again to her charge and her thoughts and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep 
the night was cold and stormy 
the wind roared round the house and the main bent against the windows 
but linton all happiness within regarded it not 
marian slept through every blast and the travellers 
— they had a rich reward in store for every present inconvenience 
the clock struck eight 
had it been ten linton would have been convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the house 
and so strong was the persuasion that s m in spite of the alarm irnpossihi t of their being already come that she moved into the aid pining dressing-case and o ned a windowshutter to satisfy of the truth

d if that is all you may be satisfied already 
for marriage does 
she has long given you 
has she 
— he cried in the same eager tone 
— when she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it 
but she shall forgive me again and on more reasonable grounds 
now will you listen me 
a minor bowed her assent 
i do not know a said he after a pause of expectation on her side and thoughtfulness on his own 
a how you may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister or what diabolical motive you may have imparted to me 
perhaps you will hardly think the better of me 
it is worth the trial however and you shall her everything 
when i first became intimate in your family i had no other intention no other view in the soqumntanoe than to my time pleasantly while i was obliged to remain in devonshire more pleasantly than i had ever done before 
your sister lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me 
and her behaviour to me almost from the first was of a kind 
it is astonishing when i reflect on what i was and what the was that my heart should have been so insensible l 
but at rest i must confess my vanity only was elevated by it 
careless of her happiness thinking only of my own amusement giving way to feelings which i had always been too much in the habit of indulging i endeavoured by every means in my power to make myself pleasing to her without any design of returning her affection miss dashed at this point turning her eyes on 16a sizes and snusmu'rv

yet it is hardly worth while mr will for you to relate or for me to listen an longer 
such a begin

do not let me be pained by hearing anything more on the subject 
l s 10 d i insist on your hearing the whole of it a he replied 
a my fortune was never large and i had always been expensive always in the habit of associating with power of better income than myself 
every year since my coming of age or even before i believe had added to my d 
and though the death of my old cousin mrs smith was to set me free yet that event being uncertain and in far distant it had been for some time my intention to establish in circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune 
o attach myself to your sister therefore was not a thing to thought of 
and with a weakness selfishness cruelty 
which no indignant no contemptuous look even of yours miss dashed can ever reprobate too much 
i was acting in this manner trying to engage her regard without a thought of renewing it 
but one thing my be said for me even in that horrid state of selfish van i did not know the extent of the injury i meditate because i did not but know what it was to love 
but have 10 ever known it l 
well may it be doubted 
for had i really loved could i have sacrifice my feelings to vanity to avarice 
— or what is more could i have sacrifice hers e 
but i have done it 
to avoid i come native coventry which her affection and her society wo d have deprived of all its horrors i have by raising myself to influence lost everything that could make it a blessing b you did then a said linton a little softened 2 believe yourself at one time attached to her sense 
and swsibiwi c to have ruined such attractions to have withstood inch tenderness 
is there a man on earth who could have done it l 
yes i found myself by insensible degrees sincerely fond of her 
and the happiest hours of my life were what i spent with her when i felt my intentions were strictly honourable and m feelings blameless 
even men however when fully determined on paying my addressed to her i allowed myself root improper to put off from day to day the moment of doing it from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while m circumstances were so greatly embarrassed 
i not remain here 
nor will i up for you to expedite on the absurdity and the worst than absurdity of crumbling to engage my faith where my honour was ahead hound 
he event has proved that i was a cunning 100 providing with great circumspect for a possible of vanity of making myself couple and wretch for ever 
at last however my reed union wan taken and i had determined as noon as i could engage her alone to justify the attention had so invariably paid her and openly assure her of an affection which i had already taken such pains to display 
but in the interim 
in the interim of the very few hours that were to before i could have an opportunity of making with her in private 
a circumstance occurred an unlucky circumstance to mind all my resolution and with it all my comfort 
a discovery took lace 2 
here he hesitated and looked down mrs smith had somehow or other been informed i imagine by some distant relation whose interest it w to give me of her favour of an air a confession

she was obviously disposed i believe to doubt the morality o my conduct in general and was moreover discontented with the ve little attended the very little portion of my time that hid bestowed on her in my present visit

the struggle was great

but it ended too soon 
my affection for marriage my thorough conviction of her attachment to name 
it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches which i was natural inclined to feel and expensive society had incur 
i had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife if i chose to address her and i persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do 
an heavy scene however awaited me before i could leave devonshire 
i was engaged to dine with you on that very day some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking the engagement 
but whether i should write this a lo or deliver it in person was 3 it of long to 
to see marriage i felt would be dreadful and i even doubted whether i could see her again and keep to my resolution

the light of your dear sister however was really dreadful 
and to frighten the matter i found her alone 
you were all gone i do not know where 
i had left her only the evening before to fully 60 warmly resolved within myself on doing right 
a few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever

serpent love for mnrisnne which it was not even infinite cent to indulge

the past the recent the futurewilloughby’s visit marian's ugly and her mother expected arrival threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept of every indication of fatigue and 
ma e her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister

eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moments horrible lv pence she ran immediately into the hall and reached the outward dour just in time to receive and support her as she entered it 
mrs hood where terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of marianne’l being no more had no voice to inquire after her no voice even for linton 
but be waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry instantly gave the joyful relief 
— and her mother catching it with all her usual warmth was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness as she had been before by her fears 
she was supported into the drawing-room between her daughter and her friend and there shedding tears of joy though still unable to speak embraced linton again nod again turning from her at intervals to press 
colonel undone hand with a look which spoke at once her gratitude and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the blue of the moment 
he shared it however in e silence even greater than her own 
as soon as mrs touchwood had recovered herself to sense and sensibility

then remembering colonel grandson reproved herself felt that to bid suffering and bid constancy far more than to hit rival the reward of her sister was due and wished anything rather than mr willoughhy'l death

a yes ma'am 
but not to hide long 
they will soon he back again and then they be cure and call here mrs touchwood now looked at her daughter 
but linton knew better than to expect them 
she recognised the whole of lucy in the manage and was very confident that edward would never come near them 
she observed in a low voice to her mother that they were probably going down to mr l’ratt’l near 10 month

i was afraid of being lasted a did mrs forrard look well 2 a yes ma'am she said how she was very well 
and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady 
and she seemed vastly contented 
mrs dashed could think of no other question and thomas and the tablecloth now alike needless were soon after dismissed 
marian had already sent to say that she should eat nothing more 
mrs dashwood's and linton s appetites were equally lost and margaret might think herself very well off that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced so much reason as they had often had to be careless of the meals she had never been obliged to go without her dinner here 
when the dessert and the wine were arranged and mrs dashed and linton were left to themselves they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfiilneand silence 
mrs dashed feared to hazard any remark and ventured not to offer consolation 
she now found that she had erred in lying on elinor’s representation of herself 
and justly concluded that 
everything had been expressly softened at the time to spare her from an increase of unhappiness suffering as she then had suffered for marriage 
she found that she had been misled by the careful the considerate attention of her daughter to think the attachment which once she had so well understood 
much slighter in reality than she had been wont to believe or than it was now proved to be 
she feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust inattentive 
nay 
almost unkind to her linton 
that marian's affection because more acknowledged more immediately before her had too much engrossed her tenderness and led her away to sense and sensibility 
1801 forget that in linton she might have a daughter suffering almost as much certainly with less self-provocation a greater fortitude 
chapter ﬁll-13 
linton new found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event however sermon the mind m be told to consider it and certainty itself 
she now found that in spite of herself she had always admitted a hope while edward remained single that something would occur to prevent his marrying lucy 
that some resolution of his own some mediation of friends or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady would arise to assist the happiness of all 
but he was now married and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery which so much heightened the pain the intelligence 
that he should be married so soon before as she imagined he could be in orders and consequently before he could be in possession of the living surprised her a little at first 
but she soon saw how likely it was that lucy in her self-evident care in her haste secure him should overlook everything but the risk of delay 
they were married married in town and now hastening down to her uncle 
what had edward felt on being within four miles of barton on seeing her mother servant on hearing lucy message 
they would soon she supposed be settled at delay lord 
eyford that place in which so much conspired to give her an interest 
which she wished to be acquainted with and yet desired to avoid 
she saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house 
saw in lucy the active conceiving manager uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frivolity and ashamed h. n 4 sense and sensibhjtv 
to he expected of half mr economical practice 
— pursuing her own lantern in every thou hat owning the favour of colonel melon of my evening and of every wealthy friend 
in edward she knew not what the aw nor what the wished to see 
ham or unhappy 
nothing placed her 
— she hunted away her head from every sketch of him 
l'ilinor buttered herself that some one of their conditions in london would write to them to announce the event and give farther particulars 
but day after day passed off and brought no letter no tidings 
though uncertain that any one were to blame the found fault with every absent friend 
they were all thoughtless or indolent 
a when do you write to colonel grandson ma'am 2 a was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on 
d i wrote to him my love last week and rather expect to see than to hear from him again

he stopped at their gate 
it was it gentleman it was colonel abandons himself 
now she should hear more

but 
it was not colonel brandonuneither his air nor his height 
were it possible she should say it must be edward

he had just dismounted 
— he could not he mistaken

she moved away and sat down

i will be calm 
l will be mistress of myself sense and sensibility 
as in a moment she perceived that the other were likewise aware of the mistake 
she saw her mother and marian change colour 
saw them look at herself and whisper a few sentences to each other 
she would have given the world to be able to speak 
and to make them understand that she hoped no coolness no slight would appear in their behaviour to him 
— 
but she had no utterance and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion 
not a syllable passed aloud 
they all waited in silence for the appearance of their visitor 
his footsteps were heard along the gravel path 
in a moment he was in the passage and in another he was before them 
his countenance as he entered the room was not too happy even for linton 
his complexion was white with agitation and he looked as it fearful of his reach lion and conscious that he merited no kind one 
is dashed however confirming as she trusted to the wishes of that daughter by whom the then meant in the warmth of her heart to be guided in everything met him with a look of forced complacency gave him her hand and wished him joy 
he coloured and stammered out an unintelligible reply 
elinor’s lips had moved with her mother and when the moment of action was over she wished that the had shaken hands with him too 
but it was then too late and with a countenance meaning to be open she sat down again and talked of the weather 
marian had retreated as much as possible out of sight to conceal her distress 
and margaret understanding tome part but not the whole of the case thought it incumbent on her to he dignified and therefore took a seat as far from him as she could and maintained a afflict silence 
when linton had ceased to rejoice in the darkness of the season a very awful pause took place 
it was put 16a sense and sensibility 
an end to by my dead-wood who felt obliged to hope that he had left mrs fears very well 
in a hurried manner he replied in the affirmative 
another pause 
linton resolving to exert herself though fearing the sound of her own voice now said 
a in mr ferry 
at language 2 d at longside 
— 
he replied with an air of surprise 
d no my mother i in town d i meant if linton taking up some work from the table c to inquire after my edward ferrari.” she dared not look up 
— but her mother and marian both turned their eyes on him 
he coloured seemed perplexed looked doubtingly and after some hesitation said 
— 
perhaps you mean 
my brother 
you mean mere 
mrs rain ferrets a man robert forrard 
2 was repeated by marriage and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement 
— and though linton could not speak even per eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder 
he rose from his seat and walked to the window apparently from not knowing what to do 
took up a pair of scissors that lay there and while spilling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces an he spoke said in an hurried voice 
— a perhaps you do not know 
you may not have can that my brother is lately married 10

a. perplexity which they had no mean of learning but by their own conjecture

unaccountable however an the circumference of lull release might a or to the whole family it was certain that edward was free 
and to what purpose that freedom would be employed was fully determined by all

and want of employment 
had my mother given me come active profusion when i was removed at eighteen from the care of mr prattle i think 
nay i am sure it would never have happened 
for though i left long-tails with what i thought at the time a most unconquerable preference for his niece yet had then had any pursuit any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months i should very soon have thrown the fancied attachment especially by making more with the world an in such a cane sense and sensrmnm

instead of having any profusion chosen for me or being allowed to cause any myself i returned home to he only idle 
and for the tint twelvemonth afterward him even the nominal employment which belonging to the university would have given me for i war not entered at oxford till i was nineteen 
i had therefore nothing in the world to do 
but to fancy myself in love 
and at m mother did not make my home in every respect come enable 
as i had no friend no companion in my brother and walked new acquaintance it was not unnatural for me to be very often at constable where i always felt myself at home and was always lure of a welcome 
and accordingly i spent the tent part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen

he could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with mine wood 3 end by his rapidity in seeing that fate it in to be supposed in ten of the jealous with which he had once thought of colonel

though hi eyed 104 sense and sensibility 
been long opened even before hit acquaintance with linton began to her ignorance and a want of liberty in tome of her opinion they had been guilty imp by him to her want of education 
and till her last letter reached him he had all believed hi l to be a gal disposed good-hearted girl and though y attach to himself 
nothing but inch 31 perturbation could have prevented hit putting an end to an engagement which on before the discovery of it laid him open to hit mother anger had been 3 continual source of quiet and regret to him 
i thought it my duty d said he independent of my feelings to give her the operation of continuing the engagement or not when i war pronounced by my mother and mood to all appearance without a friend in the world to insist me 
in inch 3 agitation at that where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature how could i suppose when the to earnestly to warmly inflicted on sharing my fate whatever it might be that anything but the most disinterested affection was her-inducement 
and even now i cannut comprehend on what motive the acted or what fancied advantage it could be to her to be letters to a mind for whom the had not the smallest regard and who had only two thousand pounds in the world 
she could not forget that colonel grandson would give me i living 
s but the might suppose that something would occur in your favour 
that your own family might in time relent 
and at animate the lost nothing by continuing the engagement for the hat proved that it mattered neither her inclination nor her actions 
the conversion was certainly a respectable one and probably gained her condition among her friend 
and if nothing more advantageous occurred it would be better for her to marry you than he mingled sense and sensibility 
25 edward was of course immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than lucy on duty nor more self-evident than the motive of it 
linton scolded him harshly as ladies always scold the impnrdcnoe which compliments themselves for having spent so much came with them at normandy when he molt 
have felt his own inclemency 
your behaviour was certainly very wrong d said she d because 
to say nothing of my own conviction 
our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect warm as you were ten situated could never be he could only plead an ignorance of his own heart and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement 
d i was simple enough to think that because my faith wan delighted to another there could be no danger in my being with you 
and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred up my honour 
i felt that i admired you but i told myself it wan only friendship 
and till i began to make comparison between yourself and lucy i did not know how far i was got 
after that i cup so i mun wrong in remaining so much in sussex antixihc argument with which i mooncilcd myself to the exlmdiency of it were no better than these 
t he danger is my own i i am doing no injury to anybody but myself 
linton smiled and shook her head 
edward heard with pleasure of colonel abandons being expected at the cottage as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him but to have an opportunity of convincing him thathenolonger resented hurl giving him the living of hereford 
2 which at present a said he a after thanks ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion he must think i have never forgiven him for offering 
now he felt raised himself that he had never yet been to the place 
but so little interest had he taken in 26 sense and sensrsrurv 
the matter that he owed all his knowledge of the house garden and glees extent of the right condition of the and and rate of the witches to linton herself who had heard so much of it from colonel brandy and heard it with so much attention as to entirely mistress of the subject 
ne question after this only remained undecided between them one difficulty only was to be overcome 
they were brought together by mutual affection with the warmest zero approbation of their real friends 
their intimate knew be of each other seemed to make their happiness certain 
and they only wanted something to live upon 
edward had two thousand pounds and linton one which with delayed living was all that they could call their own 
for it was impossible that mrs touchwood should advance anything and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and my months a year would supply them with the comforts of a 
edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable chance e in his mother towards him 
and on that he rested or the residence of their income 
but linton had no such dependence 
for since edward would still be unable to marry miss portion and his choosing herself had been spoken of in mrs fen-ars’s battering language as only a lesser evil than his choosing lucy steeple she feared that robert clamor would serve no other purpose than to enrich fanny 
about four days after edward s arrival colonel grandson appeared to complete my dashwood’s satisfaction an to give her the dignity of having for the first time since her living at barton more company with her than her house would hold 
edward was allowed to retain the privilege of ﬁrst-comer and colonel grandson therefore walked every night to his old quarters at the park 
from whence he usually returned in the sense and sensibility

among ouch friend 
however and web latterly he did revive 
no rumour of luck marriage had yet reached him 
he knew nothing of what had paused and the list hour of hit visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering 
everything wan explained to him by my hood and he found fresh moon to rejoice in what he had done for mr fear since eventually it prompted the interest of minor it would be needles to nay that the gentlemen dance in the good opinion of each other a they advanced in each other acquaintance for it could not be otherwise 
their remembrance in good principle 
and good serve in dispositions end manner of thinking would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship without any other attraction 
but their being in love with two linen and two listen fond of each other made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment

poor mr edward 
i can not t him out of my head but you mun send for him to anon and miss marian coat try to comfort him mr dashwood’s strain were more solemn 
mrs ferrets was the most unfortunate of women 
poor fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility 
and he considered the existence of each under inch a blow with grateful wonder 
robert offence was un but lucy was infinitely worse 
neither of them was ever again to be mentioned to mrs forrard 
and even if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter nor be permitted to anger in her presence 
the secrecy which every ling had~heen carried on between them was rationally treated as enormously enlightening the crime because had any suspicion of it occurred on the others proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage 
and he called on linton to join with him in regretting that lucy s engagement with edward had not ratherlbeen ful liked than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family

in short 
you may a well give her a chance 
yon unnerved me 
but though mrs fear did come to see them and always treated them with the make-believe of decent affection they were never insulted by her real favour and preference 
t but was due to the folly of robert and the cunning of his wife 
and it was earned them before many months had paused away 
the elder elegance of the latter which had at first drawn robert into e escape war the principal integument of his deliverance from it 
for her respectful humility deciduous attention end endless catherine a moon er the implicit ripening war given for their energies reconciled me errors to his choice and re-eetahliehed him completely in her favour

therefore may be held forth a a most encouraging instance of what en earnest an unfeeling attention to self-interest however it progress may he apparently obstructed will do in occurring every advantage of fortune with no other eerie than that of time end conference 
when robert fret nought her a distance and private visited her in bartlett’e burying it we only the view imparted to him by his brother

what edward had done to forfeit the right of old son i t have puzzled many people to and out

it was an arrangement however justified in its effects if not in it cause 
for nothing ever appeared in robert water of living or of talking to give a suspicion of hit regretting the extent of his income as either leaving lull brother too little or bringing himself too much
