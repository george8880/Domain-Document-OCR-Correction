he family of dashwood had been long settled in sussex 
their estate was large and their residence was at norland park in the centre of their property where for many generations they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance 
the ate owner of this estate was a single man who lived to a very advanced age and who for many years of his life had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister 
but her death which happened ten years before his own produced a great alteration in his home 
for to supply her loss he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew mr henry dashwood the legal interior of the norland estate and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it 
in the society of his nephew and niece and their children the old gentleman days were comfortably spent 
his attachment to them all increased 
the constant attention of mr and mrs hemy dashwood to his wishes which proceeded not merely from interest but from goodness of heart gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive 
and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence 
i 
a i sense and sensibility 
by a former marriage mr henry dashwood had one son 
3 his present lady three daughters 
the son a steak yet be young man was amply provided for by the one of his mother which had been large and half of which resolved on him on his coming of age 
by his own mania e likewise which hap soon afterwards he had to his wealth 
to him therefore the succession to the norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters 
for their fortune independent of what might arise to them from their fathers inheriting that property could be but small 
their mother had nothing and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal 
for the remaining society of his first wife fortune was also secured to her child and he had only a life interest in it 
the old gentleman died 
his will was read and like almost every-lather will gave as much disappointed as pleasure 
e was neither so unjust nor so ungrateful as to leave his estate from his nephew 
but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest 
mr dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son 
but 
to his son and his son s son a child of four ears old it was secured in such a way as to leave to myself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him and who most needed a provision any charge on the estate or by any leg of its was unable woods 
the whole was tied up for the benefit of this child who in occasional visits with his father and mother at norland had so far gained on the affections of his uncle by such attractions as are by no was unusual in children of two or three years old an imperfect articulation an earnest desire of having his own way many cunning tricks and a great deal of noise as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which for years he had received from his niece and her daughters 
scenes 
and sinsxbilitv 
3 he meant not to be unkind however and as a mark of his affection for the three girls he left them a thousand pounds apiece 
mr dashwood’s diaa instrument was at first severe 
but his temper was cheap us and sanguine and he might reasonably hope to live many years and by living economically lay by 1 considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large and capable of almost immediate improvement 
but the fortune which had been so lady in coming was his only one twelvemonth 
he survived his uncle no longer 
and ten thousand pounds including the late ladies was all that remained for his widow and daughter his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known and to him mr dashwood recommended with all the strength and urgency which illness could come mad the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters 
mr john dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family 
but he was affected by a res commendation of such a nature at such s time and he promised to do everything in his power to make them comfortable 
his father was rendered easy by such an assurance 
and mr john dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them 
he was not an ill-disposed young man unless to be rather coli-heaned and rather llellllllll is to be filled sends us he was in nem we respected 
for lreﬁnducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties 
had he married a more amiable woman he might have been made still more respectable than he was 
he might even have been made amiable himself 
for he was very young when he married and very fond of his wife 
but mrs john dashwood was a surer caricature of himself 
more narrow-minded and self she 
4 sense and sensibility 
when he gave his promise to his father he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds apiece 
he then ’ really thought himself equal to it 
e pmsycct of four thousand appear in addition to his present income besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune warmed his heart and made him feel ca hire of generosity 
yes he would give them three oumnd pounds it would be liberal and handsome 
it would be enough to make them completely a 
three thousand pounds 
he could me so cansi cable a sum with little inconvenience e thought of it all day long and for many days successively and he did not repent 
no sooner was his father's funeral over than mr john dashwood without sending an notice of her intention to her mother-in-law arrive with her child and their attendants 
no one could dispose her right to come 
the house was her husband from the moment of his father's decease 
but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater and to a woman in mrs dashwood’s situation with only common feelings must have been highly unpleating 
but in her mind there was a sense of honour to keen a generosity so romantic that any offence of the kind by whomsoever given or received was to her a source of immovable disgust 
mrs john dashwood had never been a favourite in with any of her husband's family but she had had no opportunity till the present of showing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it 
so acutely did mrs dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour and so earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it that on the arrival of the latter she would have quitted the house for ever had not the entree of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going and her own tender love for sense and sinsibihty 
5 all her three children determined her afterwards to stay and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother 
elinor this eldest daughter whose advice was so effectual possessed a strength of understanding and coolness of judgment which equalled her though only nineteen to be the counsellor of her mother and enabled her frequently to counteract to the advantage of them all that eagerness of mind in mrs dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence 
she had an excellent heart 
her disposition was affectionate and her feelings were strong but she knew how to govern them it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be 
taught 
a arianues abilities were in man respects uite equal to elinor’s 
she was sensible and clever 
but eager in everything 
her sorrows her joy i could have no moderation 
she was generous amiah e interesting she was everything but prudent 
the resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great 
elinor saw with concern the excess of her sister's sensibility 
but by mrs dashwood it was valued and cherished 
they encouraged each other now in the violence of their affection 
the agony of grief which overpowered them at first was voluntarily renewed wan sought for was created again and again 
they gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future 
elinor too was deeply afflicted 
but still she could struggle she could often herself 
she could consult with her brother could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival and treat her with proper mention and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion and encourage her to similar forbearance 
6 sense and sensibility 
margaret the other sister was a good-humoured well-disposed 
d 3 but as she had already imbibed a good deal of an'anne’s romance without having much of her sense 
the did not at thirteen bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life 
both 3 
as john dashwood now installed herself mistress of norland 
and her mother and sister-in-law were dreaded to the condition of visitors 
as such however they were treated by her with quiet civility 
and by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself his wife and their child 
he really pressed them with some earnestness to consider norland as their home 
and as no plan appeared so eligible to mr dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate heroelfwith a house in the neighbourhood his invitation was accepted 
a continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight was exactly what suit her mind 
in season of cheerfulness no temper could be more cheerful than hers or 230m in a greater degree that sanguine expectation of happiness which is his itself 
but in narrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy 
mrs john dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters 
to take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be inqmvcrishing him to the most dreadful degree 
she begged him to think again on the subject 
how could he answer it to himself to rob his child and his only child too of so large a sum 
sense and sensibility 
7 and what possible claim could the mind dadrwoods who were related to him only by half blood which the considered an no relationship at all have on his generoeity to to large an amount 
it war very well known that no affection war ever in to exist between the children of any man by i rent man-iagee 
and why was he to ruin himself and their poor little harry by giving away all his money to his half-listen 
it was my father last request to me replied her husband that i should again his widow and daughters 4 he did not know what he was talking of i dare to 3 ten to one but he wan light-headed at the time 
he been in his right senses he could not love thought of such a thing in begging on to give away half our fortune from our own child 
a e did not its ate for any particular urn my dear fanny 
he only requested me in general terror to suit them and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do 
perhaps it would have been at well if he had left it wholly to myself 
he could hardly suppose i should neglect them 
but an he required the promise i could not do less than give it at least i thought so at their 
the promise therefore was given and must be something must be done for them whenever they leave norland and settle in a new home well then it 
something be done for them 
but him 
something need not be three thousand consider 6 the added a that when the money ll once parted with it never can return 
your listen will marry and it will be gone for ever 
if indeed it could ever be restored to our poor little in 
a way to be mine said her husband very gravely a that would make a neat dill'erence 
the time may come when harry wili regret that in large a turn was 8 sense and sensibility 
parted with 
if he should have a numerous family for instance it would be a very convenient additional a to be sure it could a perhaps then it would be better for all parties the sum were diminished one half 
five hundred would be a prodigious increased to their fortune 
she beyond an thing great 
what brother on earth would do hill 
i much for him listen even if really his sisters 
and as it it 
only hdfbloodl but on have such a generous spirit l 7 a would not with to do anything mean he replied a one had rather on inch occasions do too much than too little 
no one at least can think i have not done enough for them even themoelvel they can hardly expect more there is no knowing what they may expect a laid the lady but we are not to think of their expectation the question in what you can afford to do a plainly and i think i may afford to give them over hundred pounds a 
piece 
airs it in without any addition of mine they will each have above three thousand pounds on their mothers death a very comfortable fortune for any young woman a to be sure it it and indeed it strikes me that they can want no addition at all 
they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them 
if they marry they will he sure of doing well 
and if they not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest often thousand pounds 
a that is very true and therefore i do not know whether upon the whole it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while the lives rather than for them 
something of the antiquity kind i mean 
my sisters would feel the good chance of it on well as herself 
a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable sense and sensibility 
9 his wife hesitated a little however in giving her consent to this plan 
to be sure a said she it is better than parting with ﬁfteen hundred pounds at once 
but then if mrs dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in a fifteen years 
my dear fanny 
her life can not be worth half that purchase certainly not 
but if you observe ple always live for ever when there is any annuity w them 
and the in very stout and healthy and hardly forty 
an anxiety i. a very anxious business 
it comes over and over every year and there is no getting rid of it 
you are not aware of what you are doing 
1 have known a great deal of the trouble of anxieties 
for my mother wan closed with the payment of three to old supemnnuated servanu by my father s will and it is amazing how disagreeable the found it 
twice every year these inquiries were to he paid 
and then then was the trouble of getting it to them 
and then one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing 
my mother was wise sick of it 
her income was not her own she said with such real claims on it 
and it worth more unlucky in my ear because otherwiae the money would have been entirely it in others diapoeal without any description whatever 
t hat given me such an abhorrence of inquiries that i am sure i would not in myeelf down to the payment of one for all the world a it is certainly an unpleasant thing replied mr dashwood a to have those kind of yearly drains on one income 
one fortune as your mother justly says is no 
one own 
to be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum on every rent day 
is by no mean desirable it takes away one’e independence undoubtedly 
and after all you have no thanks to sense and sensibility 
for it 
they think themselves censure you do no more than what it expected and it nines no gratitude at all 
if i were you whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely 
i would not bind myself to allow them anything yearly 
it may be very inconvenient some years to apart a hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expenses i believe you are right my love 
it will be better that there should be no ingenuity in the case 
whatever i may give them occasionally will be of far greater instance than a yearly allowance because they would only enlarge their after of living if they felt sure of a larger income and would not 
be silence the richer for it at the end of the year 
it will certainly be much the best way 
a present of fifty pounds now and then will prevent their ever being diverted for money and will lp think he amply dircharging my promise to my father to be sure it will 
indeed to by the truth i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all 
the since he thought of i dare say was only such as might be reasonably expected of you 
for instance such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them helping them to move their things and lending them present of shy and game and so forth whenever they are in season 
i ll la my life that he meant nothing further 
indeed it would be very strange and unreuonable if he did 
do but conrirlcr my dear mr dashwood how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings them in fifty pounds arms apace and of come they will pay their mother for their board out of it 
altogether they will have live hundred n-ymr amongst them and what on earth can sense and sensibmjtv 
i four women want for more than that 
they will live so cheap 
their housekeeping will be nothing at all 
they will have no carriage no horses and hardly any servants 
they will keep no company and can have no expenses of any kind 
only conceive how comfortable they will be 
five hundred 3-year 
i am sure i can not imagine how they will spend half of it 
and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it 
they will be much more able to give you something upon m word said mr dashwood 
i believe you are pe ctly right 
my either certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you an 
i clearly understand it now and i will strictly fullil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described 
when in mother removed into another house my services she be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can 
some little present of furniture 
too may be acceptable then. 
certainly returned mrs john dashwood 
a but however one thing must be considered 
when your father and mother moved to norland though the furniture of still was sold all the china plate and linen was saved and is now left to your mother 
her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it that is a material consideration undoubtedly 
a valuable legacy indeed 
and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here yes 
and the net of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house 
a gate deal too handsome in my opinion for any place lg can ever afford to live in 
but however so it is 
your father thought only of then 
and i must my this that 12 sense and sensibility 
you owe no particular gratitude to him nor attention to hit wither 
or we very well know that if he could he would have left ill everything in the world to 152m.” this argument was irresistible 
it gave to his inten 
tom whatever of decision we wanting before 
and he finally resolved that it would be absolutely momentary if not highly indccoroun to do more for the widow and children of his father than such kind of neighbourly acts at his own wife pointed out 
throm333 
as dashwood remained at norland ieveral months 
not from any inclination to mine when the sight of every well-known lpot opened to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while 
for when her spirits began to revive and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its afﬂiction by melancholy remembrances she was impatient to be gone and in efetigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of norland 
for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible 
but the could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease and suited the pretence of her eldest daughter who steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income which her mother would have approved 
mrs dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour which gave comfort to his lost artth reﬂectionu 
she doubted the sincerity of this maniac no more than he had doubted it himself and the thought of it for her daughters sake with nonﬁction though sense and sensibility 
13 as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller rovision than seven thousand pounds would support her in silence 
for their brothers sake too for the sake of his own heart she rejoiced 
and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before in believing him incapable of generosity 
his attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their silence was dear to him and for a long time she warmly relied on the liberality of his intentions 
the contempt which she had very early in their acquaintance felt for her daughter-in-law was very much increased by the further knowledge of her character which half-a-yenr’s residence in her family altordd 
and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility according to the opinions of mrs dashwood to her daughters continuance at norland 
this circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of mrs john dashwood a gentleman-like and pleasing young man who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sisters establishment at norland and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there 
some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest for edward fears was the eldest son of a man who had died very rich 
and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence for except a trifling sum the whole of his fortune depended on the will s his mother 
but mrs dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration 
it was enough for her that he a bred to be amiable that he loved her daughter an that elinor returned the partiality 
it was contrary to every routine of hen in sense aid shsybhjtv 
that difference of fortune should keepsn couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of a tone 
and that elinor merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her was to her company in he 
towards ferraro was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address 
he was not handsome and his manners required intimacy to make then pleasing 
he was too dillidcnt to do justice to himself 
but when his natural shyness was overcome his behaviour gave every indication of an open affectionate heart 
his understanding was good and his education had given it solid improvement 
but he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister who longed to see him distinguished 
as 
they hardly knew what 
they wanted him to make a one figure in the world in some manner or other 
his mother wished to interest him in critical concerns to get him into parliament or to act him connected with some of the great men of the day 
mrs john dashwood wished it likewise 
but in the meanwhile till one of these superior blessings could be obtained it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche 
but edward had no turn for great men or baronches 
all his wishes centred in domestic comfort and the quiet of private life 
fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising 
edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of mrs dashwood s attention 
for she was at that time in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects 
she saw only that he was quiet and obtrusive and she liked him for it 
he did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation 
she was first called to observe and approve him further by a reflection which elinor sense and sensibility 
15 chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister 
it was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother 
it is enough said she 
to say that he is unlike fanny is enough 
it implies everything amiable 
i love him already 
i think you will like him a said elinor 1 when you know more of him 
like him 
a replied her mother with a smile 
a i can feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love 
a you may esteem him a i have never yet known what it 
was to separate esteem and love 
mrs dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him 
her manners were attaching and soon banished his'reserve 
she speedily comprehended all his merits 
the persuasion of his regard for elinor perhaps assisted her penetration 
but she really felt assured of his worth and even that quietness of manner which militated against all her estaiilished ideas of what a young man’s address ought to be was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affectionate 
no sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to elinor than she considered their serious attachment as coming and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching 
2 in a few months my dear marianne a said she a elinor will in all probability be settled for life 
we shall miss her 
but 11 will be happy a of mamma 
how shall we do without her 
a 
my love it will be scarcely 1 separation 
we shall live within a few miles of each other and shall meet every day of our lives 
you will gain a brother 
no real affectionate brother 
i have the highest opinion in the world of edward’s hurt 
but you ll sense and sinsibilxtv 
look grave marianne 
do you disapprove your sisters choice 
a perhaps a said marianne a i may consider it with some surprise 
edward is very amiable and i love him tenderly 
but yet he is not the kind of young man 
there is a something wanting his figure is not striking 
it has none of that grace which i should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister 
his eyes want all that spirit that are which at once announce virtue and intelligence 
and besides all this i am afraid mamma he has no real taste 
music seems scarcely to attract him and though he admires elinor’s drawings very much it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth 
it is evident in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws that in fact he knows nothing of the matter 
he admires as a lover not as a connoisseur 
to satisfy me those characters must be united 
i could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every nt coincide with my own 
he must enter into all my feelings 
the same books the same music mun charm us both 
of mamma how spiritless how tame was edward’s manner in reading to us last 
night 
i felt for my sister most severely 
yet she bore it with so much composure she seemed scarcely to notice it 
i could hardly keep my seat 
to hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild pronounced with such impenetrable calmness such dreadful indifference 
she would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose 
i thought so at the time 
but you would give him cowper 
nay mamma if he is not to be animated by cowper s 
but we must allow for difference of taste 
elinor has not my feelings and therefore she may overlook it and be happy with him 
but it would have ﬂaw/ﬂimsy sense and sensibhjty 
1 broken m heart had i loved him to hear him read with no little mailaility 
emma the more i know of the world the more am i convinced that i shall never see a man whom i can really love 
i require is much 
he must have all edward s virtue and his potent and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charming a remember my love that you are not oeventeen 
it in yet too early in life to despair of such an happiness 
why should you be i 
fortunate than your mother 
in one circumstance only my marianne may your destiny bediil‘crcnt from here 
1 chapter 3 
a hat a pity it in elinor aid marianne 
that edward should have no note for drawing 
no taste for drawing 
replied elinor 
why should or think so 
e does not know kind indeed t he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people and i assure you he in by no means deficient in natural taste though he is not had opportunities of proving it 
had he ever been in the way of learning think he would have drawn very well 
he diam his own joy t in such matters to much that he in ways unwi sing to give his opinion on any picture 
but he ha an innate and simplicity of taste which in general direct him perfectly right marianne was afraid of attending and laid no more on the subject 
but the kind of approbation which elinor described an excited in him by the drawing e of other people was very far from that rapturous delight i. u 18 sense and sensibility 
which in her opinion could alone be called taste 
yet though smiling within herself at the mistake the honoured her sister for that blind partiality to edward which produced it 
a i hope marianne a continued elinor 5 on do not consider him is deficient in general taste 
indeed i think i may say that our can not for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial and iii/m 
were your opinion i am sure you could never be civil to him marianne hardly knew what to my 
she would not wound the feelings of her sister on any account and et to say what she did not believe as impossible 
at length she rose lied 
do not offended elinor if my praise of him it not in everything equal to your sense of his merits 
i have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minute propensities of his mind his inclination and tastes as you have 
but i have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense 
i think him everything that is worthy and amiable a i am sure replied elinor with a smile that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with inch come mendation as that 
i do not perceive how you could ex ress yourself more warmly.” glinrianne was rejoiced to and her sister so easily pleased 
of his sense and his goodness a continued elinor a no one can i think be in doubt who has seen him often enough he to engage him in unreserved conversation 
the excellence of his understanding and his principal ies can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keep him silent 
you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth 
but of his manner propensities as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself 
he and i have been at times thrown a good deal together while sense and sensible 
19 you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate rineiple by my mother 
i have seen a run deal of him have studied his sentiments and his opinion on subjects of literature and taste 
and upon the whole i venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed his enjoyment of books exceedingly great his imagination lively his observation just and correct and his taste delicate and pure 
his abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person 
at first sight his address is certainly not striking 
and his person can hardly be called handsome till the expression of his eyes which are uncommonly good and the general sweetness of his countenance is perceived 
at present i know him so well that i think him really handsome 
or at least almost so 
what my you marianne 
7 a i shall we soon think him handsome elinor if i do not now 
hen you tell me to love him as a brother i shall no more see imperfection in his face than i now do in his heart elinor started at this declaration and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into in speaking of him 
she felt that edward stood very high in her opinion 
she believed the regard to be mutual 
but she required greater certainty of it to make marianne’s conviction of their attachment agreeable to her 
she knew that what marianne and her mother conjectured one moment they believed the next 
that with them to wish was to hope and to hope was to expect 
she tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister 
a i do not attempt to deny a said she a that i think very highly of him 
that i greatly esteem that i like him marianne here burst forth with indignation 
teaze him 
like him 
cold-hearted elinor 
20 sense and sensibility 
oh 
worse than cold-hemedl ashamed of being otherwise 
are the words again and will have the room this moment 
elinor could not help laughing 
excuse in laid the and be assured that s mantnooﬁ'ume to or satin into uietawa.ofm ownfeell'ngl 
byill-lite gthem toqbe stronger than have *clnml 
believe them in short table such a his merit and the suspicion 
the hope of hit affection for me my warrant without imprudence or folly 
but further than thin on must not believe 
i am by no mean 
assured of but regard for me 
there are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful 
and till his sentiments ue‘ fully known you not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality b 1 or calling it more than it is 
in my heart need little 
scarcely y any doubt of his preference 
but there are other point 
to be convinced maiden his inclination 
he ll very far from being independent 
what his mother really ll we can not know 
but from fanny occaaional mention of her conduct and opinions we have never been disposed to think her amiable 
and i in 
very much mistaken if edward is not herself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way if he were to with to marry a woman who had not either a gun 
fortune or high rank 
marianne wan astonished to and how much the imagination of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth 
and you really are not engaged to him 
a said she 
yet it certainly soon will happen 
but two advantage will proceed from thin delay 
i shall not low you in won and edward will have greater op) purity of improving that natural mute for your lavauriu pursuit which must be of indispensably necessary to your future felicity 
oh 
if he ihould sense and sensibility 
a 
be so far nimulzted by your genius as to learn to draw himself how delightful it would be 
a elinor had given her real opinion to her sister 
she could not consider her partiality for edward in so prosperous a state as marianne had believed it 
there was at times a want of spirit 
about him which if it did not denote indifference spoke a something almost as unpromiring 
a doubt of her regard supposing him to feel it need not give him more than inquretude 
it would not be likely to produce that direction of mind which frequent 
attended him 
a more reasonable cause might be and in the de dent situation which formed the indulgence of his i ection 
she knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself without strictly attending to her views for his i mndisement 
with such a knowledge as this it was impossible for elinor to feel easy on the subject 
she was far from depending on that result of his preference of her which her mother and sister still considered as certain 
nay the longer they were together the male doubtful seemed the nature of his regard 
and sometimes for a few painful minutes she believed it to be no more than fnendvhi 
ill whatever might really be its limits it was enough when perceived by his sister to make her uneasy 
and it the same time which was still more common to make her uncivil 
she took the first opportunity of aﬂ'ronting her mother-in-law on the occasion talking to her so expressively of her brothers glut expectations of mrs ferrars’s resolution that both her sons should marry well and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to draw bid in that mrs ashwood could neither pretend to he unconscious nor endeavour to be calm 
she gave her an power which 12 sense and sinslbllity 
marked her contempt and instantly left the room 
resolving that whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a revival her beloved elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuationsin this state of her spirits a letter was delivered to her from the post which contained a proposal particularly well-timed 
it was the offer of a small house on very easy terms belonging to a relation of her own a gentleman of consequence and property in devomhire 
the letter was from this gentleman himself and written in the true spirit of friends accommodation 
he understood that she was in need of a dwelling and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary if the situation pleased her 
he earnestly pressed her after giving the particulars of the house and garden to come with her daughters to barton park the lace of his own recidmce from whence the might judge herself whether barton cottage for the houses were in the some parloh could by any alteration be made comfortable to her 
he seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style at could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin 
more especially at a moment when she was sinking under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections 
she needed no time for delibcmtinn or im‘luiry 
her a solution was formed as she read 
the situation of barton in a county so far distant from susan s devonxhire which but a few hours before would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every ble advantage belonging to the place war now its mt recommendation 
to it the neighbourhood of norland was no longer an evil 
it was an object of desire 
it was a blessing in comparison of the misery of continuing sense and sensibility her daughters 
less guest and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress 
she instant wrote sir john middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness and her acceptance of his proposal 
and then hastened to nhowhoth letters to her daughters that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from norland than immediately amongst their present acquaintance 
on box 
head therefore it was not for her to oppose her mother s intention of removing into devonshine 
the house too as described by sir john was on so simple a scale and the rent so uncommonly moderate as to leave her no right of objection on either point 
and therefore though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy though it was a removal from the vicinity of norland beyond her wishes she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending her letter of acquiescence 
thank 17 
no sooner was her answer despatchcd than mrs dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house and should incommode them no longer than till everything were read for her inhabiting it 
they heard her with s praise 
like john dashwood said nothing 
but her husband civilly that she would not be settled far from norland 
he had great satisfaction in reply in that she was going into derbyshire 
edward jumped hastily towards heron hearing this and in a voice of surprise and concern which 24 sense and sensibility 
required no explanation to her repeated a devounhilel are you indeed going there 
so far from hence 
and to what part 
of it a she explained the agitation 
it was within four mile 
northward of exeter 
a it ll but a cottage 6 the continued but i hope to see many of my friend in it 
a room or two can easily be added 
and if to friend and no difficulty in travelling so far to see me am sure i will and none in accommodating them 
she concluded with a very kind invitation to mr and mr john dashwood to visit her at barton 
and to edward the gave one with still greater affection 
though her late conversation with her days hter-in-law had made her resolve on remaining at morland no longer than wan unavoidable it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended 
to separate edward and elinor was far from being her object as ever 
and like wished to thaw mu john dashwood dill pointed invitation to her brother how totally the regarded her disapproha 
tom of the match 
mr john dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that the had taken an hour at week i distance from norland as to prevent hit being of an service to her in removing her furniture 
he really felt t conscientioust vexed on the occasion 
for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by thin arrangement rendered impracticable 
— the furniture wan all lent round by water 
it chiefly consisted of houlehold linen plate china and books with an handsome fortune of marianne’s 
mr john dashwood saw the package depart with a sigh 
the could not he 
ﬁacling it hard that an m11 daphwood'a income would be do trying in comparison with their own the should have any hand article of furniture 
sense and sensibility 
25 mrs dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth 
it was ready furnished and she might have immediate possession 
no difficulty arose on either side in the agreement 
and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at norland and to determine her future household before she set all for the west 
and this as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her was soon done 
— the horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his duty and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter 
for the come for of her children had she consulted only her own wishes she would have kept it 
but the discretion of elinor prevailed 
her wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three 
two maids and a man with whom they were speedily divided from amongst those who hsdznned their stay lishment st norland 
the man and one of the maids were sent of immediately into derbyshire to prepare the house for their mistress’l arrival 
for as lady middleton was entirely unknown to mrs dashwood she prevented going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at barton park 
and she relied so undouhtingly on sir john’s descrip 
tom of the house as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own 
her a eagerness to be gone from norland was preserved from dimrnution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the hero cut of her removal 
a satisfaction which was but lee yet attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure 
now was the time when her son-in-law promise to his father might with particular propriety be filled 
since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment but mrs dashwood began 26 sees and sensibility 
shortly give over every oftheltind mdtobe convinced from the general gift of hit discourse that his auimmce extended no further than their maintenance for six months at norland 
he is frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping 
and of the perpetual demand upon his purse which a inn of any consequence in the world war beyond calculation exposed to that he seemed rather to and in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away 
in a very few week from the day which brought sir john middleton’e first letter to norland every thing was to far settled in their future nbodeme to end e mu dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey

he had formerly visited at stanh but it was too long ago for his young cousins to remember him 
his countenance was thoroughly goodhumoured 
and his manners were a friendly as the style of his letter 
their arrival seemed to a word him real satisfaction and their comfort to be an object of real solicitude to him 
he said much of his meet desire of their living on the most sociable terms with his family 
and pressed them so cordially to dine at barton park every yet till they were better settled at home that though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility they could not give offence 
his kindness was not confined to words 
for within an hour after he left them a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game 
he insisted moreover on conveying all their letters to and from the t for them and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day

arton park was about half a mile from the cottage 
the ladies had passed near it on their way along the valley but it was screened from their view at home by the protection of m hill 
the house was large and handsome 
and the middleton lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance 
the former was for sir john’s gratiﬁcation the latter for that of his lady 
they were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood 
it was necessary to the happiness of both 
for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which continued her employments unconnected with such as society produced within a very narrow compass 
sir john was a sportsman lady middleton a mother 
he hunted and shot and she humours her children 
and these were their only resources 
lady middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round while sir john’s independent employments were in existence only half the time 
continual enga ements at home and abroad however supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education 
supported the good spirits of sir john and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife 
lady middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table and of all her domestic amngementn 
and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties 
but sir john’s satisfaction in society was much more real 
he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold and the noise they were the better was he 31 sense and sinsibili'i'v 
pleased 
he was a blessing so all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood for in summer he was for ever forming parties to out cold ham and chicken out of doors and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not mﬂ'ering under the invariable appetite of fifteen 
the arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitant 
he had now procured for his cottage at barton 
the miss daubwoods were young 
pretty and unaffected 
it was enough to secure his good of union for to be unaﬂ'eued was all that a pretty girl could d want to make her mind as captivating as her person 
the friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those whose situation might be considered in comparison with the past an unfortunate 
in showing kindness to his cousins therefore 
he had the real satisfaction of a good heart 
and in settling a family of females only in his cottage he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman 
for a sportsman though he esteem on 
those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise is not of so desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor 
mrs dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by sir john who welcomed them to barton park with unaffected sincerity 
and as he attended them to the drawing-room repented to the young ladies the concern which the am subject had drawn from him the day before at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them 
they would lee he said only one gentleman there besides himself 
a particular friend who was staying at the park but who was neither very young nor very gay 
he hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party and could assure them it should never happen so again 
he had sense and sensibility 
33 been to several families that morning in of procuring some addition to their number 
t it was moon night and every body wan full of engagements 
luckily lady i dleton’s mother had arrived at barton within the last hour and as she we a very cheerful agreeable woman he hoped the young ladies would not and it so very dull as they might imagine 
the young ladies as well as their mother were perfect y satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party and wished for no more 
mrs jennings lady middleton’s mother was a good-humoured merry fat elderly woman who talked a great deal seemed very happy and rather vulgar 
she was full of jokes and laughter and before dinner was over had said many witty things the subject of lovers and husbands 
hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in sashes and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not 
marianne was vexed at it for her sisters sake and turned her eyes towards elinor to see how she bore these attacks with an earnestness which gave elinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place misery at mrs jennings’s 
colonel brandon the friend of sir john seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend than lady middleton was to be his wife or my jennings to be lady middleton’s mother 
he was silent and grave 
his 2 assurance however was not unpleasing in spite of ill being in the opinion of marianne and margaret an absolute old bachelor for he was on the wrong side of ﬁve-and-thirty 
but thou by his face was not handsome his countenance was soon e and his address was particularly gentlemanlike 
there was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them a companions to the dashwood 
but the cold insipidity of lady middleton was so par1 
c 24 sense and sensibili'i'y 
particularly repuiaive that in comparison of it the gravity of colonel brandon and even the boiaoemua north of sir john and hit mother-in-law was interesting 
lady middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the enhance of her four noiay children after dinner who pulled her about bore her clothes and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves 
in the evening as marianne was discovered to be musical she was invited to play 
the instrument was unlocked everybody prepared to be charmed and marianne who can very well at their re neat went through the chief of the son i which lady iddleton had brought into the family on her marriage and which perhaps had lain ever trace in the name poaio'on on the pianoforte 
for her lad ship had celebrated that event by giving up music though by her mother s account the had pla ed extremely well and by her own was very fond of it 
marianne’s performance was highly applauded 
sir john was loud in his admiration at the end of every son and as loud in his conversation with the other while every long latted 
lady middleton frequently called him to order wondered how any one attention could be diverted from music for a moment and asked marianne to lift a particular song which marianne had just ﬁnilhcd 
colonel brandon alone of all the party heard her without being in raptures 
he paid her on ye the compliment of attention 
and the felt a regret for him on the occasion which the other had reasonably forfeited by their shameleu want of taste 
his pleasure in music though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathise with her own wan estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others 
and the was reasonable enough to allow that a man of ﬁve-and-thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite guns and senstnrm'v 
25 power of enjoyment 
she perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel advanced state of life which humanity required 
than 1713 
mrs jennings wan a widow with an ample jointure 
she had only two daughters both of whom the had lived to act respectath married and the had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world 
in the promotion of this object she wan zealously active as far an her affability reached and missed no opportunity of projecting wedding among all the young peo e of her acquaintance 
she was remarkably quick in discovery of attachment and had enjoyed the advantage on raining the blush and the vanity of many a young lady by inclinations of her power over such a young man 
and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at barton decisively to pronounce that colonel brandon was very much in love with mnrinune dashwood 
she rather suspected it to be no on the very first evening of their being together from his listening to attentively while she pang to them 
and when the visit wan returned by the middleton dining at the cottage the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again 
it must 
be so 
she was perfectly convinced of it 
it would be an excellent match for b was rich and -5 wan handsome 
mrs jennings had been anxious to see colonel brandon well married ever since her connection with sir john first brought him to her know 
e 
and she was always anxious to get a good husband s every pretty girl 
the immediate advantage to herself wan by no means 36 sense and smsrnru'rv 
inoonsidmble for it supplied her with endless jokes against them both 
at the park she laughed at the colonel and in the cottage e at marianne 
to the former her raillery was put by as far as it only himself exactly indifferent 
but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible 
and when its object was understood the hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity or censure its impertinence for the considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel advanced years and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor 
mrs dashwood who could not think a man ever years younger than herself so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter ventured to clear mrs jennings from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age 
a but at least mamma you can not deny the absurdity of the accusation though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured 
colonel brandon is certainly younger than mrs jennings but he is old enough to my father 
and if he were ever animated enough to be in love must have long outlived every sensation of the kind 
it is too ridiculous 
when is a man to be safe from much wit if age and inﬁrmity will not protected him 3” “inﬁrmit s said elinor 
do you call colonel brandon in run 
i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother 
but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbo 
a did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism 
and in not that the commonest infinity of declining life 2

37 mamma you are not doing me justice 
i know very well that colonel brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet 
a apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature 
e may live twenty years longer 
but thirty-live has nothing to do with matrimony.” 
perhaps said elinor 
thirty-live and seventeen had better not have anything to do with matrimony together 
but if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is in less at seven-and-twenty i should not think colonel randon’s being thirty-live any objection to his marrying her 
a woman of seven-and-twenty a said marianne after pausing a moment can never hope to feel or inepire affection again 
and if her home be uncomfom able or her fortune small i can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse for the sake of the provision and purity of a wife 
in his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable 
it would be a compact of convenience and the world would be satisfied 
in my eyes it would be no marriage at all but that would be nothing 
to me it would seem only a commercial exchange in which each wished to be acted at the expense of the others it would be impossible i know a replied elinor to convince you that a woman of seven-and 
sweet could feel for a man of thirty-live anything near enough to love to make him a desirable come on to her 
but i much object to your doing so onel brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber merely because he chanced to complain yesterday a very cold damp day of a alight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders 
a but he talked of manner waistcoats a said marianne 
a and with me a manner waistcoat is invariably connected s 38 sense and sensibility 
with aches cramps rheumatisms and even of almost that can assist the old and the f e. i a had he been only in a violent fever in would not have despised him half so much 
con marianne is not there something interesting to on in the ﬂushed cheek hollow eye and quick pulse of a fever 
a soon after this upon elinor s leaving the room emma a said marianne i have an alarm on the subject of illness which i can not conceal from you 
1 am sure edward ferraro is not well 
we have now been here almost a fortnight 
and yet he does not come 
nothing but real and son could occasion this extraordinary delay 
hat else can detain him at norland a had you any idea of his coming so soon 
said mr dashwood 
i had none 
on the contrary if i have felt any anxiety at all on the subject 
it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation when i talked of his coming to barton 
does elinor expect him already .’ 
i have never mentioned it to her 
but of wanted she must 
a i rather think you are mistaken for when i was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bed-chamber she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it as it was not likely that the room would he wanted for some time a how strange this is 
what can be the meaning of it 
but the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable 
how cold how composed were their last adieus 
how languid their conversation the last evening of their being together 
in edward’s farewell there was no distinction between elinor and me it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both

he dashwood were now settled at barton with tolerable comfort to themselves 
the house and the garden with all the objects surrounding them were now become familiar 
and the ordinary pure suits which had given to norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than norland had been able to afford since the loss of their father 
sir john middleton who called on them every day for the first fortnight and who was not in the habit of seeing much occu nation at home could not conceal his amazement on making them always employed 
their visitors except those from barton arm were not many 
for in spite of sir john s a t entreaties that they would mix more in the being wood and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service the independence of mrs dashwood’s spirit overcame the wish of society for her children 
and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk 
there were but few who could be so classed 
and it was not all of them that were attainable 
about a mile and a half from the cottage along the narrow winding valley of allenham which issued from that of barton as formerly described the guided in one of their earliest walks discovered an accident no sense and swsmru'n 
respectable-looking mansion 
which by reminding them a little of norland interested their inclination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it 
but they learnt on in sir that in possessor an elderly lady of very g character was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world and never mind from home 
the whole country about them abound in beautiful walks 
the high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to sees the exquisite enjoyment of air on their commits were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valley heneath shut up their superior beauties 
and towards one of these hills did marianne and margaret one memorable morning direct their steps attracted by the partial sunshine of a shower sky and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned 
the weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book in spite of marianne s declaration that the day would be lasting fair and that every threatening cloud would be drawn of 
from their hills 
and the two girls set all together 
they gain ascended the town rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky and when they caught in their faces the animating glass of a high south-westerly wind they pitied the fear which had prevented their mother and elinor from sharing such delightful sensations 
a is there a felicity in the world said marianne superior to this 
argaret we will walk here at least two hours margaret agreed 
and they pursued their way against the wind rising it with laughing delight or about twenty minutes longer when suddenly the clouds united over their heads and a driving rain set full in their faces 
sense and sensxhilitv 
41 chagrined and so missed they were obliged though unwillingly to turn ask for no shelter was nearer than their own house 
one consolation however remained for them to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety 
it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate 
they set off 
marianne had at first the advantage but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground and margaret unable to stop herself to assist her was invofluntarily hurried along and reached the bottom in so 
gentleman carrying a gun with two points playing round him was passing up the hill and within a few yards of marianne when her accident happened 
he put down his on and ran to her assistance 
she had raised herself rorn the ground but her foot had been twisted in the fall and she was scarcely able to stand 
the gentleman offered his services and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered neces 
mary took her up in his arms without farther delay and carried her down the hill 
then passing through the garden the gate of which had been left open by margaret he bore her directly into the house whither margaret as just arrived and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour 
elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance and while the eyes of they were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprang from his appearance he apologised for his intrusion by relating its cause in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person which was uncommonly handsome received additional charms from his voice and expression 
had he been even old ugly and vulgar the gratitude and kindness of mrs dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child

his

the honour wan readily granted 
and he then departed to make himself still more interesting 
in the midst of an heavy rain 
hit manly beauty and 
more than common gracefulneu were instantly the theme of general admiration and the laugh which his gallantry raised against marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attraction marianne herself had seen sense of hit pemn than the rest for the confusion which crimeoned over her face on his lifting her up had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house 
but the had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others and with an energy which always adorned her praise 
hit person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite itory 
and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality there was a rapidity of thou but which particularly recommended the action to her

sir john called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of sense and sensibility 
43 doors 
and marianne’s accident being related to him he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of willoughby at allenham 
“willoughbyl 
cried sir john 
wit is be in the country 
that is good news however 
i un'll ride over w-mormw and ask him to dinner on thursday a you know him then

all you can so for him 
a cried marianne indignantly 
but w at are his manner on more intimate acquaintance 
what his pursuits his talents and genius 
sir john was rather puzzled 
upon my soul said he 
i do not know much about him as to all bath but he is a pleasant goodhumoured fellow and has got the nicest little black pitch of a point i ever saw 
was she out with him to-day 
but marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of mr willoughby’s winter than he could describe to her the shades of is mind 
but who is he 
a said elinor 
a where does he come from 
has he a house at allenham 
5 on this point sir john could give more certain intelligence 
and he told them that mr willoughby had no property of his own in the country 
that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at allenham court to whom he was faded and whose sions he was to inherit 
adding a yes yes he is very well worth catching i can tell you miss dashwood 
ye sense and sensibility 
he has a pretty little distance of his 
own in somenenhire besides 
and if i were you i would not give him up to m youn s illness in spite of all thin tumbling down his i 
marianne mull not expect to have all the men to herself 
brandon will be jealous if the does not take care 
a i do not believe a said mr dashwood with a goodhumoured smile a that mr willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of my daughter toward what you call calling him 
it is not an employment to which they have been brought up 
men are very safe with us let them be ever in rich 
i am glad to and however 
from what you say that he in a respectable young man and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible 
4 he is at good a can 
of fellow i believe as ever lived repented sir john 
i remember it chrinnm at a little he at the park he danced from eight o'clock till four without once lining down a did he indeed 
cried marianne with sparkling eyes a and with elegance with spirit 
yes 
and he was up again at eight to ride to covering a that is what i like 
that ll what a young nun ought to be 
whatever be his pursue his eagerness in then should know no moderation and leave him no sense of fatigue 
ay ay i see how it will be a aid sir john 
i lee how it will be 
you will be netting your cap at him now and never think of poor brandon that is an expression sir john a said marianne warmly 1 which i particularly dislike 
i abhor every common-place phrase by which wit it intended 
and setting one’a cap at a man 1 or making a conquest are the man odious of all 
their tendency is ground and illiberal 
and if their common could ever be sense and sensibility 
-5 deemed clever time hat long ago destroyed all it inherit as sir on did not much under-hung thin roof 
but he laughed a heartily as if he did an then replied 
ay you will make converts enough i dare by one way or other 
poor brandon 
he in quite smitten already and he is very well worth netting your cap at i can tell you in it of all this tumbling about and springing of handles chapter i marianne’s never at margaret 
with more ele nice than precilion itiled willoughby call at the cottage early the next morning to make his real inquiries 
he vial received by a dairy/bod e with more than litenete 
with a'kindneu which sir john’l account of him and her own gratitude prompted 
and everything that passed during the visit ended to assure him of the acts elegance mutual affection and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him 
of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced 
miss dashwood had a delicate complexion regular features and a remarkably pretty sure 
marianne was still handwmer 
her form though not it correct ll her sisters in having the advantage of height was more striking 
and her face war so lovely that when in the common cant of pride the wan called a beautiful girl truth was less violently courage than really happen

encouraged by this to a further examination of his

-5 pretty well 
you have already ascertained mr willoughby s opinion in almost 
every matter of importance 
you know what he thinks of no s and scott 
you are certain of his estimating their duties as he ought and you have received every assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper 
but how it your acquaintance to be long supported under such extraordinary despatch of every no object for discourse 
you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic 
another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturuque beauty and second burning and then you can have nothing farther to ask 
7 a elinor a cried marianne a is this fair 
is this just 
are my ideas so scanty 
but i see what you mean 
i have been too much at my ease too ha by too frank 
i have erred against every common-p ace notion of decorum 
i have been open and sincere where i on but to have been reserved spiritlcss dull and deceit 
had i talked only of the weather and the roads and had i spoken only once in ten minutes this reproach would have been spared my love a said her mother you must not be offended with elinor 
she was only in i should scold her myself if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friends marianne was softened in a moment 
willoughlry on his side gave every roof of his leisure in their acquaintance which an evil end with of improving it could offer 
he came to them every day 
to inquire after marianne was at rest his excuse 
but the encouragement of his reception to which every day gave greater kindness made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible by marianne perfect recovery 
she was confined for some days to the house but never had any conﬁnement been less irksome 
willoughby was a young man 48 says and sensram-rv 
of good abilities quick imagination lively spirits and open affectionate manners 
he was exactly formed to engage marianne’s heart 
for with all this he joined not only a captivating person but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the exact leg of her own and which recommended him to her soon beyond everything else 
his society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment they read they talked they sang together 
his musical talents were considerable 
and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which edward had unfortunately wanted 
in mrs dashwood’s estimation he was as faultless as in marianne’s 
and elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister of saying too much what he thought on every occasion without attention to persons or circumstances 
in hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly pro pity he displayed a want of caution which elinor con d not approve in spite of all that he and marianne could say in its sup rt 
marianne began now to perceive that ll desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection had been rash and unjustiﬁable 
willoughby was all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every brighter period as capable of attaching her 
and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that res act as men as his abilities were strong 
her brother too in whose mind not one speculative thought of their marriage had been raised by his prospect of riches was led before the end of a week to hope and expect it and secretly to congratulate herself sense and sensibility 
5 on having gained two such sons-in-lnw as edward and willoughby 
colonel brandon’s partiality for marianne which had so early been discovered by his friends now first became perceptible to elinor when it ceased to be noticed by them 
their attention and wit were drawn on to his more fortunate rival 
and the raillery which the other had incurred before any partiality arose was removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility 
elinor was obliged though unwillingly to believe that the sea 
men which mrs jennings had assured him for her own satisfaction were now actually excited by her sister 
and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of mr willoughby an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the rest rid of colonel brandon 
she saw it with concern 
or what could a silent man of ﬁve-und-thirty hope when opposed by a very lively one of five-and-twenty 
and as she could not even wish him successful she hurtin wished him indiﬂ'erent 
she liked him 
in spite of his gravity and reserve she beheld in him an object of interest 
his manners though serious were mild 
and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloonriness of sam 
sir john had dropped hints of past inquiries and appointments which justify her belief of his being an unfortunate man and she regarded him with respect and compassion 
perhaps she tired and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by willoughby and marianne who prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young seemed resolved to undervalue his merits 
a brandon is just the kind of man a said willoughby one day when they were talking of him together when everybody speaks well of and nobody cares i 
d to sense and sensibili'i’y 
about 
whom all are delighted to see and nobody remember to talk to that it exactly what i think him cried marianne 
do not boat of it however a laid elinor for it is injustice in both of you 
he in highly rated all the family at the park and i never see him in without taking paint to converse with him 
a that he in patronised by james lied willoughby “la certainly in all favour 
but for the esteem of the others it in a reproach in itself 
who would admit to the indignity of being approved by such women as lady middleton and mrs jennings that could command the indiﬂ‘etence of anybody else 2 3 but perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and marianne will make amends or the regard of lady middleton and her mother 
if their a censure your censure may be praise 
for they are not more undiaccrning than you ate prejudiced and unjust 
in defence of your protege you can even be saucy 
a my profess a you call him in a sensible man 
and same will always have attractiom for me 
yes marianne even in a man between this and forty 
he has been 3 great deal of the world 
he been abroad 
has read and has a thinking mind 
i have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects and he has always answered my inquiries with the readiness of good-breeding and good-natured that is to say a cried marianne contemptmaly he has told you that in the am indeed the climate in hot and the mosquitoes are troubleaome 
4 he would have told me so i doubt not had i made an inch in spirit 
but they penedtobe sofa on which i had been previously inforrliied.” po sense and sensibility 
5 i a perhaps a said willoughby 9 his observation may have extended to the existence of abode gold john and anquins.” 1 may venture to say that bit obeerrau'one have stretched much farther than your caudour 
but why should you dislike him 
a i do not dislike him 
i consider him on the contrary as a very respectable man who ha everybody“ 
good word and nobody notice 
who has more in than he can spend more time than he know how to employ and two new cost every year 
d to which a cried anne 
that he has neither genius taste nor spirit 
that his understanding ha no brilliancy his feeling 
no ardour and hit voice no expreodon.’ a you decide on his in affection in much in the man a replied elinor as no much on the men of your own imagination that the commendation i am able to give of him in comparatively cold and inquiry d 
i can on pronounce him to be a sensible man we -hred well-ingmned of gentle address and i believe pone»ing an amiable heart a miss dashwood a cried willoughby 9 you are now using me unkindly 
you are endeavouring to inform me reason and to convince me against my will 
but it will not do

if it will be any cadefaction to you however to be told that i believe his character to be in other respect irreproachable i am ready to confess it

chapter 3 
little had an dashwood or her daughter imagined when they came lines into devonahire that so many engagement would arise to act a their time as softly presented themselves or that they should have such frequent invitations and such common visitors an to leave them little leisure for serious employment 
yet such was the case 
when marianne wu recovered the schemes of amusement at home and abroad which sir john had been previously forming were put in execution 
the private is at the park then began 
and articles on the water were made and accomplished as of ten at a shower october would allow 
in every meeting of the kind willoughby want included 
and the case and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give incrmu'ng intimacy to his acquaintance with the dashwood to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellence 
of marianne of marking his animated admiration of her and of receiving in her behaviour to himself the most pointed assurance of her affection 
elinor could not be surprised at their attachment 
she only wished that it were less openly shown and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of come self-command to marianne 
but anne abhorred all concealment where no real di-gmce could attend unreserve 
and to aim at the restraint of sentiment which were not in themselves illaudible appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions 
willoughby thought the same 
and their behaviour at all times was an illustration of their opinions 
when he was present the had no eye for any one sense and sensibili‘i’v 
13 else 
everything he did was right 
everything he did was clever 
if their evenings at the park were concluded with cards he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand 
if dancing formed the amusement of the night they were partners for half the time 
and when obliged to separate fora couple of dances were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke in word to anybody else 
such conduct made them of course most exceedingly law had at 
but ridicule could not shame and seemed has yet to provoke them 
mrs dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them 
to her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind 
this was the season of happiness to marianne 
her heart was devoted to willoughby and the fond attachment to norland which she brought with her from susan was more likely to he softened than she had thought it possible bofore by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home 
a elinor’s happiness was not so great 
her heart was not so much at ease nor her satisfaction in their amusementssopure 
thus forced her no com union that could make amends or what she had left mind nor that could teach her to think of norland with less regret than ever 
neither lady middleton nor my jennings could sup lay to her the conversation she missed 
although e latter was an everlasdng talker and from the rest had regarded her with a kindness which assured her a large share of her discourse 
she had already led her own history to elinor three or four times 
and had elinor’s memory been equal to her means of improvement she might have known very early in her acquaintance all the particulars of mr jennings’s last 24 sense and sinslbllﬂ'v 
tilney and what he laid to hit wife a few minutes before he died 
lady middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent 
elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve wan a mere calmness of manner with which some had nothing to do 
towards her husband and mother the wan the same as to them 
and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired 
she had nothing to lay one day that she had not said the day before 
her inipid 
it was invariable for even her spirit were always the same 
and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband provided everything were conducted in after and her two eldest children attended her she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home 
— 
and so little did her presence add to the penury of the others by any chin in their emotion that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys 
in colonel brandon alone of all her new acquaintance did elinor and a prison who could in any degree claim the respect of militia excite the interest of friendship or give pleasure an a companion 
willough was out of the question 
her admiration and beg even her sisterly regard wan all his own but he won a lover 
his attention were wholly marianne and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing 
colonel brandon unfortunately for himself had no such encouragement to think only of marianne and in conversing with elinor he found the greatest consolation for the total indifference of her lines 
selina companion for him increased as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known by him 
this suspicion was given by some word which accidentally dropt from him sense ak 
sensibilitv 
one evening at the park when they were sitting down together b mutual consent whi e the others were dancing eyes were fixed on marianne and after a silence of some minutes he said with a faint smile a your sister i understand does not approve of second attachment a no replied elinor 
a her opinions are all romantic.” 1 or rather as i believe she considers them impossible to exist 5 i believe she does 
but how she contrives it without reflection on the character of her own father who had him two wives i know not 
a few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation 
and then they may be more easy to dine and to than they now are by an yes but herself a his will probably be the case he replied 
and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions 
a i can not agree with you there a said elinor 
there are inconveniences attending such feelings as marianne’s which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for 
her sisters have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought 
and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forward to as her greatest possible advantage after a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying 
a does your sister make no distinction in her objections a just a second attachment 
or is it equally origin in everybody 
are those who have been disappointed in their first choice whether from the inconstancy of its object or the perverseness of circumstances to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives 2 3 56 sirs 
and sensiiiilitv 
upon my word 
i am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles 
i only know tint i never yetheordher admit any images of mood attachment i being pordonable 
within a said he a can not 
hold 
but i change 
a total change of moments 
no 
no do not done it 
for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way how frequently are they intended by much opinion as are but too common and too dangerourl i speak from experience 
i once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly noctuch s sister who thought and judged like her but who am an enforced change 
from a series of unfortunate circumstances 
— here he stopped suddenly 
appealed to think that he had said too much and by his countenance gave rise to conjecture 
which might not otherwise have entered elinor haul 
the lad would probably have hated without suspicion has he not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escaped his lips 
as it was it required but a alight effort of fancy to connect hit emotion with the tender recollection of past regard 
elinor a no more 
but marianne in her place would not have done so little 
the whole story would have been steadily formed under her active imagination and everything emblilhed in the most melancholy order of dimatrour love 
chapter 3 
s elinor and marianne were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of new to her history which in spite of all that she knew before of marianne imprudence and want of thought surprised her by it extravagant acrimony of sense and sensibility 
both 
marianne told her with the greatest delight that willoughby had given her a horse one that he and bred himself on his estate in somersetshire and which was exactly calculated to any a woman 
without considering that it was not in her mother s plan to keep any one 
that if the were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift she must buy another for the servant and keep a servant to ride it and after all build a stable to receive them 
the had accepted the present without agitation and told her sister of it in raptures 
he intends to send his groom into somersetshire immediately for it she added and when it arrives we will ride every day 
you shall share its use with me 
imagine to yourself my dear elinor the delight of a also on some of these downs 
most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to come rehend all the unhappy truths which attended the a it and for some time she resigned to submit to them 
as to an additional servant the expense would be a trifle 
emma the was sure would never object to it 
and any horse would do for in 
he might always get one at the park 
as to a smile the merest shed would be sufficient 
elinor then ventured to doubt the proof rivet of her receiving such a present from a man so lit e or at least so lately known to her 
this was too much 
you are mistaken elinor a aid the warm 
in supposing i know very little of 
willoughby 
have not known him long indeed but i am much better acquainted with him than i am with any other creature in the world except yourself and mamma 
it is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy 
— it is disposition alone 
seven years would be inwﬂicient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven days are more than enough for others 
i should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a 18 sense and sensibility 
home from my brother than from willoughby 
of john i know very little though we have lived together for years 
but of willoughby my judgment has long been formed elinor thought it 
wisest to touch that point no more 
she knew her sisters temper 
opposition on so tender 2 subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion 
but by an appeal to her affection for her mother by representing the inconvenience which that indulgent mother must draw on herself if as would probably be the case she contented to this increase of establishment marianne was shortly mbdued 
and she promised not to turn t her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the other and to tell willoughby when the saw him next that it must he declined 
she was faithful to her word 
and when willoughby called at the cottage the tame day elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present 
the reasons for this alteration were at the same time related and they were such as to make further uneasy on his side impossible 
his concern however was very apparent 
and after six resting it with eagerness he added in the same low voice 
a but marianne the horse ll still yours though you can not use it now 
i shall keep it on till you can claim it 
when you leave barton to her your own establishment in a more lasting 
home queen mal shall receive on 
ay this was all overheard by miss dashwood 
and in the whole of the sentence in his manner of pronouncing it and in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone she instantly saw an intimacy so decided a meaning so direct at marked a perfect agreement between them 
from that moment she doubted not sense and smxruurv 
29th of their being engaged to each other 
and the belief of it created no other rise than that the or any of their friends should be left by tempera no frank to discover it by accident 
margaret related something to her the next day which placed this matter in a still clearer light 
willonghby had spent the preceding evening with them and margaret by being left come time in the parlour with only him and anne had had opportunity for observations which with a most important face the communicated to her eldest liner when they were next by themselves 
oh elinor a she cried 
i have such a secret to tell you about marianne 
i am cure the will be married to mr willoughby very soon 
you have laid to a replied elinor almost every day since they first met on high-church down and the had not known each other a week i believe here you were certain that maritime wore his care round her neck 
but it turned out to be any the miniature of our glut-uncle 
a but indeed thin in quite another thing 
i am nun they will he married very soon for he has got a lock of her hair take care margaret 
it may be only the hair of some great-uncle of bit 
a but indeed elinor it in marianne s 
i am almost sure it is for i saw him out it on 
last night after tea when you and mamma went out of the room were whispering and talking together up an as could be and he seemed to be begging something of her and presently he took up her scissors and cut of a long lock of her hair for it was all tumbled down her back 
and he kissed it and folded it up in a piece of white paper and put it into his pocket-book from such particular stated on such authority no sense and sensibility 
elinor could not withhold her credit nor was she disposed to it for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself 
margaret’s sagacity was not always stayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister 
when is jennings attacked her one evening at the park to give the name of the young man who was elinor s particular favourite which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her margaret answered by looking at her sister and saying i must not tell may i elinor 
this of course made everybody laugh 
and elinor tried to laugh too 
but the effort was painful 
she was convinced that margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with mrs jennings 
marianne felt for her most sincerely 
but she did more harm than good to the cause by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to margaret 
a remember that whatever your conjectures may be you have no right to repeat them i never had any conjectures about it replied margaret 
it was you who told me of it yourself 
this increased the mirth of the company and margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more 
oh 
pray miss margaret let us know all about it said mrs jennings 
what is the gentleman's name i must not tell ma’am 
but i know very well what it is 
and i know where he is too 
a yes yes we can guess where he is 
at his own house at norland to be sure 
he is the curate of the parish i dare say no 11m 
he is not 
he is of no profession at all 
margaret a said marianne with great warmth sense and sensibili'i'y 
6 
you know that all this is an invention of your own and that there is no such person in existence 
well then he is lately dead marianne for i am sure there was such a man once and his name begins with an f.” most grateful did elinor feel to lady middleton for observing at this moment a that it rained very hard a though she believed the interruption to proceed less from an attention to her than from her lad ship’s great i like of all such elegant subjects of rain cry as delighted her husband and mother 
the idea however started by her was immediately pursued by colonel brandon who was on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others 
and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them 
willoughby opened the pianoforte and asked marianne to sit down to it 
and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic it fell to the ground 
but not so easily did elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her 
a party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very line place about twelve miles from barton belonging to a brother-in-law of colonel brandon without whose interest it 
could not be seen as the proprietor who was then abroad had left strict orders on that head 
the grounds were declared to be highly beautiful and sir john who was peculiarly warm in their praise might be allowed to a tolerable judge for he had formed parties to visit them at least twice every summer for the last ten years 
they contained a noble piece of water 
a sail on which wan to form a great part of the morning's amusement 
cold divisions were to be taken open carriage only to ease employed and everything conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure 
by sense and sensibility 
to some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undemking 
considering the time of year and that it had rained every day for the lane fortnight 
— and mr dashwood who had already a cold was persuaded by elinor to stay at home 
then 333 
heir intended excursions to whiten turned out very differently from what elinor had expected 
she was prepared to be wet through fatigued and far htened 
but the event was still more unfortunate or they did not go at all 
by ten o'clock the whole party were assembled at the park where they were to breakfast 
the morning was rather favourable e though it had missed all night i 
the clouds were then dispersing across the pity and the inn frequently appeared 
they were all in high spirits good humour eager to be happy and determined to submit to the greater 
inconvenience and hardship rather than be otherwise 
while they were at breakfast the letter were brought in 
among the rent there wan one for colonel brandon 
— he took it looked at the direction changed colour and immediately left the room 
a what in the matter with brandon a laid sir john 
nobody could tell his hope he has had no bad news laid lady middleton 
a it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel brandon leave my breakfau-table to suddenly.” in about ﬁve minute he returned 
a no bad news colonel i hope 3 
said mrs jennings as noon at he entered the room 
sense and sensmu'rv 
63 1 none at all ma'am i thank you 
was it from avignon 
i hope it in not any that your sister in worse 
a no ma'am 
it came from town and in merely a letter of business 
v but how came the hand to discompose you in much if it was only a letter of business 
come come this wo n't do colonel 
so let us hear the truth of it a la 7 a my dear madam a said lady middleton a recollect what you are no in a weight it up to tell you that your cousin fanny in married 2 3 said mrs jennings without attending to her daughters re roof 
a no indeed it in not 7 a well then i know who it in from colonel 
and i hope she in well 
a whom do you mean ma’am 2” aid he colouring a little 
oh 
you know who i mean 
i am particularly sorry ma'am said he addressing lad middleton a that i should receive thin letter today s it in on business which requires my immediate attendance in town 
in town i 
cried mrs jennings 
what can you have to do in town at thin time of year 
a my own lose in great 4 he continued 2 in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party 
but i am the more concerned as i fear my presence in necessary to gain our admittance at whitwell 
hat a blow upon them all was thin 
but if you write a note to the housekeeper mr brandon laid marianne eagerly 1 will it not be sufficient 
4 he shook his head 
we must go laid sir john 
it shall not be by sense and sensinlitv 
nut oil when we are so near it 
you can not go to town till to 
morrow brandon that in all his wish it could be no :35in iettled 
but it in not in my power to delay my journey at one day 
a wife you would but let know what your business is said mr jennings 1 we might see whether it could be put of or not a you would not be six hours later laid willoughby 9 if you were to defer your journey till our return i can not afford to lose an hour 
elinor then heard willoughby say in a low voice to marianne a there are some place who moot 
bear a party of pleasure 
blunder is one of them 
he wan afraid of catching cold i dare say and invited thin trick for getting out of it 
i would lay ﬁfty guinea 
the letter was of his own waiting a i have no doubt of it a replied marianne 
there it no persuading you to change your mind brandon i know of old a said sir john 
a when once you are determined on anything 
but however i hope on will think better of it 
consider here are the two lain carey come over from news the three mia dnahwoods walked up from the cottage and mr willoughby got into hours before his usual time on put a to a to hitwell.” olonel london again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of diaap injuring the party but at the nine time declared it to let unavoidable 
a well then when will you come back again i hope we shall see you at barton added her lad ship 1 at noon at you can conveniently leave town 
an we must put or the party to whiten till you return a you are very obliging 
but it in no uncertain when i may have it in my power to return that i dare not engage for it at all sense and sensibility 
-5 a of he result and shall come back a cried sir john 
a if he in not here by the end of the week i shall go after him 
ay it do sir john cried mrs jennings 
and then that you may and out what his sudden in 
a do not want to pay into other men’concern i up me it it something he in ashamed of colonel brandon’s homes were announced a you do not go to town on horseback do you i 
added sir john 
no 
only to him 
i shall then go poet 
a well as you are resolved to go i wish you a good journey 
but you had bermchange your mind 
his nature you it in not in my power 
he then took leave of the whole party 
2 in there no chance of my seeing you and your linen in town thin winter mia 
dashwood i i am afraid none at all 
then i must bid you farewell for a longer time than i could with to do to marianne he merely bowed and said nothing 
come colonel said mr 
jennings before you go do let us know what you are going about 
he wished her a good morning and attended by sir john led the room 
the complaints and lamentations which politeneu had hitherto restrained now burst forth universally 
and theyeall agreed again and again how provoking it war to so disappointed 
i can guess what his business in however a laid on jennings exultingly 
can you ma'am 
said almost everybody 
a yet 
it is about in william i am m 
a and who in miss williams 
asked marianne 
what 
do you not know who miss william in 
i am sure you must have heard of her before 
she is i. e by sense and smsrnru'rv. a relation of the colonel my dear 
a near relation 
we will not say how near for s of shocking the young ladies then lowering her voice a little she said to elinor she in his natural daughter 
a indeed 
oh 
yes 
and as like him as she can stare 
i dare any the colonel will leave her all his fortune when sir john returned he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event 
concluding however by observing that as they were all got together they must do something by way of being happy 
and after some consultation it was agreed that although happiness could only he enjoyed at whitwell 
they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country 
the carriages were then ordered 
willoughby’n wae lists and marianne never looked ha pier than when the out into it 
he drove through tile part very fast an they were soon out of sight 5 and nothing more of them we seen till their return which did not happen till after the return of all the rent 
they both seemed delighted with their drive but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes while the others went on the bows 
it was settled that there should be a dance in the evening and that everybody should be extremely merry all day long 
some more of the cards came to dinner and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table which sir john observed with great contentment 
willoughby took his natural place between the two elder miss dashwood 
mr jennings sat on elinor right hand 
and they had not been long seated before the leant behind her and willoughby and said to marianne loud enough for them both to hear his have found you out in spite of all your tricks 
i know where you spent the morning 
sense all alarm 
-5 marianne coloured and replied very hastily a where in l 7 
up said not you know a aid willoughby that we had been out in my curriclel a yes yes mr imprudence i know that very well and l wan determined to and out where on had been to 
i hare you like your home in anne 
it in a very large one i know and when i come to see you i hope you will have new-fumiuhed it for it wanted it very much when i was there six year a no 
gmarianne turned away in great confusion 
mr jennings laughed heartily 
and elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been she had actually made her own woman inquire of mr willaughhy’r groom and that the had by that method been informed that they had gone to allenham and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house 
elinor could hardly believe this to be true a it seemed likely that fellow he should m or maxim consent to enter the home while smith was in it with whom marianne had not the male acquaintance 
a 
soon as they left the dining-room elinor inquired of her about it 
and great vex her surprise when the found that every circumstance related by my jennings was perfectly true 
marianne wan quite an by with her for doubting it 
why ihould you imagine elinor that we did not go there or that we did not see the house 
ii not it what on have often wished to do yourself 
a as marianne but i would not go while smith was there and with no other companion than mr willoughby 
mr willoughby however in the only person who by sense and sunsrolu'rv 
can have a right to draw that home 
and heat in an open oln'iage it we impossible to have any other com nion 
i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life 
i am afraid a replied elinor that the plenumneea of an employment doe 
not always evince its propriety 
on the contrary nothing can be a stronger proof of it elinor 
for if there had been real impropriety in what i did i should have been sensible of it at the time for we always know when we are acting wrong and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure a but my dear marianne a it has already expand on to some very impertinent remarks do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct 
if the impertinent remarks of mrs jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct we are all offending every moment of all our lives 
i value not her censure any more than i should do her commend tion 
i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mr 
smith grounds or in seeing her home 
they will one day be mr willoughby and 
— a if they were one do to be your own marianne you would not be justified in what you have done 
she blushed at thin hint 
but it was even vitiny gratifying to her 
and after a ten minutes interval of earnest thought she came to her inner again and laid with great good humour “perhapl elinor it war rather ill-judged in me to go to allenham 
but mr willoughby wanted particularly to allow me the place 
and it is a charming home i assure you 
there in one remarkably pretty sitting-room upstairs of a nice comfortable size for constant use and with modern fumiture it would be delightful 
it is a corner room guns and snusrnxurv 
by and has windows on two sides 
on one side you look across the bowling-green behind the house to a beautiful hanging wood 
and on the other have a view of the church and village and on them of those one hold hills that we have so i admired 
i did not see it so advantage for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture 
but if it were newly fitted up 
of couple of hundred pounds willoughby says would make it one of the pleasantest summer-rooms in england could elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others she would have described every room in the house with equal delight 
hum 1814 
he sudden termination of colonel andon’s visit at the park with his steadiness in concealing its cause pulled the mind and raised the wonder of mrs jennings for two or three days she was a great wavered as ever one must be who takes a very lively interest in the coming and goings of all their acquaintance 
she wondered with little intermission what could he the reason of it 
was sure there must be some bad news and thou ht over every kind of distress that could have bele en him with a fixed determination that he should not escape them all 
something very melancholy must be the matter i am sure a said she 
i could see it in his face 
poor man 
i am afraid his circumstances may he had 
the same at delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year and his brother left everything sadly involved 
i do think he must have been sent for about to sense and sensibili'i'v 
money taste for what else can it be 
i wonder whether it is no 
i would give anything to know the truth of it 
perhaps it is about miss illiaand by the bye i dare say it it became he looked in conscious when i mentioned her 
may she it ill in town 
nothing in the world more likely for i have a notion the is always a rather sickly 
i would lay any wager it is about in william 
it is not so very likely he should be distressed in hit circumstancel sum for he is a very prudent man and to be cure must have cleared the male b this time 
i wonder what it can be 
make his sister is worse at avignon sod ha sent for him over 
hit setting off in such ahurry seems very like it 
well i wish him out of all hit trouble with all my heart and a good wife into the bargain so wondered so talked mrs jennings 
her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture and all seeming equally probable as they arose 
elinor though she felt really interested in the welfare of colonel brandon could not bestow all the wonder on his going to enddenly away which mrs jennings was desirous of her feeling 
for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation her wonder was otherwise disposed of 
it was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and willoughby on the subject 
which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them all 
an this silence continued every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the did tone of both 
why they should not i only known edge to her mother and herself what their constant behaviour to each other declared to have taken place elinor could not imagine 
she could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power 
for though willoughby was independent there was no reason to believe him rich 
his estate had been rated by sir john at about six or sense and sensibility 
7 i seven hundred a year 
but he lived at an sex to which that score could hardly be equal a he had himself often complained of his 
poverty 
but for thin strange kind of secrecy maintained by them relative to their en event which in fact concealed nothing at all the so d not account 
and it was no wholly contradictory of their general opinions and practice that a doubt oometimee entered her mind of their being really engaged and this doubt wan enough to prevent her making any inquiry of marianne 
nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all then willoughhy’n behaviour 
to marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover heart could give and in the mat of the family it wan the affectionate attention of a m and a brother 
the cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home 
many more of his 
hour were spent there than at allenham 
and if no general engagement collected them at the park the exercise which called him out in the morning wan almost certain of ending there where the rest of the day was spent by himself as the tide of marianne and by his favourite point at her feet 
one evening in particular about a week aﬂercolonel brandon had felt the country his heart seemed more than usually open to ever feeling of attachment to the objects around him 
an on mr duhwood’e happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring he warmly hﬂamed every alteration of a place which aﬁ'ection enahliehed as perfect with him 
what 
4 he exclaimed 
a improve this dear cottage 
no 
it i will never consent to 
not a none must be added to its walls not an inch to in rite if my feelings are regarded.” do not be alarmed said miss dashwood 12 sense and sensibility 
a nothing of the kind will he done 
for my mother will never have me enough to attempt it 
i am he by glad of it a he cried 
“mayshe alwa s be poor if the can employ her riches no better thank you willoughby 
but you may be assured that i would not sacriﬁce one sentiment of cool attachment of yours or of anyone whom i loved for all the improvements in the world 
depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain when i make up my accounts in the spring i would even rather la it useless 
by than dispute of it in a manner so into to you 
lines are you really so attached to this act as to see no defect in it i 
i am a said he 
to me it is limitless 
nay more i consider it as the only form of building to which happiness is attainable 
and were i rich enough i would instantly pull borne down and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage 
4 with dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that struck i suppose said elinor 
a yes cried he in the same eager tone 4 with all and everything belonging to it 
— in no one convenience or inconvenience about it should the least variation be perceptible 
then and then only under such a of might perhaps be as happy at table as i have been at barton 
a i flatter myself a replied elinor 
that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase you will hereafter and your own house as faultless as you now do this 
a there certainly are circumstances said willoughby which might greatly endear it to me 
but this place will always have one claim on my affection which no other can any share 
mrs dashwood looked with pleasure at marianne whose ﬁne eyes were fixed so expressively on sense and smsimurv 
13 willoughby s plainly denoted how well she understood him 
how often did i wish added he 
when i was at allenham this came twelvemonth that barton cottage were inhabited 
i never passed within view of it without admiring its situation and grieving that no one should live in it 
how little did i then think that the very first news i should hear from mrs smith when i next came into the country would be that barton cottage was taken 
and i felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event which nothing but a kind of presence of what happiness i should experience from it can account for 
must it not have been so marianne i 
speaking to her in a lowered voice 
then continuing his former tone he mind and yet this home you would spoil mrs dashwood 
you would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement 
and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance iint began and in which so many happy hours have been since it i 
us together you we d degree to the condition of a common entrance and everybody would be eager to pass through by the room which has hitherto contained within its more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could poniny afford 
mr dashwood again natured him that no alteration of the kind should be attempted 
you are a good woman a he warmly replied 
you promise makes me easy 
extend it a little farther and it will make me happy 
tell me that not only our house will remain the same but that i shall ever and you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling 
and that you will always considered me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me 
the praise was readily given and willoughby’u 74 snusr-z and snusrnru'rv 
behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness 
a shall we see you to-morrow to dinner 2 a mind an dashwood when he was leaving them 
a i do not ask you to come in the morning for we must walk to the park to call on lady middleton he engaged to he with them by four o'clock 
hum 
he 
mrs dashwood’s visit to lady middleton took place the next day and two of her daughters went with her 
but marianne excused herself from being of the party under name trifling presents of sam loyment 
and her mother who concluded that a promise had been made in willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent 
waperfecd fatigued with her remaining at home 
on their return am the park they found willoughby’l curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage and mr dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just 
so far it wan all as she had foreseen 
but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect 
they were no sooner in the passage than marianne came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent action with her handkerchief at her eyes and without noticing them run upetaira 
surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted where they found only willoughby who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his back towards them 
he turned round on their coming in and his countenance showed that he strongly pack of the emotion which overpowered marianne 
sense and sensibility 
15 
is anything the matter with her i cried mrs dashwood as she entered 
a is the ill 
i hope not he replied trying to look cheerful 
and with a forced smile presently added a it is i who may rather expect to be ill 
for i am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment 
disap intment 
7 a yes or i am unable to keep my engagement with mrs smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor d ent cousin by sending me on business london 
have just received my despatch and taken my farewell of allenham 
and by way of explanation i am now come to take my furcwcl of you 
7 a to london l 
and are you going this morning in a almost this moment 
this is very unfortunate 
but mr smith must be obliged 
and her business will not detain you from us long i hope 
he coloured as he replied a you are very kind but i have no idea of returning into devonlhire immediately 
my visits to mrs smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth 
a and is mrs smith your only friend 
is allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome 
for shame willoughby 
can you wait for an invitation here 2 3 his colour increased 
and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied a you are too good 
mr dashwood looked at elinor with surprise 
elinor felt equal amazement for a few moments every one was silent mrs dashwood ﬁrst kc 
i have only to add my dear wife ought that at barton cottage you will always be welcome 
for i will not press you to return here immediatel because you only can judge how far that might be put ceasing to mr 76 sense and sensibility 
smith 
and on this head i shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination 
a my engagements at present a replied willoughby confusedly 
are of such a nature 
that 
i dare not flatter myself 
— he stopt 
mrs dashwood was too much astonished to speak and another pause succeeded 
this was broken by willoughby 
who said with a faint smile a it is folly to linger in this manner 
i will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy he then hastily took leave of them all and left the room 
they saw him step into his carriage and in a minute it was out of sight 
mrs dashwood felt too much for speech and instantly quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned 
elinor’s uneasiness was at least equal to her mother 
she thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust 
willoughby’s behaviour in taking leave of them his embarrassment and expectation of cheerfulness and above all his unwillingness to accept her mother invitation a backwardness so unlike a lover 
so unlike himself greatly disturbed her 
one moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side 
and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister 
the distress in which marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for 
though when she considered what marianne’s love for him was a quarrel seemed almost am able 
but whatever might be the parties are of their separation her sisters application was indubitable 
and she thought with the tenderest com season of that violent sorrow which marianne was in all probability not merely guns and sensibility 
25 giving way to as relief but feeding and encouraging as a u 
in atlysout half an hour her mother returned and though her eyes were red her countenance was not uncheerful 
a our dear willoughby is now some miles from barton elinor said she as she sat down in work and with how heavy a heart does he travel s a 
it is all very strange 
so suddenly to be gone 
it seems butthe work of a moment 
and last night was with us so happy so cheerful so affectionate 
and now after only ten minutes notice-gone me without intending to return 
something more than what he owned to us must have happened 
he did not speak he did not behave like himself 
say must have seen the difference as well a i 
what can it be 
can they have uarrelledi why else should he have shown such unwillingness to accept your invitation here 
— a it was not inclination that he wanted elinor 
i could plainly see ibat 
he had not the power of accepting it 
i have thought it all over i assure you and i can perfectly account for everything that at rest seemed strange to me as well as to you a can you indeed i 
yes 
i have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way 
— 
but you elinor who love to doubt where you can 
it will not satisfy you i know 
but you shall not talk in out of my trust in it 
i am persuaded that mrs smith suspects his regard for marianne disapprove of it 353mm because she has other views for him and on t account is eager to get him away 
— and that the business which she sends him off to translate is invited as an excuse to dismiss him 
this is what i believe to have happened 
he is moreover aware that she does disapprove the connexion he dares 18 sense and snusmu'rv 
not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with marianne and he feel himself obliged from his dependent situation to give into her scheme and absent himself from devonahire for a while 
you will tell me i know that thin may or may not have happened 
but i will listen to no cavil unleeeyou can point outnny other method of understanding the affair as aatiafactnry as this 
and now elinor what have you to any 
a 
nothing for you have anticipated my only/er.” 1 then you would have told me that it might or might not have happened 
oh 
elinor how incomprehemibk are your feelings 
you had rather take evil upon credit than good 
you had rather look out for mary for marianne and guilt for poor willoughby than an apology for the latter 
you are resolved to think him blameable became he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour haehown 
and is no allowance to be made for inndvertence 
or far epirite deprived by recent disappointment 
are no probabilities to be accepted merely became they are not certaintiel 
in nothing due to the man whom we have all i 
much reason to love and no mean in the world to think ill of 
to the possibility of motive 
unamwemble in themselves though unavoidably acre for a while 
and after all what in it you rupee him of 
i can hardly tell you myself 
but suspicion of nothing unpleasant is the inevitable con sense of such an alteration an we have just wit in him 
there it great truth however in what you have now urged of the allowance 
which ought to be made for him and it it my wish to be candid in my judgment of everybody 
though may undoubtedly have very sufficient means for his conduct and i vii hope that he hat 
but it would have been more like willoughby to acknowledge them at once 
secrecy my be adviesense and senslblllty 
-5 able 
but still i can not help wondering at its being practised by him a do not blame him however for darting from his character when the deviation is necessary 
but you really do admit the justice of what i have said in his defence 
— i am happy 
and he is acquitted.” a not entirely 
it may be proper to conceal their engagement if they are engaged from mrs smith 
and if that is the case it must be highly expedient for willoughby to be but little in devomhire at present but this is no excuse for their concealing it from us 
concealing it from all my dear child do you accuse willoughby and marianne of concealment 
this is strange indeed when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousnem 
i want no proof of their affection 3 said elinor 
a but of their engagement i do a i am perfectly satisfied of both yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject by either of them 
i have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly 
has not his behaviour to marianne and to all of us for at least the last fortnight declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation 
have we not perfectly understood each other 
has not my consent been daily asked by his looks his manner his attentive and affectionate respect 
my elinor is it possible to doubt their engagement 
how could such a thought occur to you 
how is it to he supposed that willoughby persuaded as he must he of your sisters love should d leave her and leave her perhaps for months without telling her of his all'ecu'on 
— 
that they should part without a mutual exchange of conﬁdence.” 
i confess a replied elinor that every circum80 sense and sensiiiili‘i'v 
ﬁance except one it in favour of an engagement but that an is the total silence of both on the object and with me it almost outweighevery other a how strange this is 
you must think wretchedly indeed of willoughby if after ill that ha openly between them you can doubt the nature the terms on which they are together 
has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all thin time 
do you in pane him really indiﬁmnt to her 
7 a no i can not think that 
he must and do 
love her i am sure but with a range kind of gentlemen if he can leave her with such indifference tuch careleuneu of the future as you attribute to him 
a you must remember my dear mother that i have never considered thin matter as certain 
i have had my doubts i confess 
but they are fainter than they were and they may noon be entire 
done away 
if we find they correspond every fear of mine will be removed 
7 a mighty conceuion indeed 
if you were to see them at the altar you would suppose that they were going to be married 
ungracimu girl i but i require no lucl‘l roof 
nothing in my opinion ha ever paused to justify doubt 
no secret ha 
been attempted 5 all has been uniformly open and unreserved 
you can not doubt your sisters wishes 
it must be willoughby therefore whom you expect 
but why 
is he not a man of honour and feeling 
has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alum 
can he be deceitful 
a i he not i believe not cried elinor 
a i love willoughby y sincerely love him 
and on son of hit integrity can not be more painful to yourself than to me 
it has been involuntary and i will not encourage it 
i wan startled i confess by the alteration in his manner this morning 
he did not speak like himself and did sense and snitsrsan-v. 81 not return your kindness and with cordial 
but all this may be explained by such a situation a his affairs as you have supposed 
he had just parted from my james had seen her leave him in the greatest afﬂiction 
and if he felt obliged from a fear of offending mrs smith to resist the temptation of returning here soon and yet aware that by declining your invitation by saying that he was going away for some time he should seem to act an ungenerous a suspicious part by our family he might well be embarrassed and disturbed 
in arch a case a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour i think as well as more consistent with his general character z 
it i will not raise objections against any one conduct on so illiberal in foundation s a difference in judgment from myself or a deviation from what i may think right and consistent 
a you k her so i 
willoughb certainly does not one toyb siifpeyeted 
though we miss not known him long 
he is no stranger in this part of the world 
and who has ever men to his disadvantage 
had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once but this is not the case 
it is an engagement in some respects not prosperoust begun for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance 
and even secrecy as far as it can be observed may now be very advisable 
they were interest by the entrance of margaret 
and elinor was then at i to think over the presentation of her mother to acknowledge e the probability of many and hope for the justice ofal 
they saw nothing of variance till dinner time when she entered the room and took her place at the table without saying a word 
her eyes were red and swollen 
i. i 82 sense and srmsmu'rv 
and it seemed a if her nearer even then restrained with difficulty 
she avoided the looks of them all could neither eat nor speak and after came time on her mother iilently pressing her hand with tender companion her small degree of fortitude wu quit overcome 
the burst into tears and left the room this violent operation of spirits continued the whole evening 
she wan without any power became the was without any desire of command over herself 
the slightest mention of anything relative to willoughby overpowered her in an instant 
and though her family were most anxiously attentive to her comfort it up impb‘o table for them if they kept at all to keep clear of every subject which her feelings connected with him 
cblvm £171 marianne would have thought herself very excusable had she been able to sleep at s the first night after parting from willoughby 
she would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning had she not arisen from her bed in more need of repose than when the lay down in it 
but the feelings which made such compo-inc a disgrace 
left her in no danger of inquiring it 
she wan awoke the whole night and the wept the greatest part of it 
she or up with a headache wan unable to talk and unwise sing to take any nourishment 
giving pain e moment to her mother and sisters and forbidding attempt at consolation from either 
her sensibility woe potent enough 
when breakfast was over she walked out by herself and wandered about the village of allenham indulging the recollection of part enjoyment and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning

and thin nouriuhment of grief was every day applied 
she spent whole hour at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying her voice often totally suspended by her tears 
in books too as well at in mimic the courted the which a contract between the put and present was certain of giving 
she read nothing but what they had been used to read together 
such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever 
it sunk within a few day into a calmer melancholy 
but these employment to which the daily secured her solitary walks and silent meditations i produced occasional effusions of sorrow a lively an ever 
no letter from willoughby came and none leemed ex tied by marianne 
her mother wan risked an elinor again became uneaay 
but mr d wood could and explanation whenever the wanted them which at lean natiaﬁed hemlf 
a remember elinor laid the how very often sir john fetches our letterhinuelf from the poet and carried them to it 
we have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through sir john’l hands.” elinor could not deny the truth of thin and like tried to and in it a motive mﬂicient for their silence 
but there was one method to direct to simple and in her a unison no eligible of knowing the reel late of the a s and of instantly removing all misery that she could not help suggesting it to her mother

and sensibility 
why do you not ask marianne at once a aid she a whether the in or in not engaged to willoughby from you her mother and to kind to indulgent a mother the question could not give offence 
it would be the natural result of your affection for her 
she need to be all unreserve and to you more especially 
i would not ask inch 3 quenion for the world 
supposing it be that they are not engaged what distress would not such an inquiry inﬂictl at any rate it would be most generous 
i should never deserve her confidence again after forcing from her a confession of what in mean at present to be unacknowledged to any one 
i know marianne’s heart i know that she dearly love me and that i shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known when circummncea make the resentment of it eligible 
i would not attempt to force the confidence of any one of a child much less became a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct.” elinor thought thin generosity overltnined considering her sister youth and urged the matter farther but in vain 
common sense common care common eyes were all aunt in my dashwood’u romntic de icacy 
it was several day 
before willoughby’e name was mentioned before marianne b any of her family 
sir john and mr jennings in need were not to nice 
their witticilrne added pain to many a painful honr 
— but one evening my dashwood accidentally taking up a volume of baker are exclaimed we have never wished hamlet marianne 
our dear willoughby went away before we could get through it

but it may be most perhaps before be

nor many weeks 
sense and sensrnru'rr 
m 85 mrs dashwood was sorry for what she had said 
but it gave elinor pleasure as it produced a t from marianne so expressive of confidence in w ought and knowledge of his intentions 
one morning about a week after his leaving the country marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk instead of wandering away by herself 
hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in her rambles 
if her sisters intended to walk on the bows she directly stole away towards the lanes if they talked of the valley the was as speedy in climbing e hills 
and could never be found when the others set off 
but at length she was secured by the exertions of elinor who great disapproved ouch continual seclusion 
they walked along the road through the valley and chiefly in silence for marianne’s mind could not be continued and elinor satisfied with gaining one point would not then attempt more 
beyond the entrance of the valley where the country though still rich was less wild and more eyes a long stretch of the end which they had travel on first coming to barton lay before them 
and on reaching that point they stopped to look around them and examine a prospect which formed the distance of their view from the cottage from a mat which they had never happened to reach in any of their walks before 
amongst the objects in the scene they soon discovered in arm one 
it was a man on horseback riding towards them 
in a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman 
and in a moment afterwards marianne rapturoualy exclaimed it is he 
it is indeed 
— i know it is 
a 
and w hastening to meet him when elinor cried out a indeed marianne s think you are mistaken 
it is not willoughby

v rs dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him 
for his coming to barton was in her opinion of all things the most natural 
her joy and expressions of regard long outlived her wonder 
e received the kindest welcome from her 
and shyness coldness reserve 
could not stand against such a reception 
they had begun to fail him before he entered the house and they were quite overcome by the ca ivating manners of mr dashwood 
indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters without extending the passion to her 
and elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him won become more like himself 
his sﬁ'ectiom seemed to estimate towards them all and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible 
he was not in spirits however 
he praised their house admired its prospect was attentive and kind 
but still he was not in spirits 
the whole family perceived it and mrs dashwood attributing it to some want of libenlit in his mother sat down to table indignant against all fish parents

but like everybody clue it must be in my own way 
greatness will not make me so 
a strange if it would 
a cried marianne 
what have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness l 7 a grandeur had but little a sad elinor but wealth has much to do with it 
a elinor for iharnel 3 said marianne 
money can only give happiness where there ll nothing else to give it 
beyond a competence it can afford no real satisfaction at far as mere self in concerned.” perhaps a said elinor lmiling 1 we may come to the same point 
tour competence and my wealth are very much alike i dare say 
and without them an the world goes now we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting 
your ideas are only more noble than mine 
come what in your competence 2 a labour eighteen hundred or two thousand a year 
not more than that

you are very right in supposing how my money would be t 
some of it at eat my love cult would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and boys 7 a and the talk of your fortune would be laid out in enquiries on the author or their heirl.” “no edward i should have something clue to do with it a perhaps then you would bestow it up a reward on that person who wrote the table defence of your favourite maxim that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life

sometimes talk a great deal and always with animation 
but he in not often really merry 
i believe you are right 4 he replied and yet i have always yet her down an a lively girl 5 i have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes 3 said elinor 2 in a total minpprehemion of sense and sensibility

fancying leno much more gay or grave or ingenioue or mpi than they really are and i can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated 
sometimes one in guided by what they lay of themselves and very frequently by what other people say of them within giving one f lime to delay rate and judge

a i am going into the village to lee my horses a laid he can you are not 
yet ready for breakfast 
i shall be back again presently 
edward returned to them with each admiration of the surrounding country 
in hit walk to the village he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage 
and the village self in a much higher situation than the cottage afforded a general view of the whole which had exceedingly pleased him 
thin was a subject which inlured mananne'l attention and she wan beginning to describe her own admiration of these events and to question him more minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him when edward interrupted her laying 
you must 
not inquire too far marianne

one too because you admire 
i can only believe it to be full of rocks and promontoriel grey moand brushwood buttheseareallloetonme 
know nothing of the picturesque i am afraid it is but too true said marianne 
but why should you boast of it 
a i inspect 3 said elinor what to avoid one kind of nﬂ'cctntion edward here fall into another 
because hr.believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel and it disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than she he ll fastidious and will have an aﬁ'ectau'on of his own 
a it is very true laid marianne a that admiration of landacnpe uenery it become a mere urgon 
everybody pretend to feel and tried to describe with the master and e elegance of him who lint deﬁned what picturesque beauty was 
i detect as a of every kind and sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself because i could and no language to describe them in but what we worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning 5 i am convinced said edward 7 that you really feel all the delight in a one respect which on profess to feel 
but in return your after must allow me to feel no more than i profess 
i like a one prospect but not on picturesque principles 
i do not like crooked twisted hlaeted trees 
i admire them much more if they are tall right and ﬂourishing 
i doubt like ruined tattered cottages 
i am not fond of nettles or thistles or heath blouoms 
i have more pleasure in a snug farm-house than a watchtower 
end a two of tidy happy villagers please me better than the rest dirt in the world 
marianne looked with amazement at edward with compassion at her anger 
elinor only laughed 
sense and sensibility 
6 the subject was continued no farther 
and marianne remained thoughd‘ully silent all a new object mddenl enga led her attention 
she was sitting down and in taking his tea from mrs dash his hand passed so directly before her as to make a ring with a plain of hair in the centre very conspicuous on one of his anger 
a i never saw you wear a ring before edward 7 she cried 
is that fanny hair 
i remember her promising to give you some 
but i should have thought her hair had been darker.” marianne spoke inconsiderater what she really felt 
but when she saw how much she had need edward her own vexation at her want of those r. could not be surpassed by his 
he coloured very deeply and giving a momentary glance at elinor rep died a as it is my sister s hair 
he setting always cases a different shade on it you know elinor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise 
that the hair was her own she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as marianne 
the only difference in their conclusions was that what marianne 
considered as a free gift from her sister elinor was conscious must have been procured by some the or contrivance unknown to herself 
she was not in s humour however to regard it as an affront and affecting to take no notice of what had passed by instantly taken of something else she internally resolved henc forward to catch every ofpommity of eyeing the hair and satisfying herself beyond all doubt that it was exactly the shade of her own 
edward’s embarrassment lasted some time and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled 
he was particularly grave the whole momin 
marianne severely censured herself for what she has said 
but her own i. g or sense and srmsrnm-rv 
forgiveness might have been more eyes had the known how little silence it had given her sister 
before the middle of the day they were visited by sir john and mr jennings who having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage came to take a survey of the sum with the distance of hit mother-in-law sir john was not long in discovering that the name of ferraro began with an f and thin repaired a future mine of raillery against the devoted elinor which nothing but the newness of their acquaintance with edward could have prevented from being immediately sprung 
but an it was the only learned from some very significant looks how for their station founded on mnrgalet’l imtructionl extenm sir john never came to the dashwood without either inviting them to dine at the park the next day or to drink tea with them that evening 
on the present occasion for the better entertainment of their visitor towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute he wished to engage them for both 
you mr drink tea with in to-night laid he for we shall be quite alone 
and to-morrow you a most nboolurely dine with us for we shall be a large a 4 pain jennings enforced the necessity 
and who know but you may raise in dance 
laid the 
and that will tempt you miss marianne 
a dance 
a cried marianne 
impossible 
a who in to dance 
a two 
why yourselves and the cares and whitnkerr to he sure 
what 
you thought nobody could dance because i cumin person that ball be names in gone 
a i will with all my soul cried sir john that willoughby were among us again 
sense and sensibility 
so this and marianne’s blushin gave new to edward 
a and who is wise oughby 
a said he in a low voice to miss dashwood by whom he was sitting 
she gave him a brief reply 
marianne’l countenance was more communicative 
edward saw enough to comprehend not only the meaning of others but much of marianne’s expressions as had puzzled him before 
and when their minds left them he went immediately round her and laid in a whisper i have been guessed 
shall i tell you my guess 
a hat do our mean 
a shall i tell you 
certainly a well then i guess that mr willoughby hunts 
marianne was surprised and confused yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner and after a moment s silence said “ohl edward 
how can you up 
but the time will come i hope 
i am sure you will like him 
i do not doubt it replied he rather astonished at her earnestness and warmth 
for had he not imagined it to he s joke for the good of her acquaintance in general founded only on a something or a nothing seen mr willoughby and herself he would not have ventured to mention it 
hum 53 
towards remained a week at the cottage 
he was earnestly pressed by mrs dashwood to stay longer 
but as if he were bent only on self-mortiﬁcation he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height 
his loo sense and sbnsibiuty 
maria during the in two or three days though still very unequal were greatly improved 
she grew more and more partial to the house and environs 
never spoke of going away without a tie his 
declared his time to be wholly disengaged 
even used to what place he should go when he left them 
but still go he must 
never had any week passed so quickly 
he could hardly believe it to be gone 
he said so repeatedly 
other things he said too which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions 
he had no pleasure at norland 
be detected being in town 
but either to norland or london he must go 
he valued their kindness beyond anything and his greatest happiness in being with them 
yet he must leave them at the end of a week in spite of their wishes and his own and without any restraint on his time 
elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother's account 
and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known m her as to he the general excuse for everything strange on the part of her son 
its pointed however and vexed as she was and sometimes pleased with his uncertain behaviour to herself 
she very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualiﬁcations which had been rather more painfully extorted from her for willoughby s service by her mother 
his want of spirits of openness and of consistency were most usually attributed to his want of independence and his better knowledge of mrs femrs’s dispositions and designs 
the shortness of his visit the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them originated in the same fettered inclination the same inevitable necessity of temporising with his mother 
the old well-cmblished grievance of but against will parent against child was the cause of all 
she would have been glad to know when these dilﬁculsense and sensibility 
5 on ties were to cease this opposition was to yield 
when mrs ferraro would be formed and her con be at l. to be happy 
but from inch vain wishes 
the was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in edward affection to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at barton and above all to that ﬂattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his anger 
i think edward 3 said mr dashwood as they were at breakfast the last morning you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plan and actions 
some inconvenience to your friends indeed might result from it 
you would not be able to give them so much of your time 
but with a smile you would be materially bench in one particular at least 
you would know where to go when you left them i do assure you he replied that i have long thought on this point as you think now 
it has been and is and probably will always be a heavy misfortunes me that i have had no necessary business to engage me no profession to give me am employment or afford me anything like independence 
last unfortunately in own nicety and the nicety of my friends have made me what i am an idle helpless being 
we never could agree in our choice of a profession 
i always preferred the church an i still do 
but that was not part enough for my family 
they recommended the army 
that was a great deal too smart for me 
the law wan allowed to be genteel enough 
many young men who had chambers in the temple made a very good appearance in the first circles and drove about town in very knowing gigs 
but i had no inclination for the law even in this less abstruse study of it which my family approved 
a for the navy it had fashion on its side of sense and sensibility 
but i wan too old when the subject rm first named to enter it 
and at length at then wan no neecuit for my having any profession at all as i might be an fishing and expenses without a. red coat on my back a with one idle wan pronounced on the whole to be the most advantageous and honourable and a young man of eighteen in not in general it eameuly bent on being buy no to resist the solicitation 
of hit friend to do nothing 
i was therefore entered at oxford and have been properly idle ever since 
the consequence of which 
suppose will be a laid on dashwood “since secure all not promoted your own happiness that your son will be brought up to at many pursuiu employmente profession and shades on collumella’a 
they will be brought up a said he in a serious accent to be as unlike myself as in pom'ble 
in feeling in action in condition in every 
a me come 
this all an effusion of immediate want of spirits edward 
you are in a melancholy humour and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy 
but remember that the pain of parting from friend will be felt by every body at times whatever be their education or state 
now your own happiness 
you want nothing but patience 
or give it a more fascinating name call it hope 
your mother will secure to you in time that independence you are no anxious for 
it in her duty and it will it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent 
how much my not a few months do 
7 a i think a replied edward that i may defy many month m pmrlucu any good to me 
this deeponding turn of mind though it could not be communicated to mrs dashwood gave additional pain to them all in the parting which shortly took place sense and sensibility 
of and left an uncomfomble impression on elinor’s feelings by which required name trouble and form to us 
but an it was her determination to subdue it and to prevent herself from a ring to suffer more than what all her family ruﬂ'erecinf his going away she did not adopt the method no judiciou y employed by marianne on a similar occasion to augment and fix her now by seeking silence solitude and idleness 
their meant were as different an their objects and equally united to the advancement of each 
elinor sat down to her drawing-table a. took a he was out of the home busily sam loud herself the whole day neither sought nor avoid the mention of his name appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general concern of the family and if by thin conduct she did net lessen her own grief it was at least prevented from unneceuary increase and her mother and sisters were spared much solicitude on her account 
such behaviour an this so exactly the reverie of her own appeared no more meritorious to marianne than her own had seemed faulty to her 
the huainmof self-command the settled very c lsily 
— with strong affections it was impossible with calm once it could have no merit 
that her airs affections were calm the dared not deny though she blushed to acknowledge it 
and of the strength of her own the gave a very striking proof by still loving and respecting that sister in it of thin mortifying conviction 
without shutting herself up from her family or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them or laying awake the whole night to indulge meditation elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of edward and of edward’s behaviour in every possible variety which the silent rate of her spirit at different time could produce 
— with tenderness 104 sense and sensibility 
pity approbation censure and doubt 
there were moments in abundance when if not by the absence of her mother and listen at least i the nature of their e loymenu conversation was forbidden among them every effect of solitude was produced 
her mind was inevitably at liberty 
her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere 
and the past and the future on a subject so interesting must be before her must force her attention and engross her merely her reflections and her fancy 
from a reverie of this kind as she sat at her drawing-table the was used one morning soon after edward s leaving them by the arrival of company 
she happened to be quite alone 
the closing of the little gate at the entrance of the green court in front of the house drew her eyes to the window and she saw a large part walking up to the door 
amongst them were sir john and lady middleton and mrs jennings 
but there were two others a gentleman and lady who were quite unknown to her 
she was sitting near the window and as soon as sir john perceived her he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door and stepping across the turf obliged her to open the casement to speak to him though the space was so short between the door and the window as to make it hardly possible to speak at one without being heard at the other 
well a said he we have brought you some strangers 
how do you like them 
a bush 
they will hear you 
a never mind if they do 
it is only the palmer 
charlotte is very pretty i can tell you 
you may see her if you look this way as elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes without taking that liberty she begged to be excused 
sense and sensibhjty 
105 a where is marianne 
has she run away because we are come 
i see her instrument is spent a she is walking i believe they were now joined by mrs jennings who had not patience enough to wait till the door was open before she told bar story 
she came hallooing to the window a how do you do my dear 
how does mrs dashwood do 
and where are your sisters 
what 
all alone 
you will be glad of a little company to sit with you 
i have brought my other son and draw her lose you 
011 think of their coming so so early 
i thought i rode a carriage last night while we were drinking our tea but it never entered my had that it could be them 
i thought of nothing but whether it might not be colonel brandon come back again 
so i aid to sir john i do think i hear a carriage a 
perhaps it is colonel brandon come back a sun 8 elinor was obliged to turn from her in the middle of her story to receive the rest of the party 
lady middleton introduced the two strangers 
mrs dashwood and margaret came downstairs at the same time and they all sat down to look at one another while mr jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour attended by sir john 
mrs palmer was several years younger than lady middleton and totally unlike her in every respect 
she was short and plump had a very pretty face and the rest expression of good humour in it that could possibly be 
her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister s but they were much more prepoasessing 
she came in with .1 smile 
smiled all the time of her visit except when she laughed and smiled when she went away 
her husband was a grave looking young man of vex or six and twenty with an air of more on and sense than his wife but of less willingness to please i or sense and sensibility 
or to be placed 
he entered the room with a look of self 
consequence slightly bowed to the ladies without taking a word and after brieﬂy surveying them and i apartments took up a newspaper from the table and continued to read it as long as he mind 
mrs palmer on the contrary who was strongly endowed by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour and everything in it burst forth 
a well 
what a delightful room this is 
i never w anything so charming 
only think mamma how it is improved since i was here last 
i always i thought it such a sweet place ma’am turning to mrs dashwood but you have made it so charming 
only look sister how delightful everything is 
how should like such a house for myself 
should not you mr palmer 
a mr palmer made her no answer and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper 
a mr palmer does not hear me said she laughing 
4 he never does sometimes 
it is so ridiculous 
a this was quite a new idea to mrs dashwood 
she had never been used to and wit in the inattention of any one and could not help looking with surprise at them both 
mrs jennings in the meantime talked on as loud as she could and continued her account of their surprise the evening before on seeing their friends without ceasing till everything was told 
mrs palmer laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment and everybody agreed two or three times over that it had been quite an agreeable surprise 
a you may believe how glad we all were to see them a added mrs jennings leaning forward towards elinor and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard b no one else though they were seated on diﬂ'erent of a m t but however i can sense and sensibility 
107 help wishing they had not travelled quite so far nor made such a long journey of it for they came all round by london upon account of some lines for you know nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter it was wrong in her situation 
i wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning but she would come with us 
she longed so much to see you all 
a mrs palmer laughed and said it would not do her any harm 
a she expects to be continued in february continued mrs jennings 
lady middleton could no longer endure such a conversation and therefore exerted herself to ask mr palmer if there was any news in the paper 
a no none at all a he replied and read on 
a here comes marianne ’ cried sir john 
a now palmer you shall see a monstrous pretty girls he immediately went into the passage opened the front door and ushered her in himself 
my jennings asked her as soon as she a red if she had not been to allenham 
and mrs almer laughed so heartily at the question as to show she understood it 
mr palmer looked up on her entering the room stared at 
her some minutes and then returned to hit newspaper 
mr palmei’s eye was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room 
she got up to examine them 
oh 
dear how beautiful these are 
well how delightful 
do but look mamma how sweet 
i declare they are quite charming 
i could look at them for ever and then sitting down again she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room 
when lady middleton rose to go away mr palmer rose also laid down the newspaper stretched himself and looked at them all round 
:08 sense sun sensibility 
all my love have you been asleep 
a said his wife lauﬁllnng 
e made her no answer and only observed after again examining the room that it was very low-pitched and that the ceiling was looked 
he then made his bow and departed with the rest 
sir john had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at the park 
mrs dashwood who did not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined at the cottage absolutely refused on her own account 
her daughters might do as they pleased 
but they had no curiosity to see how mr and mrs palmer ate their dinner and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way 
they attem ted therefore likewise to excuse themselves 
the west her was uncertain and not likely to be good 
but sir john would not be satisfied 
— the carriage should be sent for them and they must come 
lady middleton too though she did not press their mother pressed them 
mrs jennings and mrs palmer joined their entreaties all seemed really anxious to avoid a family party and the younge‘ladies were obliged to yield 
a why should they ask us i said marianne as soon as they were gone 
6 the rent of this cottage is said to he now 
but we have it on very hard terms if we are dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them or with us 
a they mean no less to be civil and kind to us now a said elinor a by these frequent invitations than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago 
the alteration is not in them if their parties are grown tedious and dull 
we must look for the change elsewhere.

109 chapter i 
s the mine dashwood entered the drawing-room of the park the next day at one door my palmer came running in at the other looking a good-humoured and merry as before 
she took them all most aﬂ'eetionntely by the hand and expressed great delight in seeing them again 
i am so glad to see you 
aid she renting herself between elinor and marianne for it in no bad a day was afraid you might not come which would be a shocking thing at we go away again to 
sorrow 
we must go for the weston

there is not much difference 
i never was at his house 
but they lay it in a sweet pretty place

marianne remained perfectly evident though her countenance betrayed her interest in what was laid 
a is it very ugly 
a continued mrs palmer 
a then it must be some other place that is to pretty i sup one.” hen they were seated in the dining-room sir john observed with regret that they were only eight all together

charles laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid of her and exultingly laid he did not care how cross be was on her a they must live to

i was impossible for any one to be more thoroughly good-natured or more determined to be happy than mr palmer 
the studied indifference insolence in discontent of her husband gave her no pain 
and when he scolded or abused her the was highly diverted 
a s palmer in no droll s a said the in a whisper to elinor 
4 he is always out of humour 
elinor was not inclined after a little observation to give him credit for being so genteel and unafl'ecudly ill-nature or ill-bred as he wish to up as 
his temper might perhaps be a little secured by riding like many others of being ask that through some unaccountable him in favour of beauty he wan the husband of a very silly woman

however i am much happier a i am 
mr palmer is just the kind of man i like sense and sensibility 
i in chapter 5 
he palmer returned to cleveland the next day and the two families at barton were again left to entertain each other 
but this did not lam long 
elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head 
had hardly done wondering at charlotte’s being so happy without a cause at mr palmer’s acting so simply with good abilities and at the strange suitableness which often existed between husband and wife before sir john and mrs jennings’ active zeal in the cause of society procured her some other new acquaint» once to see and observe 
in a moment's excursion to exeter they had met with two young ladies whom mrs jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her relations and this was enough for sir john to invite them directly to the park as soon as their present en guests at exeter were over 
their engagements at exeter instantly gave way before such an invitation and lady middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the return of sir john by hearing that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life and of whose elegance 
whose tolerable gentility even she could have no proof 
for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for nothing at all 
they being her relations too trade it so much the worse 
and mrs jennings’ attempt at consolation were therefore unfortunate founded when she advised her daughter not to care about their being so fashionable because they were all cousins and must put up with one another 
as it was in his however now to prevent their coming lady middleton resigned herself to the idea of it with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman could 18 sense and sensibility 
seating himself with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject live or six times every day 
the young ladies arrived their appearance wan by no meanungenteel or unfashionablc 
their dress was very smart their manners very civil they were delighted with the home and in rapture with the where and they happened to be no doatingly fond of children that lady mlddlcton’l good opinion wan engaged in their favour before they had been an hour at the park 
she declared them to be very agreeable girl 
indeed which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration 
sir john’conﬁdence in hit own judgment robe with thin animated line and he net of directly for the cottage to tell the its dashwood of the mind suelct’ arrival and to nature them of their being the sweetest girl in the world 
from such commendation as this however there wan not much to be learned 
elinor well know that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met with in every part of england under every possible variation of for face temper and understanding 
sir john wanted the whole family to walk to the park directly and look at his guests 
benevolent philanthropic man 
it was painful to him even to keep a third cousins to himself 
a do come now a said he 
pray come 
must come 
i declare you shall come you can ask how you will like them 
lucy it monument pretty and so good-humoured and agreeable 
the children are all hanging about her already an if the wan an old acquaint» once 
and they both long to see you of all things for they have heard at exeter that you are the most beautiful crcnturcl in the world 
and i have told them it it all very true and a great deal more 
you will be delighted with them 1 am cure 
lucky lucky brought the whole conch full of playing for the children 
how can you be to crown at not to come 
why they sense and sensibility 
s are your mail you know after fen fashion 
to a cousins they are m wife s so must not r yes yes but sir john could not prevail 
he could only obtain i promise of their calling at the park within a day or two and then left them in amazement at their indifference to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the miss stcclcs as he had been already boasting of the miss steele to them 
when their promised visit to the park and conseglueot introduction to these young ladies took place ey found in the appearance of the eldest who was nearly thirty with a very plain and not a sensible face nothing to admire 
but in the other who was not more than two or three and twenty they acknowledged considerable beauty 
her features were pretty and she had a sharp quick eye and s partner of air which though it did not give actual elegance or grace gave distinction to her person 
their manners were particularly civil and elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense when she saw with what constant and judicious attentions they were making themselves agreeable to lady middleton 
with her children they were in continual raptures telling their beauty courting their notice and humour all their whims 
and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demand which this politeness made on it was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing if she happened to be doing anything or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceaaing delight 
fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles a and mother though in pursuit of noise for her children the most precious of human 
age is likewise the most scrupulous 
her demands are exorbitant 
but she will swallow anything 
and the 20 sense and sensibility 
excessive affection and endurance of the miss steele towards her spring were viewed therefore by lady middlmn without the smallest cu rioe or demurs 
she saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent ineronehmenn and miochievoua tricks to which her cousin tuhmitted 
she saw their sashes untied their hair pulled about their can their work-bagsearched and their knives and actually stolen away and felt no doubt of in being a reciprocal enjoyment

and her mouth stuffed with sugar-plums by the other 
with sense and sensibili‘i'v 
12 
each a reward for her seen the child was too wise to cease crying 
she still screamed and rubbed lunily kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her end all their united than were ineffectual till lady middleton luckily remem ring that in a scene of iirnilnr distress lm week some apricot marmalade had been succeufully applied for a raised temple the same remedy wan eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scotch and a slight intermission of scream in the young lady on hearing it gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected 
she was carried out of the room therefore in her mother arms in quest of this medicine and as the two boys chose to follow though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind the four young indeed were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours 
poor little creature 
a said miss steele 1 noon as they were gone 
a it might have been a very and accident yet i hardly know how cried marianne 
under it had been under totally different circumstances 
but thin is the usual way of heightening alarm where there is nothing to be nlamnxl at in reality 
by what a sweet woman lady middleton is laid luc steele 
anne was silent 
it was impossible for her to say what she did not feel however trivial the occasion 
and upon elinor 
therefore the whole talk of telling lies when politeness required it always fell 
she did her best when thus called on by speaking of lady middleton with more warmth than she felt though with far less than miss lucy 
a and sir john too a cried the elder sister a what a charming man he is 
a here too miss duhwood’s commendation being only simple and just came in without any class 
she i 2 
sense and sensibility 
merely observed that he wan perfectly good-humoured and friendly 
a and what it charming little family have 
i never law such line children in my lie 
declare i uite doat up them already and indeed i am always ittractedly and of children a i should guess so a said elinor with a smile a from what i have witnessed this morning i have a notion a raised lucy a you think the little middleton rather too much indulged 
perhaps they may be the outside of enough 
but it i 
no natural in lad middleton 
and for my part i love to lee child ran full of life and u‘pll'lll 
i can not hear them if they are tame and quiet a i confess 
replied elinor that while i am at barton park i never think of tame and quiet children with any nbhorrcnce.” a short aute tucceeded thin speech which was lint broken by in steele who seemed very much i for conversation and who now said rather abrupt and how do you like devonohire min draw up i suppose you were very sorry to leave sunex.” in some surprise at the familiarity of thin question 
or at least at the manner in which it war apolten elinor replied that the war 
a norland i 
a prodigious beautiful place it not it 2 added mist steele 
a we have heard sir john admire it exceuively a raised lucy who seemed to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister 
a i think every one arm admire it a lied elinor a who ever raw the place 
though it is not to be suppose that any one can estimate it beauties an we do and had you i great many smart beaux there 
i mppooc you have not to many in this part of the sense and sensible mtv 
la 23 world 
for my part i think they are a vast addition 21 a 
at why should you think a said lucy looking ashamed of her sister that there are not as many genteel young men in derbyshire as sussex 2 a nay in dear is sure i do n't pretend to say that there and 
am sure there a met many smart been in exeter 
but you know how could i tell what smart beaux there might be about norland 
and i was only afraid the miss dashwood might and it dull at barton if they had not so many as they used to have 
but perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux and had aslief be without them as with them 
for my part i think they are vastly a reeable provided they dress smart and behave civil 
us i can hear to see them dirty and nasty 
now there s mr rose at exeter a prodigious smart young man nice a bar clerk to mr simpson you know and yet i you do but meeting of morning he is not lit to be seen 
i up she your brother was quite a beau miss dashwood for he married as he was so rich in upon my word replied elinor i can not tell you for i do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word 
but this i can say that if he ever was as been before he married he is one kill for there is not the smallest alteration in him “oh 
dear 
one never thinks of married men’s being beam 
they have something else to do 
a lord 
anne a cried her sister a you can talk of nothing but beaux 
— you my ll make miss dashwood believe you think of nothing else and then to turn the discourse she began admiring the house and furniture 
this specimen of the miss steele was enough 
the vulgar freedom and fall of the eldest left her no recommendation and as elinor was not blinded by the 22nd sense and sensiihjtvv beauty or the threwd look of the youngest to her want of mr elegance and anlettnett the left the home without any with of knowing them better 
not to them steele 
they mine from exeter well provided with admiration for the use of sir john midd eton hit family and all hit relations and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to hit fair canine whom they declared to be the most bmutiﬁll elegant accomplished and agreeable girls they had ever beheld and with whom they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted 
and to better a minted therefore elinor soon found wan their evil let lot 
for to sir john will entirely on the tide of the miss smleo their puny would be too mung for opposition and that kind of intimacy must be submitted to which consists of sitting an hour or two together in the tame mom nhnott every day 
sir john could do no more 
but he did not know that any more was required 
to be together was in hit opinion to intimates and while hit continual schemes for their meeting were effectual he had not a doubt of their being establithed friends 
to do him justice he did every thing in hit war to promote their unreterve by may in the miss teelet acquainted with whatever he knew or to of his cousins situations in the man delicate pammlnm 
and elinor had not seen them more than twice before the eldest of them wished her joy on her titter’t having been so lucky an to make a conquest of i very man beau since the came to barton 
will be a one thing have her married trying to be sure a aid the hand i hear he it quite a beau and prodigiout handsome 
and i hope you may have at good luck yourself too 
but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already.” elinor could not suppose that sir john would be more nice in disclaiming hit opinion of her regard for sense and sensibility 
15 edward than he had been with respect to marianne 
indeed it was rather his favourite jo e of the two as being somewhat answer and more con turf and since edward’s visit they had never dinedletogether without his drinking to her best affections with so much signiﬁeancy and so man nods and thinks as to excite general attention 
tie letter f 
had been likewise invariably brought forward and found productive of such countless jokes that its character as the wisest letter in the alphabet had been long established with elinor the miss steele as she expected had now all the benefit of these jokes and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman alluded to which though often impertinently expressed was perfectly of a piece with her general inquiutiveness into the concert their family 
but sir john did not it long with the curiosity which he deli bred to raise or he had at least as much pleasure in self in the name as miss steele had in hearing it 
his name is ferraro 7 aid he in a very audible whisper 
but pray do not tell it for it a great seem a formal 
repeated miss steele 
our farmers is the happy man is he 
what 
your sister-imlsw’s brother ﬁrst dashwood a very agreeable young man to be sure 
i know him very well 
7 a how can you say so anne 
a cried lucy who generally made an amendment to all her sisters alertions 
though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle it is rather too much in pretended know him we well 
nor had all this with attention and surprise 
and who was this uncle 
where did he live 
how came they acquainted 
she wished very much to have the subject continued though she did not chose li6 sense and sensibility 
to being in it herself 
but nothing more of it was said an for the first time in her life she thought mrs jennings deficient either in curiosity after petty information or in a his situation to communicate it 
the manner in which in steele had spoken of edward increased her curiosity 
for it struck her as being rather ill-natured and suggested the suspicion of that lady knowing or fancy ng herself to know something to his disadvantage 
at her curiosity wan unwilling for no farther notice was taken of mr ferrari’s name by miss steele when alluded to or even openly mentioned by sir john 
chm ﬁll marianne who had never much toleration for in like impatience vulgari inferiority of parts or even difference of taste am here was at this time particularly ill-disposed 
from the state of her spirits to be pleased with the miss steele or to a encourage their advances 
and to the invariable coldness of her behaviour towards them which checked ever endeavour at intimacy on their side elinor principaily attributed that preference of herself which soon became evident in the manners of both but especially of lucy who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank communication of her sentiments 
lucy was naturally clever 
her remarks were often just and amusing 
and as a companion for half an hour elinor frequent yet found her agreeable 
but her powers had received no aid from education she was ignorant and illiterate and her deficiency of all mental improvement her want of information in the most common sense and sensible lity 
la 17 particularo could not be concealed from miss dashwood in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to advantage 
elinor us and pitied her for the neglect of abilities which education might have rendered no cable 
but she saw with less tendemeea of feeling the thorough want of delicacy of rectitude and integrity of mind which her attention 
her aniduitiee her ﬂatterieo at the park betrayed 
and due could have no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance whose want of innmction prevented their meeting in conversation on terms of equal pity and whom conduct towards other made every show of attention and deference toward herself perfectly valueleoa 
a you will think my quettion an odd one i dare lay laid lucy in her one day as they were walking together from the park to the cottage 
a but play are you personally acquainted with your litter-in-law’l mother on fen-are i a elinor ed think the question a very odd one and her countenance expressed it an the answer that 
she had never seen mr f erraru 
“indccdl” replied lucy 
i wonder at that for i thought you must have seen her at norland nometimeo 
then perhaps you can not tell me what none of a woman she is 
a no a returned elinor caution of giving her real opinion of edward’s mother and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity 
a i know nothing of her i am sure you think me very strange for inquiring about her in such a way a said lucy eyeing elinor attentively as she spoke 
but perhaps there may be reasono 
i wish i might venture 
but however i hope you will do me the justice of believing that i do not mean to be impertinently 128 sense and sensibility 
elinor made her a civil reply and they walked on for a few minutes in silence 
it was broken by lucy who renewed the subject again by saying with some hesitation 
a i can not hear to have-you think me impertinently curious 
i am sure i would rather do anything in the world than be thought so by a person whose and opinion is so well worth having as ours 
and am sure i should not have the natural est far of turning you indeed i should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such an income nahle situation as i am 
but however there is no occasion to trouble you 
i am sorry you do not happen to know mrs ferraro 
a i am sorry i do not a said elinor in great astonishment of it could be of any use to m to know my opinion of her 
but really i never understood that on were at all connected with that rarity and therefore i an a little surprised i confess at so serious an inquiry into her character i dare say upon are and i am sure i do not at all wonder atit 
at if i dared tell you all you would not be so much surprised 
mrs fear is certainly nothing to me at present 
but the time to come 
how soon it will come must depend upon herself 
when we may be very intimately connected 
she looked down as she said this amiable bashﬁrl with only one side-glance at her companion to observe its effect on her 
a good heavens 
cried elinor a what do mean 
are you acquainted with mr robert femrs 
can you be in and she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law 
a no replied lucy not to mr robert fermi 
— i never saw him in my life 
but asking her eyes upon elinor a to his elder brother what felt elinor at that moment 
astonishnsem 
sense and sensibility 
129 that would have been as full as it was strong had not an immediate dislike of the assertion attended it 
she turned towards lucy in silent amazement unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration 
and though her complexion varied she stood arm in incredulity and felt in no danger of an hysterical at or a son 
you may well be surprised a continued lucy 
a for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before 
for i dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family 
because it was always meant to be a great secret and i am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour 
not a soul of all my relations know of it but anne and i never should have mentioned it to you if i had not felt the greatest de dance in the world upon your senses 
and i maliyelhou but my behaviour in asking so many questions about nih ferraro must seem so odd that it ought to be explained 
and i do not think mr f errara can be displeased when he knows i have trusted you because i know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family and looks upon yourself and the other miss dashwood quite as his own scanty 
she used 
paelinor for a few moments remained silent 
her astonishment at what she heard was at first too great for words 
but at length forcing herself to speak and to speak cautiously she said with a calmness of manner which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude 
a may i ask if your engagement is of long standing 
a 
we have been engaged these four years 
a four years 
7 a cup elinor though greatly shocked still felt unable to believe it 
i. i its sense and sensldllﬂ'y 
i did not know lid she that you were ever acquainted till the other day 
a our acquaintance however it of many years date 
he war under my uncle care you know a confidence while a your uncle 
7 a yes 
mr pratt 
did you never hear him talk of mr pratt 
i think i have a lied elinor with an exertion of spirit which here with her incapable of emotion 
she was four year with my uncle who lives at longataple near plymouth 
it was there our acquaintance begun for m time and me was often saying with my uncle an it was there our engagement wan formed though not till a year after he had quitted ii a gupil 
but he was almost always with or afterwardl 
was very unwilling to enter into it at you may imagine without the knowledge and approbation of his mother 
but i win too young and loved him too well to be no prudent at i ought to have hem 
though you do not know him to well a. me mine dashwood you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he ll very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him 
certainly a answered elinor without knowing what the rapid 
but after a moment's reflection she added with revived security of edwil‘d’l honour and love and her companion falsehood 
e engaged to mr edward ferraro l 
i confer myself to totally surprised at what you tell me that really 
i beg our pardon 
but sure there must be some mistake of person or name 
we can not mean the name mr fen-nu.” we can mean no other a cried lucy uniling 
mr edward ferraro the eldest son of me fear of park-street and brother of your sister-in-law mr john dashwood is the person i mean 
you must allow sens 
and sensibility 
13 
thatlunnotlikel whe deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depended it is strange replied elinor in a most painful perplexity that i should never have heard him even mention your name 
a no 
considering our situation it was not strange 
our first care has been to keep the matter secret 
— you knew nothing of me or my family and therefore there could he no vermin for ever mention my name to you 
and as he was all particularly rid of his 
sister suspecting anything but was reason enough for his not mentioning it she was silent 
— elinor s security sunk 
but her self-command did not sink with it 
a four years you have been engaged 3 said she with a firm voice 
a yes 
and heaven know how much longer we may have to wait 
poor edward 
it puts him uite out of heart then taking a small miniature from her pocket the added to prevent the possibility of mistake he so good as to look at this face 
it does not do him justice to he mii'l but yet i think you can not be deceived as to the person it was drew for 
i have had it above these three years she put it into her hands as she spoke and when elinor saw the aiming whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty eciaion or her wish of detection falsehood might sullen to linger in her mind she could have none of its being edward s face 
she returned it almost instantly acknowledge the likeness 
i have never been able ’ continued lucy to give him my picture in return which i am very much vexed at for he has been always so anxious to get it but i am determined to sit for it the very nt portunity.” 5 on are quite in the right a replied elinor calmly 
12 sense and shisibiuty 
they then proceeded a few pace in silence 
lucy spoke first 
e 
i am sure a said the i have no doubt in the world of your faithﬁzlly keeping thin secret became you must know of what importance it ll to us not to have it reach lili mother 
for she would never a very of it i dare say 
i shall have no fortune 
and i fancy she is an exceeding proud woman is certainly did not seek your conscience 7 aid elinor 
a but you do me no more than justice in imagining that i may be depended on 
your seem in safe with me 
but pardon me if i express some surprise at so unnecemry a communication 
you must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to in safety 
as the said this she looked earnestly at lucy hoping to discover something in her countenance 
perhaps the fuluhood of the greatest part of what she had been saying 
but lucy s countenance suffered no change 
a i was afraid you would think i wan taking a great liberty with you aid she in telling you all thin 
i have not known you long to be sure really at lent but i have known you and all your again by dncrip 
ties a great while 
and as won as i saw or i felt almost an if you wan an old acquaintance 
guide 
in the present case i really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about edward’s mother 
and i am so unfortunate that i have not a creature whose advice i can ask 
anne in the only person that know of it and she he no judgment at all 
indeed she does me a great deal more hannthao good for i am in constant fear of her betraying me 
she does not know how to hold her tongue at you must perceive 
and i am here i was in the greatest fright in the world t other day when edward’s name was mentioned by sir john lest she should out with it all 
you sure nun sensibility 
133 can think how much i go through in my mind from it altogether 
i only wonder that i am alive after what i have altered or edward’s sake these last four years 
everything in such suspense and uncertainty and seeing him so seldom 
we can hardly meet above twice u-ycar 
i am sure i wonder my heart is not quite broke 
here she took out her handkerchief 
but elinor did not feel very compassionate 
a sometimes a continued lucy after wiping her eyes a i think whether it would not better for us both to break of 
the matter entirely as she said this she looked directly at her companion 
but then at other times i have not resolution enough for it 
i can not bear the thoughts of making him so miserable as i know the very mention of such a thing would do 
and on my own account too 
so dear as he is to me 
i doubt think i could be equal to it 
what would gain advise me to do in such a case miss dashwood 
but would you do ourselves 
7 a pardon me rep died elinor startled by the question 
a but i can give you no advice under such circumstances 
your own judgment must direct you 
a to be sure continued lucy after a cup minutes' silence on both sides 9 his mother must provide for him some time or other 
but poor edward it so cast down about it 
did not you think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at barton 
he was so miserable when he left us at longstnble to go to you that i was afraid you would think him quite all 
did he come from your uncle then when he visited us 2 7 a oh yes 
he had been staying a fortnight with us 
did you think he came directly from town e no a replied elinor most feeling sensible of every fresh circumstance in favour of lucy’s veracity 
12 sense and sensiiiilitv 
i remember he told us that he had been staying a fortnight with some friend near plymouth she remembered too her own surprise at the time at his mentioning nothing further of the friend 
at his total silence with respect even to their names 
did not you think him sadly out of spirits 
repeated lucy 
we did indeed particularly so when he lint arrived 
a i begged him to exert himself for fear you should an t what were the matter 
but it made him no me anclroly not being able to may more than a fourth night with us and seeing me to much affected 
poor fellow 
— i am afraid it is just the some with him now 
for he writes in wretched a trial 
i heard from him just before i the exeter 
taking letter from her pocket and camlcldy showing the direction to elinor 
a you know his hand i dare say a charming one it in 
but that in not written so well as usual 
he was tired i dare say for he had just called the sheet to me as full as possible 
elinor saw that it war his hand and oh could doubt no longer 
the picture the had allowed herself to believe might have been accidentally obtained 
it might not have been edward s gift 
but a correspondence between them by letter could iublilt only under a positive engagement could be authorised by nothing else 
for a few moments the was almost overcome 
her heart sunk within her and she could hardly stand 
but exertion was indispensably necessary and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings that her success was speedy and for the lime complete 
writing to each other a said lucy returning the letter into her pocket a is the only comfort we have in such long separations 
yet i have one other common sense and szrrsmnnv 
135 in his future 
but poor edward has not even lbw 
if he bath in picture he says he should be easy 
i gave him s cc of my hair set in a ring when he was at long-mph last and that was some comfort to him he said but not equal to a picture 
perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him 
a i did a said elinor with a cot rest of voice under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond anything she had ever felt before 
she was mortified shocked confounded 
fortunately for her they had now reached the cottage and the conversation could be continued no further 
after sitting with them a few minutes the miss steele 
returned to the park and elinor was then at liberty to think and be wretched 
calm a 
however small elinor’s general dependence on lucy’s veracity might be it was impossible for her on serious reflection to mslmct it in the present case where no tent tion could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a what lucy had asserted to be true therefore elinor could not dared not longer doubt 
supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes 
their opportunity of as acquaintance in the house of mr pratt was a foundation or the rest at 
once indisputable and alarming 
and edward’s visit near plymouth his melancholy state of mind his dissatisfaction at his own respects his uncertain behaviour towards herself the intimate knowledge of the miss steele as to norland and their family connexion which had often surmised r 36 sense and sensrnrun’ 
her the picture the letter the ring 
formed altogether such a body of evidence at overcame every fear condemning him unfairly and emblinhed up a fact which no partiality could net aside his ill-treatment of herself 
her resentment of inch behaviour her at having been its dupe for a short time made her feel only for herself 
but other ideas other considerations noon arose 
had edward been intentionally deceiving her 
had he deigned a regard for her which he did not feel 
what his engagement to lucy an engagement of the heart 
no 
whatever it might one have been the could not believe it such at present 
his affection was all her own 
she could not be deceived in that 
her mother liners fanny all had been conscious of his 
regard for her at norland 
it war not an effusion of her own vanity 
he certainly loved her 
what it softness of the heart was thin permission 
how much could it not tempt her to forgive 
he had been blameable him by blameable in remaining at norland after he first elt her influence over him to be more than it ought to be 
in that he could not lat-defended 
but if he had injured her how much more had he injured himself 
if her case were pitiahle his war hopelen 
his imprudence had made her miserable for while 
but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being otherwise 
she might in time regain tranuility 
at in what had he to look forward to 
could he ever be tolerably ha by with lucy steele 
could he were his affection for herself out of the question with his integrity he delicate and well-informed mind be satisfied with a wife like her 
illiteratt artful and selfish 
the youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to everything but her beauty and good nature 
but the four succeeding years 
years which if rationally spent give such improvement to the andersons ’ 
and sensiijihty 
37 standing must have opened his eyes to her defects of education while the me period of time spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty 
if in the en position of his seeking to marry herself his difficulties from his mother had seemed great how much greater were they now likely to be when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connexions and probably inferior in fortune to herself 
these difﬁculties indeed with a heart so alienated from lucy might not press very hard upon his patience 
but melancholy was e state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness could be felt as a relief i as these considerations occurred to her in painful succession she wept for him more than for herself 
supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappy witness and consoled by the belief that edward has done nothing to forfeit her esteem she thought she could even now under the first smart of the heavy blow command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters 
and so well was she able s answer her own expectations that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes no one would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters that elinor was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love and that marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a man of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house 
the necessity of concealing from her mother and marianne what had been entrusted in confidence to her 38 srmsn nun snusnnm-rv 
self though it in her to unoeauing exertion 
was no aggravation of eltnor‘s distress 
on the contrary it was a relief to her so be spared the communication of what would give such alllicﬁon to them and to he saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of edward which would probably bow from the excess of their partial affection for herself and which was more than she felt equal to support 
from their counsel or their conversation she knew she could receive no assistance 
their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress while her self-command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise 
she was stronger alone and her own good sense so well supported her that her calmness was as unshaken her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable as with regrets so poignant and so fresh it was possible for them to be 
much as she had suffered from her first conversation with lucy on the subject she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it and this for more rooms than one 
she wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement re ated again she wanted more clearly to understand wli 
lucy really felt for edward whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him and she particularly wanted to convince say by her readiness to enter on the matter again and her calmness in converting on it that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend which she very much feared her involuntary agitation in their morning discourse must have left at least doubtful 
that lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable 
it was plain that edward had always s spoken highly in her praise not merely from lucy s actions but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance with a secret so confessedly a evidently important 
and even sir john’s joking intelligence must sense and sensibility 
its have had some weight 
but indeed while elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by edward it required no other consideration of robahilitieu to make it natural that lucy should be i our 
and that she was so her very confidence was u‘gmof 
what other reason for the disclosure of the a i could there be but that elinor i but be informed by it of such as superior claims on edward and be sought to avoid him in future 
she had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival’s intentions and while she was warmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed to combat her own affection for edward and to see him as little as possible 
she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince luck that her heart was wounded 
and as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already been told she did not mistnrst her own abilities of going through a repetition of particulars with composure 
but it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could he commanded though lucy was as well disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred 
for the weather was not often ﬁne enough to allow of their joining in a walk where they might most easily separate themselves from the others 
and though they met at least every other evening either at the park or com e and chiefly at the former they could not be suppose to meet for the sake of conversation 
such a thought would never enter either sir john or lady middleton s head and therefore very little leisure was ever given for general chat and none at all for particular discourse 
they met for the sake of eating drinking and laughing together playing at cards or consequences or any other game that was sufficiently nousy 
one or two meetings of this kind had taken place is sense and sensibiijtv 
without aﬂ'ording elinor any chance of engaging lucy in private when sir john called at the cottage one morning to beg in the name of charity that they would all dine with lady middleton that day as he was obliged to attend the club at exeter and the would otherwise be quite alone except her mother and the two mist steele 
elinor who forced a fairer opening for the point she had in view in such a party as thin was likely to be more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well-bred direction of lady middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose immediately accepted the invitation 
margaret with her mother permission was equally complaints and marianne though always unwilling to join any of their parties was persuaded by her mother who could not bear to have her secure herself from any chance of amusement to go likewise 
the young ladies went and lady middleton wan happily preserved from the fruit htful solitude which had threatened her 
the inside it of the meeting wan exactly such as elinor had expected 
it produced not one novelty of thought or expression and nothing could he lets interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing-room to the latter the children accompanied them and while they remained there she was too well convinced of the possibility of en aging lucy’s attention to attempt it 
they quitted it on my with the removal of the tea-things 
the card-table was then placed and elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of sending time for conversation at the park 
they all rose up in preparation for a round game 
a i am glad said lady middleton to lucy you are not going to wish poor little annamaria’a basket this evening 
for i am sure it must hurt your eye 
to work ﬁllagree by candlelight 
and we will make the sense and shsibiuty 
in dear little love some amends for her disappointment tomorrow and then i hope she will not much mind it 
thin hint wan enough 
lucy recollected herself instantly and replied a indeed you are very much mistaken lady middleton 
i am only waiting to know whether you can make our party without me or i should have been at my ﬁllagree already 
i would not disappoint the little angel for all the world 
and if you want me at the card-table now 1 am resolved to wish the basket after sup er.” you are very good 
hope it went hurt your eyes 
will you ring the bell for some working candles 
my poor little girl would be sadly disappointed i know if the basket was not finished to-morrow for though i told her it certainly would not i am sure she depend 
upon having it done lucy directly drew her workvtahle near her and resented herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could mr no greater delight than in making a lillngree basket for a spoiled child 
lady middleton proposed a rubber of ceasing to the others 
no one made any objection but marianne who with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility exclaimed a your lady will have the goodness to excuse nit 
you know i erect cards 
i shall go to the pianoforte 
i have not touched it since it was turned and without farther ceremony she turned away and walked to the instrument 
lady middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that 11 had never made so rude a he 
a marianne can never keep long worn that intreat you know madam a said elinor endeavouring to smooth away the offence 
and i do not much wonder at it for it is the very beet-toned pianoforte i ever heard the remaining ever were now to draw their pardon 
a perhaps a continued elinor if i should happen in sense and msxnm‘nr

i should like the work exceedingly if she would allow me a share in it a indeed i shall be very much obliged to you for your help a cried lucy for i and there in more to be done to it than i thought there viii 
and it would s a shocking thing to disappoint dear maria after l.” 
a oh 
that would be terrible indeed a said miss steele 
a dear little soul how i do love her 
a you are very kind aid lady middleton w elinor 
a and a you really like the work 
perhaps you will be a well pleased no to cut in till another rubber or will you take your chance now i elinor joyfull passed by the rest of these pools and time by a little of that address which anne could never condescend to mine gained her own end and pleased lady mid eton at the name tirne 
lucy made room for her with nearly attention and the two fair rival were than suited side by side at the same table and with the utmost harmony engaged in forward in the name work 
the pianoforte at which marianne wrapt up in her own music and her own thoughts 
had by thin time forgotten that anybody was in the room besides herself was luckily it near them that miss dashwood now judged she might safely under the shelter of in noise introduce the interesting object 
without any risk of being heard at the card-table 
sense aid sensibiij'i‘y 
in prison 5” 
no a form though cautious tone elinor thus began a i should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with if i felt no desire for its continuance or no farther curiosi on its subject i will not apologise therefore for ringing it forward again ’ thank you a cried lucy warmly for resuming the ice 
you have set my heart at ease by it 
for i was somehow or other afraid i had offended you by what i told us that monday 
a faded me 
how could you suppose so 
believe me a and elinor spoke it widi the truest sincerity 
a nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea 
could you have a motive for the trust that was not honourable and flattering to me 
7 a and yet i do assure you replied lucy her little sha eyes full of meaning there seemed to me to be a cot dress and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable 
i felt sure that you was angry with me 
and have been quarrelling with myself ever since for having work such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs 
but i am very glad to and it was only my own fancy and that you do not really blame me 
i you knew what a consolation it was no me to relieve my heart by speaking to you of what i am always thinking of every moment of my life your compassion would make you overlook everything else i am sure 
a indeed i can easily believe that it was i very great relief to you to acknowledge your situation to me and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it 
your case in a very unfortunate one 
you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties and you will have 24 sense and seisibili‘i'y 
need of all your mutual aﬁ'ecu'on to support you under them

it would be made to marry upon that though for my own part i could give up eveuraye‘prospect of more without a sigh 
i have been always to a very anal income and could struggle with any very for him 
but i love him well m be the eyes ah mean of robbing him perhaps 
of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her 
we must wait it may be for many years 
with almost every other man in the world it would be an alarming prospect 
but edward'aﬁ'ection and constancy nothing can deprive me of i know 
a that conviction must be everything to you 
and he is undoubtedly supported by the am trust in your 
if the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed as between many people and under many cimummoee it naturally wou d during a four years engagement 
your situation would have been pitiable indeed 
lucy here looked up 
but elinor wan careful in guarding her countenance from every expectation that could give her word a judicious tendency 
“edward’s love for me laid lucy “but been pretty well put to the test by our long very long absence since we were in engaged and it has good the trial in well that i ihould be unpardonable to doubt it now 
i can safely say that he has never gave me one moment alarm on that account from the mrs. elinor hardly knew whether to smile or might at thiassertion 
lucy went on 
a i am rather of a turn too by nature and from our different situations in life 
from his being to much more in the world than me and our continual separation i was enough inclined for musens 
and sensibility 
if person to have found out the truth in an instant if there been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met or any lowness of spirits that i could not account for or if he had talked more of one lad than another or seemed in any respect lest happy at ongstaplethanheuledtobe 
idonotmeantoaaythatl am particularly observant or quick-nigth in general but in inch 3 case i am cure i could not be deceived 
a all this a thought elinor in very pretty 
but it can impose upon neither of us a but what a said she after a short silence are our views 
or have you none but that of waiting for sir f mars’ death which is a melancholy and checking extremity 
in her son determined to submit to this and to s the tediousness of the many years of sense in which it may involve on rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while c by owning the truth 
a if we could be certain that it would he only for a while 
but mrs ferraro is a very headstrong proud woman and in her first it of anger upon hearing it would very likely secure everything to robert 
and the idea of that for edward’s sake frighten away all my inclination for hasty measures.” 
and for your own take too or you are carrying your dilintereatednest beyond reason lucy looked at elinor a in and was silent 
do you know mr s it ferraro 7 a asked elinor 
not at all 
1 never saw him 
but i fancy he is unlike his brother 
silly and a great coxeom 2 7 a great coxcombl 1 repeated miss steele whose ear had caught those words by a sudden pause in marianne’s music 
a oh 
they are talking of their favourite heart i dare say 
no litter a cried lucy a you are mistaken there our favourite heaux are not get coxoom 
a i can answer for it that miaduhwood’a in not a i d 3 6 sense and sensiiiiijtv 
laid on jennings laughing heartily 
a her be is one of the modern prettiest-behaved young men i ever law 
but as for lucy she ll such a sly little creature there in no finding out who die like a oh 
a cried miss steele looking significantly round at them i dare nay lucy'l beau is quite a modest and pretty-behaved an miu dashwood’o.” elinor blushed in spite of herself 
lucy hit her lip and looked angrily at her time 
a mutual silence took place for some time 
lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone though marianne was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magniﬁcent concerto 
i will honestly tell on of one scheme which hat lately come into my head for bringing matter to bear 
indeed i am bound to let you into the acre for you are a party concerned 
i dare say you have seen enough of edward to know that he would refer the church to every other professions 
now my put an in that he should take orders as noon at he can and then through your interest which i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him and i hope out of come regard to me your brother i but be pleased to give him norland living 
which gl understand it a very good one and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while 
that would be enough for us to marry upon 7 and we might trust to time and chance for the rest i should be always happy a lied elinor to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for mr ferrm 
but do not a perceive that my interest on such an occasion woull‘l0 be perfectly unneoeuary.’ he in brother to mrs john dashwood 
that must be recommendation enough to her husband 
a but mr john dashwood would not much approve of edward’s going into orden 
sense and sensibility 
it than i rather suspect that my interest would do v little.” hey were again silent for many minutes 
at length lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh 
a i believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dispelling the engagement 
we seem so best with difficulties on every side that though it would make us miserable for a time we should be happier perhaps in the end 
but you will not give me your advice miss dashwood 
no a answered elinor with a smile which concealed very agitated feelings on such a subject i certainly will not 
you know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you unless it were on the side of your wishes 
indeed you wrong me a replied lucy with great solemnity 
i know nobody of whose judgment i think so highly as i do of yours 
and do really believe that if you was to say to me a i advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with edward terms it will be more for the happiness of both of you 5 i should resolve upon doing it immediately 
elinor blushed for the insincerity of edward’s future wife and me i a this compliment would ell'ectually fri hates me rorn giving any opinion on the subject had i owed one 
it raises my influence much too high 
the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for in indikemnt person 
t is because you are an indifferent person said lucy with some pique and laying a particular are on those words a that your judgment might just 
have arch weight with me 
if you could he so to be passed in on me in your own feeling s son would not beywo‘rlihmhazing.” 3 you up 
elinor thought it wisest to make no answer in this ran son and smsrmrrv 
less they might provoke as other to an amiable incmnofemandmraemendwuevenpnrtly determined never to mention the again 
another pause therefore 
of many minutes duration incoeeded thin speech-rid lucywae itilltheﬁrlttnendit 
a shall you he in town this winter mine dashwood 
a said she with all her accummary complacency 
certainly not 
a i am carry for that returned the other while her eye brightened at the infatuation 
it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there 
but i dare nay you will go for all that 
to be one your brother and litter will all you to come to them 
a it will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do 
how unlucky that in 
i had quite depended upon meeting you there 
anne and me are to go the latter and of january to tame relations who have been wanting us to visit them that equal an 
but i only go for the sake of seeing was he will be there in february 
otherwise london would have no charms me i have not spirit for it elinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the list rubber and the confidential discourse of the two ladies wan therefore at an end 
to which both of them tubmitted without any reluctance for nothing had been said on either title to make them like each other less than they had done before 
and elinor not down to the card-table with the melancholy emotion that edward was not only without affection for the person who was to he his wife but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy v in marriage which sincere affection on m tide would have given for lelfinterelt alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement of which the seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary 
sense and sensibility 
-5 from this time the subject was never revived by elinor 
and when entered on by lucy who seldom missed an open purity of introducing it and was particularly care us to inform her confidante of her ha inese whenever she received a letter from end it was treated by the former with calmness and caution and dismissed as soon as civility would allow 
for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which lucy did not deserve and which were dangerous to herself 
the visit of the miss steele at barton park was lengthened far beyond what the sum invitation implied 
their favour increased they could not be spared 
sir john would not hear of their going 
and in to of their numerous and long-arranged engagements in exeter in it of the absolute necessity of their returning to fulfil them immediately which was in full force at the end of every week they were prevailed on to stay nearly two months at the park and to assist in the due celebration of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private balls and large dinner to proclaim its importance 
chapter 5 
though mrs jennings was in the habit of spending a large notion of the year at the houses of her child dress and friends she was not without a settled habitation of her own 
since the death of her husband who had treated with success in a less elegant part of the town she had resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near portmanuare 
towards this home she began on the approach of january to turn her thoughts and thither she one day abruptly and very unexpectedly by them marked the its sense and sensibxlxtv 
elder miss dashwood to accompany her 
elinor without observing the varying complexion of her litter and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the lane immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for this in which she believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations 
the roman allodged was their determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of year 
mr jennings received the refusal with some so l'lllc and repeated her invitation immediately 
so odd 
i am sure your mother can spare you very well and i do beg you will favour me with your company for five quite set 
my heart upon it 
don't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me for i sha n't put myself at all out 
of my way for you 
it will only be uendmgrbetty by the coach and i hope i an ail'ord lbar 
e three shall be able to go very well in my chaise 
and when we are in town if you do not like to go wherever i do well and good you may always go with one of my draw her 
i am sure your mother will not object to it 
or i have had such good luck in getting my own children of 
my hands that the will think me a very lit pen to have the charge of you and if i do n't get one of you at lean well married before i have done with you it shall not be my fault 
i shall speak a good word for you to all the young men you may depend a no it 
i have a notion ’ laid sir john that miss marianne would not object to such a scheme if her elder sister would come into it 
it in very hard indeed that 
she should not have a little pleasure became in dashwood does not 
wish it 
so i would advise you two to set of for town when on are tired of barton without saying a word to miauhwood about it 
a nay cried mr jennings i am sure i shall be monstrous glad of miss marianne s company whether miss dashwood will go or not only the more dusuns an d sensibility 
i s i merrier say i and i thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together 
because if they got tired of me they might talk to one another and laugh at my odd ways mind my back 
but one or the other if not both of them i must have 
lord bless me how do you think i can live poking by myself i who have been always used till this winter to have charlotte with me 
come miss marianne let us strike lands upon the bargain and if miss dashwood will change her mind by-and~bye why so much the better 
i thank you ma'am sincerely thank you said marianne with warmth 
a our invitation has assured my gratitude for ever an it would give me such ha pmess 
yes almost the greatest happiness i am capab c of to be able to accept it 
but my mother my dearest kindest mother 
— i feel the justice of what elinor has urged and if she were to be made less happy less comfortable by our absence 
oh l no not my should tempt me to leave her 
it should not must not be a struggle 
mrs jennings repeated her assurance that mr dashwood could spare them perfectly well 
and elinor who now understood her sister and saw to what indifference to almost everything else she was carried by her eagerness to be with illoughby again made no farther direct opposition to the plan and merely referred it to her mother decision from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to vent a visit which she could d not approve of for anne and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid 
whatever marianne was desirous of her mother would be eager to promote 
she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an air respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust and she dared not sex in the motive of her own disinclination for going to london

m 53 said elinor 
you have been obviating every impediment to the present schemes which occurred to you there in all one objection which in my opinion can not be to us remov 
billarianne s countenance lunk 
a and what a said mrs dashwood in my dear pmdent elinor going to suggest 
what fomiidable obstacle in she now to bring forward 
do not let me hear a word about the expense of it a my objection is thin though i think very well of mr jenningn’ heart she in not a woman who can afford a pleasure or whole protection will give in con uence.’ 
hat in very true a replied her mother 
but of her society separately from that of other people you will scarcely have anything at all and on will almost always appear in public with lady i elton a if e nor in frightened away by her dislike of mr jennings 3 said marianne at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation 
i have no inch temples and i am sure i could us up with every unpleasant of that kind with very little eﬁ'on 
elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manner of a person to whom oh 
had often had difficulty in persuading marianne to behave with tolerable politeness and resolved within herself 
that if her sister perceived in going she would go likewise a 
she did not think it proper that marianne should be left the sole guidance of her own judgment or that mrs jennings a should be pardoned to the mercy of marianne for all the comfort of her domedc home 
to this determination the was the more 93in reconciled by recollecting that edward f errand by lucy’s account 
was not to be in town before february and that their visit without any unrenlonable abridgmcm might be previously ﬁniahed 
12 sense and slnslblllty 
i will have you my go a i mrs dashwood 
a these objections are nonsensical 
you will have much pleasure in being in london and especially in being together 
and if elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment she would foresee it there from a variety of sources 
she would perhaps expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister-in-law s family 
elinor had often wished for an opposite of attempting to weaken her mother dependence on the attachment of edward and herself that the shock might be the less when the whole smith were revealed and now on this attack though almost hopeless of success she forced herself to begin her design by saying as calmly as she could i like edward fears very much and shall always be glad to see him 
but as to the rest of the family it is a matter of fact indifference to me whether i am ever known to t e or not mrs. dashwood smiled and said nothing 
marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment and elinor conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue after very little farther discourse it was finally settled that the invitation should be fully accepted 
mrs jennings received the information with a great deal of joy and many assurances of kindness and care 
nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her 
sir john was delighted 
for to a man whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of being alone the acquisition of two to the number of inhabitants in london was something 
even lady middleton took the trouble of being delighted which was putting herself rather out of her way 
and as for the miss steele especially lucy they had never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence made them 
elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected to feel 
with regard to herself it was now a sense and sensibility 
s 5 matter of unconcem whether she went to town or not 
and when due saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan and her sister exhilarated by it in look voice an manner restored to all her usual animation and elevated to more than her usual gaiety the could not be dissatisfied with the cause and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence 
marianne’s joy was almost a degree beyond happiness no great was the perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone 
her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness 
and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive 
her mother affection was hardly less and elinor was the only one of the three who seemed to consider the separation as anything short of eternal 
their departure took place in the first week in january 
the middleton were to follow in about a week 
the miss steele kept their station at the park and were to quit it only with the rest of the family 
better she 
t 8 elinor could not and herself in the carriage with mrs jennings and beginning a oumeyto ondon under her protection and as her guest without wondering at her own situation so short had their acquaintance with that lady been 
so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition and so many had been her objections against such a measure only a few days before i but these objections had all with that ha know of youth which arisen and her mother quite 
shared been overcome or overlooked 
and elinor in spite of every occasional doubt of will hby’s constancy could not witness the rapture of delightful exr 56 us all ssnsraltrrv 
penetration which called the whole soul and bonnet in the eyes marianne without feeling how blank was her own prospect how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of marianne’s situation to have the lame animating object in view the use possibility of hope 
a short a very than time however must now deade what willoughhy’s intentions were in all probability he was already in town 
marianne’s eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there 
and elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every 
new light as to his character which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention as to ascertain what he was and what he meant before many meetings had taken place 
should the result of her observations he unfavourable she was determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister 
should it be otherwise her exertions would he of a different nature 
she must then learn to avoid every selﬁsh comparison and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of marianne 
they were three days on their journey and marianne’s behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what her future complaints and companionableness to mrs jennings might be expected to be 
she sat in silence almost all the way wrapt in her own meditations and scarcely ever voluntarily speaking except when any object of picturesque beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively addressed to her sister 
to atone for this conduct 
therefore elinor took immediate possession of the of civility which she had assured herself behaved with the greatest attention to mrs jennings talked with her laughed with her and listened to her whenever she could 
and mrs jennings on her side treated them both sense and sensibility 
15 with all possible kindness was solicitous on every son for their ease and enjoyment and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their own dinners at the inn nor extort a confession of their preferring almost to cold or boiled fowls to veal cutlets 
reached town by three o'clock the third day glad to be released after such a journey from the confinement of 
carriage and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good re 
the house wan handsome and handsomely fitted up and the young ladies were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment 
it had formerly been charlotte and over the mantelpiece still hung a landscape in coloured talks of her performance in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect 
as dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their arrival elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her mother and sat down for that purpose 
in a few moments marianne did the same 
i am writing home marianne a said elinor 
had not you better defer your letter for a day or two 21 a i am not going to write to my mother a replied marianne hastily and as if wishing to avoid an farther inquiry 
elinor said no more 
it immediately pack her that she must then be writing to willoughby and the conclusion which as instantly followed was that however mysteriously they might wild to conduct the affair they must be engaged 
this conviction though not entire y satisfactory gave her pleasure and she continued her letter with greater alacrity 
marisnne’s was finished in a very few minutes 
in length it could be no more than a note it was then folded up sealed and directed with eager widity 
elinor thought she could distinguish a large in the direction and no sooner was it complete then marianne ringing the bell 
re158 sense and sbnslblllty 
quitted the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed for her to the twpenny post 
this decided the matter at once 
her spirits still continued very high but there was a matter in them which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister and this agitation increased as the evening drew on 
she could scarcely eat any dinner and when they afterwards returned to the drawing-room seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage 
it was a great satisfaction to elinor that mrs jennings by being much engaged in her own room could see little of what was passing 
the ten things were brought in and already had marianne been disappointed more than once by a is at a neighbouring door when a loud one was sudden yet heard which could out be mistaken for one at an other house 
elinor felt secure of its announcing illoughby s approach and marianne starting up moved towards the door 
everything was silent 
this could not be borne many seconds she opened the door advanced a few steps towards the stairs and after listening half a minute returned into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce 
in the excess of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming to elinor it is willoughby indeed it is 
a and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms when colonel brandon a red 
it was too great a shock to be borne wixteaoslmness and she immediately left the room 
elinor was disa pointed too 
but at the same time her regard for colonel brandon insured his welcome with her and she felt rtieularly hurt that a man partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him 
she instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him that he even observed sens 
and sensibility 
159 marianne so she quitted the room with such punishment and concern as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself 
is your sister ill 
a said he 
elinor answer in some distress that she was end then talked of head-aches low-spiritn and over-fatigues 
and of everything to which she could presently attribute her sister s behaviour 
he heard her with the most earnest mention but seeming to recollect himself said no more on the subject and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in london making the usual in spirits about their journey and the friends they had left he mind 
in this calm kind of way with very little intent on either side they continued to talk both of them out of s merits and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere 
nor wished very much to ask whether willoughby were then in town but she was afraid of giving him by any inquiry after his rival 
and at length by way of saying something she asked if he had been in london ever since she had seen him last 
yes a he re lined with some embarrassment a almost ever since 
i have been once or twice at delaford for a few days but it has never been in my power to return to barton 
this and the manner in which it was said immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place with the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to mrs. jennings and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt 
mrs jennings soon came in 
to colonel 
said she with her usual noisy cheerfulness a i am monstrous glad to see you 
sorry i could not come before 
beg yougardon but 
i have been forced to look about me s i e and settle my matters 
for it is a long while since i have been at home and-you know one has always 6 sense arm sustain-n 
a world of little odd thing 
to do after one been away for any time 
and then i have had cartwright to settle with 
lord i have been at lruly a a be ever since dinner 
but pm colonel how came you to conjecture out that i should be in town lo-da 2 i had the pleasure of hearing it at r. palmer’s where i have been dining “oh 
you did 
well and how do they all do at their home 
how does charlotte do 
i warrant you she it a one seized by thin time 
a mrs. palmer appeared quite well and x urn commiuioned to tell you that you will certainly see her tomarrow.” a ay to be sure i thought much 
well colonel i have brought two young ladies with me you dog 
ill it you see but one of them now but there in another nomewhere 
your friend in marianne too 
which you will not he son 
yet to hear 
i do not know what you and mr. willoughby will do between you about her

marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks 
the disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the expectation of what wan to he that day 
they had not long finished their he before mrs palmer’s borouche stopped the door and in a few minutes she came laughing into the room 
to delighted to see them all that it was hard to any whether she received most pleasure from meeting her mother or the miss duhwoods again 
so surprised at their coming to town though it was what she had rather expected along 
so angry at their accepting her mother invitation after having declined her own though it the same time she would never have forgiven them if they had not come

a after an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat or in other words in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on in jennings’s side and in laughter without came on my palmer’e it was proposed by the latter that they should i all accompany her to some shops where she had busineuthnt coming to which my jennings and elinor readily connected as having likewise some purchases to make them-elm 
and a name though declining it at first was induced to go likewise 
wherever they went she won evidently easy on the watch 
in bond-street especially where much of their business lay her eyes were in constant inquiry 
and in whatever shop the party were engaged her mind w equally extracted from everything actually before them from all that interested and occupied the other

who was wild to buy all could determine on none and duwdkd away her time in raptures and indecision 
it was late in the morning before they returned home 
and no sooner had they entered the house than marianne ﬂew eagerly upstairs and when elinor followed the found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance which declared that no willoughby had been there 
a has no letter been left here for me since we went out 9 3 said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels 
she was answered in the negative 
a are you quite sure of it 2 she replied 
are you certain that no season no partner has eat any letter or note 9 the man replied that none had

a how odd indeed

a if she had not known him to he in town she would not have written to him as she did 
she would have written to cornbe magus 
and if he is in town how odd that he should neither come nor write 
of my dear mother you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter to young a man so little known to he carried on in so doubtful so mysterious a manner 
i long to inquire 
but how will my interference be home 
a she determined after some consideration that if appearances continued many days longer an unpleasant as they now were the would prevent in the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some serious inquiry into the affair

and therefore wan not more indisposed for monument abroad than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence 
elinor found when the evening me over that diepoaiu'on in not materially altered lay a change of abode 
for although narcer settled in town sir john had contrived to collect around him nearly twenty young less and to amuse them with a ball 
this won an r however of which lady middleton did not approve 
in the country an unpremeditated dance was very allowable 
but in london 
where the reputation of elegance was more important and less canin obtained it was walking too much for the gratification of a few girls to have it known that lady middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple with two violina and a mere iidehoard collation 
mr and mrs palmer were of the pity 
from the former whom they had not seen be me since their arrival in town an be was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law and therefore never came near her they received no mark of recognition on their entrance 
he looked at them vlightl without seeming to know who they were and merely nodded to mrs jennings from the other side of the room 
marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered 
it was enough be was not there 
and the at down equally ill-dilpoaed to receive or communicate pleuure 
after they had been anemhled about an hour mr palmer altered towards the miss dashwood to express his inn-price on seeing them in town though colonel brandon had been at informed of their arrival at his home and he had himself aid something very droll on hearing that they were to cry

she complained of it a they returned to herself feet 
a ay 
ay a said hire jennings 1 we know the moon of all that very well 
if a certain son who shall be nameless had been there you wo not have been a bit tired 
and to lay the truth was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited

a cried marianne 
so my daughter middleton told me for it seems sir john met him somewhere in the street thin morning 
marianne said no more but looked exceedingly hurt 
impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead to her lines relief elinor resolved to write the next morning to her mother and hoped by weakening her fear for the health of marianne to procure those inquiries which had been to long delayed 
and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after hreakﬁwl on the narrow that marianne was again writing to willoughby for the could not expose it to he to any other pens 
but the middle of the day on jennings went out b herself on unite and elinor began her letter directly 
while marianne too readerfor employment too anxious for conversation walked from one window to the other or sat down by the are in melancholy meditation 
elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother relating all that had passed her suspicions willoughby’e incomtanc‘ye urging her by every plea of duty and affection to and from marianne an account of her real situation with respect to him

hazle looked more than usually grave and though ex reusing utiefaetion at finding in dashwood alone i he had somewhat in particular to tell her sat for some time without saying a word

is everything finally settled 
in it impossible to

the real late of things between willoughby and her lines was so little known to herself that in endeavouring to explain it she might be as liable to say too much an too lit 
yet at the was convinced that marianne’s affection for willoughby could leave no hope of colonel brandon’s succeu whatever the event of that affection might be and at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure 
the thought it most prudent and kind after some consideration to any more than she really knew or believed

for willoughby neither came nor wrote 
they were engaged about the end of that time to attend lady middleton to a party from which my jennings was kept away by the inn of her young daughter 
and for this party be wholly diepirited careless of her appearance and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or mind without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure 
she sat by the drawing-room ﬁre after tea till the.ruoment of lady middleton’l an'ival without once stirring from her seat or altering her attitude lost in her own thoughts and sensible of her we presence and when at last they were told that lady middleton waited for them at the door she started as if he had forgotten that my one wan expected 
they arrived in due time at the place of destination 
and as soon as the spring of carriages before them would allow alighted mended the mind heard their names announced from one landing-place to another in an audible voice and entered i room splendidly lit up 10 sense and sensibility 
quite full of company and insufferably hot 
when they had paid their tribute of politeness by eurtneying to the lady of the home they were permitted to mine in the crowd and take their there of the beat and inconvenience to which their arrival must necessarily add 
after one time spent in saying little and doing less lady middleton sat down to captain and a marianne was not in spirit for moving about she and elinor luckily succeeding to chain placed themselves at no great distance from the table 
they had not remained in this manner long before elinor perceived willoughby standing within a few yards of them in earnest conversation with a very fashionable-looking young woman 
she soon caught his eye and he immediately bowed but without attempting to speak to her or to approach marianne though he so d not but see her 
and then continued his discourse with the lame lady 
elinor turned involuntarily to marianne to ice whether it could be unobserved by her 
at that moment ill in led him and her whole countenance glowing wi ridden delight the would have moved toward him instantly had not her sister caught hold of her 
a good heavens

oh 
why do 
he not look at me 
why can not i speak to him 
a pray pray be composed a cried elinor and do not betray what you feel to everybody preeent 
perhaps he ha not observedyou yet 
this however was more than she could believe herself and to be composed at such a. moment was not only beyond the reach of marianne it was beyond her wish 
she sat in an agony of impatience which affected every feature 
at last he turned round again and regarded them both 
the started up and pronouncing his name in a sense 
and msroru'rv 
1 tone of affection held out her bind to him 
he applied and addressing himself rather to elinor than a no as if wishing to avoid her eye and determined not to observe her attitude inquired in a hurried manner after mrs dashwood and asked how long they had been in town 
elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address and was unable to say a word 
but the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed 
her face was crimsoned over and she exclaimed in i voice of the greatest emotion good god s willoughby what is the meaning of this 
have you not received my letters 
will you not shake hands with me 
he could not then avoid it but her touch seemed insult to him and he held her hand only for a moment 
using ill this time he was evidently struggling for composure 
elinor watched his countenance and saw its expression becoming more tranquil 
after a moment's use he spoke with calmness 
a i did myself the honour of calling in berkeley-street last tuesday and very much regretted that i was not fortunate enough to and yourselves and mrs jennings at home 
my card was not lost i hope a but have you not received in notes 
a cried marianne in the wisest anxict 
a one is some mistake i am sure 
some dreadful mistake 
what can he the meaning of it 
tell me willoughby 
for heaven's sake tell me what is the matter 
he made no reply 
his complexion changed and all his embarrassment returned 
but as if on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking he felt the necessity of instant exertion he recovered himself again and after saying a yes i had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town which you were so as to send to me turned hastily sway with a sight how and joined his friend

to wait at least with the appearance of composure

for marianne continued instantly to give way in a low voice to the mine of her feelings by exclamation of wretchedness 
no a short time elinor saw willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase and to in marianne that he was gone urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that evening as a fresh argument for her to be calm 
she instantly begged her sister would entreat lady middleton to take them home as the was too miserable to say a minute longer 
lady middleton though in a middle of a rubber on being informed that marianne wan and was too polite to object for a moment to her will of going away and making over her cards to a friend they departed at noon at the carriage could be found

it was some minutes before the could go on with her letter and the frequent hum of grief which still obliged her at intervals to withhold her pen were proof enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that the was writing for the last time to willoughby 
elinor paid her every quiet and unobtruoive attention in her power 
and she would have tried to soothe and tranquillized her still more had not marianne entreated her with all the eagerness of the most nervously irritability not no speak to her for the world 
in inch circumstances it was better for both that they should not be long together

do you that nothing wo d surprise me more than to hear their being going to be married a for shame for shame miss dashwood how can you talk so 
don’t we all know that it must be a match-that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met

elinor drew near but without saying a word 
and seating herself on the bed took her hand kissed her affectionately several times and then gave way to a burst of tears which at in was scarcely less violent than marianne’s

and though i am quite all loan to discover in what point i could be so unfortunate an to offend you i entreat your forgiveness of what i can assure you to has been perfectly unintentional 
i shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your family in derbyshire without the most pleasure and matter myself it will not be broken any mistake or minappreheneion of my actions 
m esteem for your whole family is very sincere 
but if have been so unfortunate as to give rise to believe more than i felt 
or meant to express i shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded in my professions of that esteem 
that i should ever have meant more you will allow to be impossible when you understand that my actions have been long engaged elsewhere and it will not be men weeks i believe before this engagement is fulﬁlled 
t in with great regret that i obey your commands of returning the letters with which i have been honoured from you and the lock of hair which you so obligingly bestowed on me 
i am dear madam your most obedient humble servant jornr wrtwuarmr 
n. i a or sense and snnsmu-rv 
with what indignation such a letter at thin must be read by miss dubwood may be imagined 
though aware before she began it that it must bring a confession of hit inconstancy and concern their separation for ever the wan not aware that such language could be tendered to announce it 
nor could ill have iii pounds willoughby capable of parting to far from this appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling 
so far from the common decorum of a gentleman s w lend a letter so i udently cruel a letter which instead of bringing with her desire of a release any profusion 
of regret acknowledged no breach of faith denied all alarm affection whatever 
4 letter of which every lid was an insult and which proclaimed in writer to be deep in hardened villany 
she passed over it for some time with indigth mniehment 
then read it again and again but 
every penlnl only serve to increase her abhorrence of the man and it bitter were her feelings against him that she dared not trust herself to speak lent she might wound marianne still deeper b treating their engagement not as a loss to her of any possible good but a an escape from the worst and most memediable of evils a connexion for life with an unprincipled man an a deliverance the most real a blessing the most important 
in her earnest meditation on the contents of the letter on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it and probably on the very different mind of a very decent person who had no other connexion whatever with the fair than what her heart gave him with everything that passed elinor forgot the immediate dream of her sister forgot that she had three letter 
on her lap yet read and an entirely forgot how long the had been in the room that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door the went to the window to see who could be coming to unrcamnnbly early ll was all sense and smsrmu‘rv 
19 atonilhment m pierce my jennings chariot which the knew had not been ordered till one 
determined not to quit marianne though hopeless of contributing at present to her ease the bustle away to excuse herself from attending on jennings on account of her sister being in 
mr jennings with a thoroughly good-humoured concern for same admitted the exact cuee most readily end elinor liter seeing her care off returned to marianne whom he found attempting to rise from the bed and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the door faint and giddy fromalong want of up s rest and food 
for it was many days since the any a polite and many nights since she had really sl 
an now when her mind wan no longer by the fever of expense the consequence of 
thin wan felt in an aching head e weakened stomach and general nervous faintneu 
a glass of wine which elinor procured for her directly made her more comfortable and the week at last able to express come come of her kindness by saying 
— a poor elinor 
how unhappy i make you 
7 a i only wallis a replied her at a there were anything i could do which might be of comfort to you 
shut up everything else would have been my too much for marianne who could only exclaim in the an of her heart a s elinor i am miserable in need before her voice wan entirely lost in love 
elinor could no longer withers thin torment of undefined grief in silence 
a exert yourself dear marianne ill cried wife s would not kill yourself and all who love you 
think of your mother

for her sake you must exert yourself 
i can not i can not cried marianne

a young man not talk so marianne

much an on iuﬁ'er now think of what you would leave off she also of his character had been delayed to a later period 
if your engagement had been carried on or months and month as it might have been before he chose to put an end to it 
every additional day of unhappy confidence on your ride would have made the blow more dreadful a engagement

sometimes s thought it had been 
but it never was sense and sensibility 
ii yet you wrote to him 
yes 
could that bewrong aﬁernll tharhndpaued 
but i can not ask 
elinor said no more and turning again to the three letterwhich now raised such stronger curiosity than before directly ran over the contents of all 
the lines which war what her either had rent his on their arrival in town war to this effect 
bennet sun-r january 
a how i read you will he willoughby on receiving thin

i think you will feel something more than rurpi-ine when you know i am in town 
an opportunity of coming hither though with mr jennings wantemytation weeould nmrelist 
with you receive thin in time to come here fortnight but i s not depend on it 
at any rate i shall expect you was 
for the present ideas 
m. do her second note which hid been written on the morning are the dance at the middletone’ was in there word 
— i can not express my disappointment in having mind you the day before yesterday nor my anoniuhrnent a not having received any answer to a note which eentymuboveaweeli ago 
i have been expecting tohearfrorn you andnillni0ieroaeeycm e hour of the day 
pray call again a soon as ponih e. and explain the reason of my having expecmd thin in vain 
you had better come earlier another ﬁme became we are generally out by one 
we were in no t at lady middleton’s where there was i dance 
have been told the you were aired to be of the pug 
but could it he no 
you inner be very much all indeed since we parted if that could be the case and you not there 
22 sense and sensibility 
but i will not suppose this possible and i hope very 
soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise 
m. d 
the contents of her last note to him were these 
what am i to imagine willoughby by your behaviour last night 
again i demand an explanation of it 
i was prepared to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally produced with the familiarity which our intimacy at barton a so me to justify 
1 was repulsed indeed 
have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse in conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting 
but though i have not yet been able to form an reasonable apology for your behaviour i am perfectly read to hear our justification of it 
you have perhaps miss arranged or purple deceived in something concerning me which may have lowered me in your opinion 
tell me what it is explain the grounds on which you acted and i shall be satisfied in being able to satisfy you 
it would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill of you 
but i am too it if am to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed on that your regard for us all was insincere that your behaviour to me was intended on to deceive let it be sold as soon as possible 
my fee ings are at present in a state of dreadful indecision 
i wish to acquit you but certainty on either side will be ease to what i now suffer 
if your sentiments are no longer what they were you will return my notes and the lock of my hair which is in your possession 
m. d 
that such letters so full of affection and confidence could have been so answered elinor for willoughby’s ake 
would have been unwilling to believe 
but her condemnation of him did not find her to the imprudence and sensibility 
la purity of their having been written at all 
and she was silently grieving over the imprudence which had handed loch muolicited roof of tenderness not wanted by anything preceding and mot severely condemned by the event when marianne perceiving that the had finished the letters observed to her that they contained nothing but what any one would have written in the lame aituntion 
i felt if added to he an eolemnl engaged tohimu themicteet legal covenant had and to each other 
1 can believe it a said elinor 
a but unfortunately he did not feel the name 4 he and feel the lane elinor 
for week and weeks he felt it 
i know he did 
whatever may have changed him now and nothing but the blackest an employed against me can have done it 
1 was once as dear to him a my own soul could with 
this lock of hair which now he can so readily give up was begged‘of me with the most earnest eupplicntion 
had you seen his look his manner had you heard his voice at that moment have you for of the last evening of our being there at barton 
the morning that we parted too 
en he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again-«hie distress 
can i ever to et hil dime-5| a for a moment or two she c d say no more 
but when thin emotion had passed away she added in a firmer tone 
a elinor i have been cruelly used but not by willoughby 
dearest marianne who but himself 
by whom can he have been imtigated 
7 a by all the world rather than by his own heart 
i could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance a league together to ruin me in his opinion than believe his nature capable of such cruelty 
thin woman of 24 sense and sensibility 
whom he writes 
whoever the be 
or any one in short but your own dear of mamma and edward may have been so barbarous to belie me 
beyond in three in there a creature in the world whom would not rather effect of evil than willoughby whole heart i know no we 
elinor would not contend and only replied a whoever may have been to deteltably your enemy let them be cheated of their malignant triumph my dear lines by seeing how nobly the contciauaneae of your own innocence and good intentions upon your rpirita.‘ it in a reasonable and laudable pride which resist such malevalence 
a no no a cried marianne a mine inch as mine ha no pride 
i care not who know that i am wretched 
the triumph of seeing me i may be open to all the world 
lilinor elinor they who suffer little may be proud and and bent on they like 
may mint insult or return mom‘ cation 
but i can not 
must feel 
i must be wretched 
and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that came a but for my mother sake and mine 
7 a i would do more than for my own 
but to appear harry when i am so miserable 
— only who can require it 
7 again they were both silent 
elinor wan employed in walking thoughtfully from the are to the window from the window to the are without knowing that the received warmth from one or discerning objects through the other 
and marianne seated at the foot of the bed with her head leaning against one of it pom again took up willoughby’t letter and after shuddered over every s entrance exclaimed 
— 
it in too much i no willoughby willoughby could thin be yours 
cruel cruel 
nothing can acquit you 
elinor nothing can 
whatever he might have sense and sensibility 
25 heard against nae 
ought he not to have impended his belief 
ought he not to have told profit to have given me the power clearing myeeif 
the lock of hair repeating it from the letter which you it obligingly renewed on me by that in unpardonahle 
willonghby where was your heart when an wrote those words 
oh barbarounly insolcnt l~eliuor can he be united 
7 a no marianne in no possible way a and et thin woman 
who known what her art may have 
how long it my have been premeditated and how deeply contrived by her s 
who in the 
—

whom did i ever hear him talk of an young and attractive among his female acquaintance 
oh 
no one no one 
he talked to me only of myself another uee enlued

i must go and concern

7 a to-momw marianne 
yes why should i stay here 
i came on for willoughhy’ sake 
and now who cares for me 
he regards me i a 
it would be impossible to go tomorrow 
we owe mrs jennings much more than civility 
and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal us that 
well then another day or two perhaps 
but i cannoti my here 10 i can not my to endure the question and remark of these pie 
the middleton 
and palmer 
how am i to z their pity 
the pity of such a woman a lady middleton s 
oh i what would be i to that 
nor advised her to lie down again and for a moment she did so 
but no attitude could give her cure 26 sense and swsruru’rv 
and in restless pain of mind and body the mud from one posture to another till growing more and more hyeteriml her litter could with difficulty keen her on the bed at all and for name time wan fearful of being constrained to call for auittance 
some lavender drops however which the was at length permitted to take were of use 
and from that time till mr leaning 
returned the continued on the bed quiet and motionless 
hum was 
mrs jennings came immediately to their room on her return and without waiting to have her request of admittance answered opened the door and walked in with a look of real concern 
a how do you do m dear 
a said she in a voice of great companion to anne who turned away her face without attem sing to answer 
a how in she in dashwood 
poor thing 
the look very bad 
no wonder 
ay it is but too true 
he ll to be married very noon 
a good-for-nothing fellow 
i have no patience with him 
mr taylor told me of it half an hour ago and the was told it by a particular friend of mist grey herself else i am sure i ihould not have believed it 
and i was almost ready to sink a it wan 
well said i all i can lay in that 
if it is true he has used a young lad of my acquaintance abornimbly ill and i wish with my soul his wife my plague hll heart out 
and so i shall always lay my dear you may depend on it 
i have no notion of men going on in this way 
and if ever i meet him again i will give him such a dressing as he has not had thin many a day 
but there ii one comfort my dear miss marianne 
he in not the only young man in the world sense and sensibility 
27 worth having 
and with your pretty face you will never want admirers 
well poor thing 
i want disturb her my longer for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with it 
the parrys ssndersans luckily are coming to-night you know and that will amuse her 
she then went away walking on i to out of the room as if she so passed her young friends sillictiou could be increased y noise 
v marianne to the rise of her sister determined on diningwith them 
nor even advised her against it 
but a no she would go down s she could bear it very well and the bustle about her would be less elinor pleased to have her governed fora moment by such a motive though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner said no more 
and adjum'n herdress for hera well as she could while marianne remained on the bed was ready to assist her into the dining-room up soon as they were summoned to it 
when there though looking most wretchedly she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected 
had she tried to speak or had she been conscious of half mrs .lennin s s welldneant but ill-judged attentions to her this ufmness could not have been maintained 
but not a syllable escaped her lips and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of everything that as using before her 
e nor who did justice to mrs jennings’s kindness though its effusions were often distressing and sometimes almost ridiculous made her those acknowledgments 
and returned her those civilities 
which her sister could not make or return for herself 
their good friend saw that 
marianne was unhappy and felt that everything was due to her which might make her at all less so 
she treated her therefore with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of its or sense and sensibility 
holidays 
marianne was to have the best place by the lime watto betemptedto eat hyeverydeliucyin the house and to be unused by the relation of all the news of the day 
had not elinor in the sad countenance of her sister seen a check all mirth she could have been entertained by mrs jennings s endeavours to cure 3 disappointment in love 
by s variety of sweet and of ives and a good fires 
as noon however no the consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on marianne she could stay no longer 
with an hasty exclamation of misery an a sign to her sister not to follow her she directly got up and hurried out of the room 
a poor soul l 
cried mr jennings as soon as she was gone a how it grieves me to see her 
and i declare if the is not gone away without ﬁnieliing her wise and the driest cherries too 
lord 
nothing seems to do her any good 
i am sure if i knew of anything she would like i would send all over the town for it 
well it is the oddest thing to me that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill 
but when there is plenty of money on one side and next to none on the other lord bless you 
there no more about such things 1 
6 the lady then 
mist grey i think you called her 
— is very rich 
a fifty thousand pounds my dear 
did you ever see her 
a smart selfish girl the lay but not handsome 
i remember her aunt very well biddy henshawe 
the married a very wealthy man 
but the family are all rich together 
fifty thousand pounds 
and by all accounts it went come before it is wanted 
for they say he is all to pieces 
no wonder 
dashing about with his curricle and human 
well it done at if talking 
but when i young man be he who he will comes and makes love to a pretty girl and promises marriage he has no business to fly off from his word only because sense and sensibility 
29 hegrowt tndariehergiziitretdytohavehirn 
why do t he in and a case tell hit llul’iel let hit house turn of hit tenants and make a thorough reform at once 
i warrant a miss marianne would have been ready to wait till mattercnme round 
but that want do nowadays 
nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age a do you know what kind of t girl miss grey it 
the taidmbeamiahle 
a i never heard any harm of her 
indeed i hardly ever heard her mentioned 
six t that mrs taylor did any that morning that one day its walker hinted to her that the believed mr an mr elliot would not be sorry to have miss grey married for the and mr elliot could never agree 
and who are the elliot 
a her guardians my dear 
but now the it of age and no chose for herself 
and t pretty choice the ill 
model 
what now after pausing moment 
a your poor time has gone to her own room i suppose turn by herself 
in there nothing one can get to comfort her 
poor dear it seem quite cruel to let her be alone 
well by-nnd-by we shall have t few friends and that will nature her a little 
what shall we play at 
she hates whitt i know 
but it there no round the area for 
7 a dear madam this kindness it quite unneeetttry 
marianne i dare lay will not leave her room again diit evening 
i shall persuade her in can to go early to bed for i am sure the want rest 
may i believe that will be beat for her 
let her name her own upper and go to bed 
lord no wonder the but been looking to had in to cut-down than last week or two for this matter i suppose hat been hanging over her head at long at that 
and the letter that came to-day wished it 
poor tonll i 2 sense and sensibility 
imnrr'eifl had hadamﬁmofiglwould not have a red her about it for all my money 
but then you w how should i inch 2 thing 
i rude sure of it being nothing at a common love-letter and you know young people like to he laughed at about them 
lord 
how concerned sir john and my daughter will bewhentheyhearit 
if had had myeenlelabout me i might have called in conduit-street in my way home and told them of it 
but i shall lee them w 
sorrow it would be unnecessary i am run for you to caution on palmer and sir john against ever naming mr willoughby or making the ill htut allusion to what has passed before my sister 
heir own good-nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know anything about it when the in recent 
and the led that may ever be maid to m eyes on the subjects the more my feelings will be park at you my dear madam will easily believe to lord yes that i do indeed 
it must be terrible for you to hear it talked of 
and a for your litter i am sure i would not mention a word about it to her for the world 
you law i did not all dinner-time 
no more would sir john nor my daughter for there are all very thoughtful and considerate 
«pecth if give them a hint a i certainly will 
f or my part i think the let 
that in mind about such thing the better the sooner ’tia blown over and forgot 
and what good does talking ever do you know 
2 in thin affair it an only do harm 
-rnore no perhaps than in many case of a similar kind for it been attended by circle which for the take of every one concerned in it make it not to become the public convenation

found at the expected in her own room leaning in silent misery over the mail routine of a are which till elinor’s entrance had been hardly right 
you had better leave me a we all the notice that her litter received from her 
a i will leave you a said elinor if you will go to bed but this from the momentary pervenenen of impatient suffering the at first round to do 
her letters earnest though gentle 
persuasion however soon offered her to compliance and elinor saw her lay her aching head on the pillow and now her an the hoped in a way to get some quiet at before the left her 
in the drawing-room whither the then repaired the was soon joined by my jennings with wine-glue full of something in her hand 
a my dear laid the entering i have just recollected that i have some of the finest old constantin wine in the home that ever wanted 
so i have brought a glass of it for your litter 
my poor husband how fond he was of it 
whenever he had a touch of hit old cholick gout he laid it did him more good than anything joke in the world 
do take it to your linen dear madam replied elinor smiling at the difference of the company for which it was recommended how good you are

colonel brandon came in while the were at tea and by hit manner of looking round room for marianne elinor immediame fancied that he neither expected nor wished to ice her there and in than that he was already aware of what occasioned her absence 
mrs jennings wet not struck by the tame thought 
for noon after hit entrance the walked croft the room to the temple where elinor presided and whispered 
the colonel look at grave at ever you see 
he knows nothing of it 
do tell him my dear 
he shortly afterwards drew a chair close to here and with a look which perfectly assured her of hit good information enquired after her airs 
a marianne it not well a said the 
a she hat been wanda” andwehavepertuaded hertogom perhaps then he hesitatingly replied that i heard this morning nay he true 
there may be more truth in it than i could believe pot-'hle at in what did you hear

but how shall i tell you

c 24 sense and sensibility 
day of general elucidation for this very morning ﬁrst unfolded it to in 
mr willoughby is unfathomable 
where did you hear it 
2 in a stationer't shop in pass all where i bad business 
two ladies were waiting for their carriage and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match in a voice so little attempting concealment that it was impossible for me not to hear all 
the name of willoughby john willoughby frer‘pently repeated lint caught my attention and what to owed was a positive assertion that everything was now finally settled respecting his marriage with miss c 
it was no longer to be a secret 
it would take r 
face even within a few weeks with many particulars of up on and other matters 
one thing especially 
remember because it served to rectify the man still more 
— as soon as the ceremony was over they were to go to some means his seat in somersetshire 
my astonishment 
but it would be impossible to describe what i felt 
the communicative lady i learnt an enquiry for i staid in the shop till they were gone was a mrs elliot and that as i have been since informed is the name of miss grey guardian.” a it is 
but have you likewise heard that miss grey has fifty thousand pounds in that if in anything we may and an explanation 
a it may be so 
but willoughby is capable 
at least i think 
— he stopped a moment 
then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself a and your sister how did shewn a her sufferings have been very severe 
i have only to hope that they my be proportionally short 
it has been it it a most cruel afﬂiction 
till yesterday i believe she never doubted his regard 
and even now perhaps 
but i am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her 
he has been very deceitful 
sense and mamma 35 and in some points there seems a hardness ofheart about him 
ah i a said colonel brandon a there is indeed 
but your sister does not 
i think you said so 
she does not consider it quite as you do in a you know her disposition and may believe how a sly she would still justify him if she could 
e made no answer 
and soon afterwards by the removal of the tea things and the arrangement of the card the subject was necessarily mrs jennings who had watched them with pleasure while the were talking and who expected to see the effect of miss dashwood’s communication in such an instantaneous gaiety on colonel brandon’s side as might have become a man in the bloom of youth of hope and happiness saw him with amazement remain the whole evening more serious and thoughts than usual 
«eb-9m 5 room i night of more sleep than she had expected f marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had closed her eyes 
elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt 
and before breakfast was ready they had gone through the subject again and again 
with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on elinor side the same impetqu feelings and varying opinions on marianne’s as before 
sometimes she could believe willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself and at others lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him 
at one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all 36 sense and sensibility 
the world it mother she would secure herself from it for ever and at a third could resist it with energy 
in one thing however she was uniform when it come to the point in avoiding where it was possible the presence of mrs jennings and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it 
her heart was hardened against the belief of mrs jennings’s entering into her sorrows with any compassion 
a no no no it can not be a she cried 
she can not feel 
her kindness is not sympathy 
her good-nature is not tenderness 
all that she wants is gossip and she only likes me now because i supply it elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others by the irritable refinements of her own mind and the too great importance placed by her on the delicacy of a strong sensibility and the graces of a polished manner 
like half the rest of the world if more than half there be that are clever and good marianne with excellent abilities and an excellent disposition was neither reasonable nor candid 
she expected from other place the name opinions and feelings as her own and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself 
thus a circumstance occurred while the sisters were together in their own room after bmaltfatt which sunk the heart of mrs jennings still lower in her estimation 
because through her own weakness it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself though mrs jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost good-will 
with a letter in her outstretched hand and countenance gaily smiling from the persuasion of bringing comfort she entered their room saying 
— a now my dear i bring you something that i am sure will do you good 
marianne heard enough 
in one moment her imagsense and srnsxbilh'y 
37 ination placed before her a letter from will buy full of tender and contrition explanatory of a that had latiefactory convincing 
and instantly followed willoughby hrrmelf ruehin eagerly into the room to force at her feet by the offence of hit see the wurancel of his letter 
the work of one moment was employed by the next 
the handwriting of her mother never till then unwelcome wan before her 
and in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an excess of more than one the felt as if till that instant the had never suffered 
the cruelty of mrs jennings no language within her reach in her moment of happiest eloquence could have expressed 
and now the could reproach her only by the tent which screened from her eyes with pauionate violence 
a enough however do entirely lost on its object that s many expression of pity the withdrew etill referring her to the letter for comfort 
but the letter when the was calm enough to read it brown but little comfort 
willoughby called every page 
her mother ntill contents of her engagement and relying a warmly at ever on his constancy had only been roused by elinor’s application to entreaty from nrinnne greater openings toward them both and thin with such tenderness toward her such affection for willoughby and each a conviction of their future happiness in each other that the wept with agony through the whole of it 
all her impatience m be at home again now returned 
her mother wan dearer to her than ever 
dearer through the very excess of her mistaken confidence in willoughby and she was wild urgent to be gone 
elinor unable e herself to determine whether it were better for marianne to be in london or at barton offered no counsel of her own excess of patience till their mother s wieheeeauld could be now 
and at length the obtained her sisters content to wait for that knowledge 
38 sense and sensibility 
mr jennings left them early than not 
for die cmrldnotbeeuytillthemiddletom and palmeriwere able to grieve in much an herself and positively reﬁnaing elinor’s offered attendance went out alone for the rent of the morning 
elinor with a very heavy heart aware of the in the will going to communicate and perceiving by anne's letter how ill the had proceeded in laying any foundation for it then eat down to write her mother an account of what had passed and intreat her direction for the future 
while marianne who came into the drawing-room on my jenninga’l going away remained vexed at the table where elinor wrote watching the advancement of her pen grieving over her for the hardship of inch a task and grieving mill more fondly over its effect on her mother 
in thin manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour when marianne whose never could not then bear any sudden noise war startled by a rap at the door 
a who can think be 
a cried elinor 
a so early too 
i thought we bad been safe marianne moved to the window 
a it is colonel brandon 1 3 said the with vention 
a we are never safe from sir

7 a man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of other 
the event proved her conjecture right though it was founded on injustice and error for colonel brandon did come in 
and elinor who was convinced that solitude for marianne brought him thither and who raw bat solicitude in hit disturbed and melancholy look and in hit anxioue though brief inquiry after her could not forgive her sister for esteerning him an lightly

he stopped 
a i understand you a said elinor 
a you have something to tell me of mr willoughby that will open hit character farther

evening at barton park 
at war the evening of a dance 
in which i alluded to a lady i had once known as assembling in some measure your sister marianne 
and a answered elinor i have not forgotten it he looked pleased by this remembrance and added 
a if i am not deceived by the uncertainty the partiality of tender recollection there is a very mung resemblance between them as well in mind as person the name warmth of heart the same eagerness of fancy and spirits 
thin lady was one of my nearest relations an orphan from her infancy and under the guardianship of my father 
our ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years we were plan how 
and friends 
i can not remember the time when did not love eliza 
and my affection for her as we grew up was arch as perhaps judging from my present forlorn and cheerlegmvityhyou might think me inca be of having ever elt 
area for me was i believe fervent up the attachment of your sister to mr willoughby and it was though from a different cause no less unfortunate 
at seventeen she was lost to me for ever 
she was married 
married against her inclination to my brother 
her fortune wan large and our family estate much encumbered 
and this i fear is all that can be said for the conduct of one who war at once her uncle and guardian 
my brother did not deserve her 
he did not even love her 
i had hoped that her regard for me would so it her under any difficulty and for some time it i 
— but at last the misery of her situation for she experienced great unkindneu overcame all her resolution and though she had raised name that nothing 
but how bingley i relate s have never told you how this war brought on 
we were within a few hours of hoping together for scotland 
the treachery or the folly of my cousin 
maid betrayed us 
i was sense and seusrmu’nv‘ 
or banished to the house of a relation far distant and she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement till my father s point was gained 
i had depended on her fortitude too far and the blow was a severe one 
but had her marriage been happy so young as i then was a few months must have reconciled me to it or at least i should not have new to lament it 
this however was not the one 
my brother had no regard for her his pleasures were not what they ought to have been end from the first he treated her unkindly 
the consequence of this no a mind so young so lively so inexperienced as red brandon s was but too natural 
she herself at first to all the misery of her situation 
and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned 
but can we wonder that with such a husband to provoke inconstancy and without a friend to advise or restrain her for my father lived only s few months after their marriage and i was with m regiment in the east indies she should fall 
had remained in england perhaps 
but l meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years and for that purpose had procured my exchange 
the shock which her marriage had given me a he continued in a voice of great agitation 
was of trifling weight 
— was nothing 
to what i felt when i heard about two years afterwards of her divorce 
it was ibo 
which threw this gloom 
even now the recollection of what i suffered 
he could so no more and rising hastil walked for a few minutes a at the room 
elinor a bed by his relations and still more by his distress could not speak 
he saw her concern and coming to her took her hand pressed it and kissed it with grateful respect 
a few minutes more of talent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure 
ye sense and sensibility 
a it was nearly three year after this unhappy period before i returned to england 
my first care when i did arrive was of course to seek for her 
but the reach wan as fruitless a. it wan melancholy 
i could not trace her beyond her first aeducer and there wan every moon to fear that the had removed from him only to think deeper in a life of sin 
her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance and i learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person 
he imagined and calmly could he imagine it that her extravagance and consequent distress had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief 
at in however and after i had been six months in england i m and her 
regard for a former servant of my own who had since fallen into misfortune carried me to visit him in a apunging-houae where he wan confined for debt 
and there in the same house under a similar conﬁnement was my unfortunate liner 
so altered 
so faded 
whom down by acute suffering of every kind 
hardly could i believe the melancholy and sickly glare before me to be the remain of the lovely blooming healthful girl on whom i had once doated 
what i endured in so beholding her 
but i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it 
i have pained you too much already 
that the was to all appearance in the lame 
stage of a conuumption wan 
yet in such a situation it was my greatest comfort 
life could do nothing for her beyond giving time for a better preparation for death 
and that wan given 
i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings and under proper attendants 
i visited her every day during the rent of her short life was with her in her and moments 
again he stopped to recover himself 
and elinor sense and sensibility 
7 4 he her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern it the fate of his unfortunate friend 
your sister i hope can not be offend 3 said he by the resemblance i have fancied between her and my poor dirgrnced relation 
their faces their fortunes can not be the same 
and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a former mind or a happier marriage she might have been all that you will live to see the other be 
but to what does all this lead 
i seem to have been distressing you for nothing 
ah 
miss dashwood 
a subject such as this 
untouched for fourteen years 
it is dangerous to handle it at all 
i will be more collected 
more concise 
she left to my care her only little child a little girl the offspring of her first guilty connection who was then about three years old 
she loved the child and had always kept it with her 
it was a valued a precious trust to me 
and gladly would i have discharged it in the strictest sense by watching over her education myself had the nature of our situations allowed it 
but i had no family no home 
and my little eliza was therefore placed at school 
i saw her there whenever i could and after the death of my brother which happened about ﬁve years ago and which left me the on of the family my put rays she frequently visited me at delaford 
i called her a distant relation 
but 1 am well aware that i have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her 
it is now three year 
ago she had but reached her fourteenth year that i removed her born school to place her under the care of a very respectable woman residing in dorsetshire who had the charge of four or have other girls of about the same time of life 
and for two years i had every reason to be pleased with her situation 
but last febnrary almost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared 
i had allowed her imprudent a it 44 sims

huainoemmdout athereamertdeeire togoto bath with one of her young friends who wan attending her father there for hit health 
iknewhim to he very good sort of man and 1 than but well of his daughter 
better than she deserved or with a most obstinate and ill-judged iecrecy the would tell nothing would give no clue though the certainly knew all 
he her father 
a well 
meaning but not a quick-lighted man could really i believe give no information 
for he had been generally confined to the home while the girl were hanging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose 
and he tried to convince me a thoroughly 4 he war convinced himself of his daughters being entirely unconcerned in the hardness 
in short i could learn nothing but that the was gone 
all the rent for eight long months wan left to conjecture 
what i thought what i failed may be imagined 
and what i suffered too good heavens cried elinor could it he 
could willoughby 
just the first news that reached me of her a he continued came in a letter from behalf last october 
it was forwarded to me from delaford and i received it on the very morning of our intended party to whiten 
and this war the remain of my leaving barton to ruddenly which i am sure must at the time have alilmml itmngc to everybody and which i believe gave once to name 
little did mr willoughby imagine i suppose when his look censured me for incivility in breaking up the party that i wan called away to the relief of one whom he had made s and miserable 
but ball be known it what wonltlpi’lj have availed 
would he have been essay or less happy in the smiles of your sister 
no he ha already done that which no man who can feel for another would do 
he had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had sense and sensibility 
-5 seduced in a situation of the utmost distress with no creditable home no help no friends ignorant of his address 
he had left her promising to return 
he neither returned nor wrote nor replied her this is beyond everything 
exclaimed elinor 
a his character it now before you 
expensive dissipated and worse than both 
knowing all this at i hen now known it many weeks guess what i must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever and on being assured that the was to marry him 
guess what i must have felt for all your sakes 
when 1 came to you last week and found you alone i came determined to know the truth thou by irresolute what to do when it must known 
my behaviour must have seemed strange to you then 5 but now you will comprehend it 
to suffer you ill to be so deceived 
to see your sister 
but what could i do 
i had no hope of interfering with tuccett 
and sometimes i thought your sister s influence might yet reclaim him 
but now after such dishonounble usage who can tell what were his designs on her 
whatever they may have been however the may now and hereafter doubtless mi” turn with gratitude towards her own condition when she compare it with that of my poor eliza when the considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this r girl and her to herself with in affection or him at strong still at strong as her own and with a mind tormented by self-reproach which must attend her through life 
surely this comparison must have its use with her 
she will feel her own sufferings to be nothing 
they proceed from no misconduct and can bring no disgrace 
on the contrary every friend must be made still more her friend by them 
concern for her unhappiness and respect for her fortitude under it must strengthen every attachment 
use your own discretion however in communicating to her what i have told you 
you must know best what 6 sense and smsrsrurv 
will beineffect 
but had notseriouslysndfrom my heart believed it might be of service might lessen her regrets i would not have suffered in self to trouble you with this account of my family a actions with s recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others 
elinor’s thanks followed this speech with grateful enrnesurest 
attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to marianne from the communication of what had passed 
a i have been more pained 3 said she a by her endeavours to as it him than by all the mist 
for it irritates her in more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthinels can do 
now though at first she will suffer much i am sum she will soon become easier 
have on a she continued after .1 short silence a ever seen mr willoughby since you left him at barton i a yes a he replied gravely since i have 
one meeting was unavoidable 
elinor startled by his manner looked at him anxiously saying 
— a what 
have you met him to 
a i could meet him in no other way 
eliza had confessed to me though most reluctantly the name of her lover 
and when he returned to town which was within a fortnight after myself we met by a interest he to defend i to punish his conduct 
e mtumcd announced and the meeting therefore never got abroad elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of thin 
but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it

and so imperfectly have i discharged my trust

7 a is she still in town s a no 
as soon as she recovered from her lying-in for i found her near her delivery i removed her and her child into the country and there she remains recollecting soon afterwards that he was probably dividing elinor from her sister he put an end to fill visit receiving from her again the use grateful acknowledgments and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him

hen the particulars of this conversation were repeated by miss dashwood to her sister an very soon were their effect on her was entire 
such as e former had hoped to see 
not that anne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention made neither objection nor remark attern send no vindication of willoughby and seemed to shew yet her tears that she felt it to be impossible 
but though this behaviour assured elinor that the conviction his guilt emu carried home to her mind 
this has she saw with satisfaction the effect of it in her no anger avoiding colonel brandon when he called in her speaking to him even voluntarily speaking with it kind of compassionate respect and though she saw her spirits lest violently irritated than before 
the did not see her less wretched 
her mind did become settled but it was settled in a gloomy dejecu'on 
she felt the loss of willoughhy’s character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart

she m commended it to her daughters therefore by all am not to shorten their visit to mr jennings 
the length of which though never exactly ﬁxed had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks variety of occupations 
of objects and of company which could not be secured at barton would be invited 
she there and i t yet she hoped that marianne at times into come interest beyond herself and even into some amusement much an the idea of both might now be spared by her 
sense and sensibility 
-5 from all danger of seeing willoughby again her mother considered her to be at least equally safe in town as in the country since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all who call themselves her friends 
design could never bring them in each other way 
negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise 
and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of london than even in the retirement of barton where it might force him before her while pa g that visit at allenham on his marriage which mrs gnuhwood from 
foreseeing at first as a probable event had brought herself to expect as a certain one 
she had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were 
a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of february and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother 
marianne had promised to be guided by her mother opinion and she submitted to it therefore without opposition though it proved perfectly different from what she wished and expected though she felt it to be entirely wrong formed on mistaken grounds and that by requiring her longer continuance in london it deprived her of the only possible alleviation of her wretchedness the personal sympathy of her mother and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent her ever known a moment's rest 
but it was a matter of great consolation to her that what broughtevil to herself would bring good to her sister 
and elinor on the other hand suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid edward entirely comforted herself by thinking that though their longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness it would be better for marianne than an immediate return into devonahire

marianne yielded to her sister s entreaties and consented to go out with her and mrs jennings one morning for half an hour 
she expressly conditioned however for paying no visits 
and would do no more than accompany them to grants in sackville-street where elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother 
when they stopped at the door mrs jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call 
and as she had no business at gray s 
it was resolved that while her young friends transacted theirs she should pay her visit and return for them 
6 sense and sensibility 
on ascending the stairs the miss duhwoods find so many people before them in the room that there was not i person at liberty to attend to their orderl 
and they were obliged to wait 
all that could be done to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession 
one gentleman only was standing there and it is probable that elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despstch 
but the compactness of his eye and the s delicacy of his taste proved to be beyond his politeness 
he was giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself and till its size that and ornaments were determined 
all of which a ten examining and debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop were equally arranged by his own inventive fancy 
he had no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies than what was comprised in dim or four very broad stares 
a kind of notice which served to impress on elinor the remembrance of a person and face of strong natural sterling inrigniﬁcance though adorned in the first after of fashion 
marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment on this impertinent examination of their features and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick-cases resented to his inspection remaining unconscious of it all 
for she was as we able to collect her thoughts within herself and be as ignorant of what was passing around her in mr gray‘s sex as in her own bed-room 
t last the affair was decided 
the story the old and the pearls all received their appointment an 
the gentleman having named the last day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of the toothpick-case drew on his gloves with leisurely care and bestowing another glance on the miss dashsense and sensible 
25 woods but such a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration walked of with an happy air of real conceit and affected indifference 
elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward and was on the point of concluding it when another gentleman presented himself at her side 
she turned her eyes towards his face and found him with some so rise to be her brother 
heir affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make 3 very creditable appearance in mr gray’s shop 
john bath was really far from being sorry to see his sisters again 
it rather gave them i action 
and his inquiries after their mother were mile and attentive 
nor found that he and fanny had been in town two days 
i wished very much to call upon you yesterday a mind he a but it was impossible for we were obliged to take harry to see the wild beam at exeter exchange and we spent the rest of the day with mrs femrs 
harry was vastly pleased 
thus morning i had fully intended to call on you if i could possibly and a spare half-hour but one has always so much to do on lint coming to town 
i am come here to speak farm n seal 
but to 
morrow i think i shall certainly be a e to call in berkeley-string and be introduced to your friend mrs jennings 
i demand she is a woman of very good fortune 
and the middleton too you must introduce me to 11:01 
as my mother-in-law’l relations i shall be happy to show them every respect 
they are excellent neighbours to you in the county i understand a excellent indeed 
their attention to our comfort their friendliness in every particular is more than i can express 
i am extremely glad to hear it upon my word 
28th s sense and sensibili‘i'y 
extrensd glad indeed 
but so it oughttobe 
they arepeo eof hrgefmmdieymnlatedwmand every civility and accommodatiogethxt can serve to make your situation leannt might reasonably expected 
and so you are most comfortably settled hit your little cottage and want for nothing 
edward brought us a most charming account of the place 
the most complete thing of in kind he said that ever was and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond anything 
it was a great satisfaction to us to hear it i assure ou 
elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother 
and was not sorry to be red the necessity of answering him by the arrival of mrs jennings’s servant who am so tell her that his mistress waited for them it the door 
mr dashwood attended them down stairs vm introduced to mrs jennings at the door of her carriage and repeating his hope of being able to call on them the next day look leave 
his visit was duly paid 
he came with a pretence at an a long from their sister-in-law for not coming too 
a t she was to much engaged with her mother that really the had no leisure for going anywhere.” mrs jennings however assured him directly that she should not stand upon ceremony for the were all cousin or something like it an she should d certainly wait on mrs john dashwood very soon and bring her sisters to see her 
his manners to in though calm were perfectly kind 
to mrs jennings most attentive civil 
and on colonel brandon’s coming in soon after himself he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say that he only wanted to know him to be rich to be equally civil to him 
after staying with them half an hour he asked elinor to walk with him to conduit-street and introduce him to sir john and lady middleton 
the weather was sense and sensibility 
-5 remarkath line and she readily assented 
as soon as were out of the house his inquiries began 
a who is colonel brandon 
is he a man of fortune up a 
yes 
he has a v good to in donetshire.” i am glad of incl-ilse gentlemanlike man and i think elinor i may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life 2 me brother 
what do you mean i a he likes you 
i observed him sorrows and am convinced of it 
what is the amount of his june is 
i believe about two thousand 3-year.” a two thousand appear 
a andthen working himself up to e pitch of enthusiastic generosity he added a elinor i wish with all my hurt it were nice as much for our sakes 
and i believe you a lied elinor a but i am very sure that colonel baron has not the smallest with of marrying rue 
a you are mistaken elinor 
you are very much mistaken 
a very little trouble on your side secures him 
perhaps just at resent he may be undecided 
the smallness of your liirtunc may make him long back 
his friends may all advise him against it 
but some of those little attendant and encouragement which ladies can no easily give will fix him in spite of himself 
and there no reason why you should not try for him 
it is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side 
in short you know as to an nmrchmem of that kind it is quite out of the question the objections are insurmountable have too much sense not to see all that 
colonel brandon must be the man 
and no civility shall be wanting an my part to make him pleased with you and your family 
it ii a match that mr give universal satisfaction 
11 short it is a kind of thing that 
— lowering his voice to an important whisper 
no sounds and sausrnrurv 
a will be exceedingly welcome to all parties recollecting himself however he added that is i mean to lay 
your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled fanny particularly for she has your interest very much at heart assure you 
and her mother too mrs fear a very good 
natured woman i am are it would give her great pleasure the aid as much the other day elinor would not vouch any answer 
a it would be something remarkable now a he continued a something droll if fanny should have a brother and i a sister settling at the same time 
and yet it is not very unlikely a world edward ferraro 3 said elinor with resolution a going to be married 
a it is not actually settled but there in such a thing in agitation 
he has a most excellent mother 
mrs terms with the utmost lilx-rnlity will come forward and settle on him a thousand appear if the match takes place 
the lady is the honourable miss barton only daughter of the late lord barton with thirty thousand pounds 
a very desirable connexion on both sides and i have not a doubt of its taking place in time 
a thousand year is a great deal for a mother to give away to make over for ever 
but mr ferraro has a noble irit 
to give you another instance of her liberality 
be other day as soon as we came to town aware that money could not he very plenty with us just now the put banknotes into fanny's hands to the amount of two hundred pounds 
and extremely acceptable it is for we must live at a great expense while we are here he paused for her assent and companion 
and the forced herself to say 
a your expeneel both in town and country must certainly be considerable but your income is a large one a not so large i dare say as many people suppose 
sense and sensibility 
as i do not mean to complain however 
it is undoubtedly a comfortable one and i hope will in time he better 
the enclosure of norland common now carrying on is a most serious drain 
and then i have made a little purchaae within this half-year 
am kingharn farm on must remember the place where old been used to give 
the land was so very desirable for me in every res act i immediately adjoining my own property that i eat it my duty to buy it 
i could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands 
a mr must pay for his convenience and it but coat me a vast deal of money a more than you think it really and intrineically worth 
who i hope not that 
i might have sold it again the next day for more than i gave but with regard to the purchawmoney i might have been very unfortunate indeed 
for the stocks were at that time so low that if i had not happened to have the necessary sum in m banker’s hand i must have sold out to very great loss 
2 elinor could only smile 
other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to norland 
our respected father an you well know bequeathed all the stanhill effects that remained at norland and very valuable they were to your mother 
far be it for me to repine at his doing so 
he had an undouth right to dispose of his own property as he chose 
but in consequence of it we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen china c. to supply the place of what was taken away 
you may guess after all these expenses how very ives must be from being rich and how acceptable an ferraro i kindness is a certainly a said elinor 
and assisted by her liberalitylhgpeyoumayyetlivetobeinmy circumstance 
by sense and sensibility 
another ear or two may do much toward it he travel ied 
“hithoweverdiereit m ll a great d to be done 
there it not a change laid of fanny greenhouae and nothing but the plan of the flower-garden marked out a where in the greenhoule to be i a upon the knoll behindthe house 
the old walnuttreel are all come down to make room for it 
it will be a very one object from many part of the park and the flower-garden will slope down just before it 
and be exceedingly pretty 
we have cleared away all the old short that grew in watched over the bows elinor kept her concern and her venture to herself and was very thankful that marianne was not present to share the provocation 
having now said enough to make all poverty clear and do away the ncccluity of buying a pair of marrying for each of his sisters in his next visit at gray‘s hit droughts took a cheerfuller turn and he began to congratulate elinor on having much a friend as my jennings 
she seems a most valuable woman indeed 
her house her style of living all bespeak an exceeding good income and it it an acquaintance that has not i yet been of great use to you hitherto but in the end may prove materially advantageou 
her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour 
and indeed it speaks altogether so great a regard for you that in all probability when the dies you will not be forgotten 
she must have a neat deal to leave nothing at a i should rather supposed 
for the had only her jointure which will descend to her children a but it in not to be imagined that ehelivel up to her income 
few people of common prudence will do tbar 
and whatever the saves the will be able to dispose of a sense and sense 
by 1 
63 1 and do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters than to us 
a her daughters are both exceedingly well married and therefore i can not perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther 
whereas in my opinion by her taking so much notice of you and treating you in this kind of way she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration which a conscientious woman would not disregard 
nothing can be kinder than her behaviour 
and she can hardly do all this without being aware of the expectations she raises 
a but she raises none in those most concerned 
indeed brother your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries on too far a i yet to be sure a said he seeming to recollect himself people have little have very little in their power 
but my dear elinor what is the matter with marianne 
— she looks very unwell has lost her colour and is grown quite thin 
is she ill 
7 a she is not well she has had a nervous complaints on her for several weeks i am sorry for that 
at her time of life nothing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever 
hers has been a very short one 
she was as handsome s girl lad september as any i ever saw and as likely to attract the men 
there was something in her style of beauty a to please them particularly 
i remember fanny used my that she would marry sooner and better than you did 
not but what she is exceedingly fond of you 
but so it happened to strike her 
she will be mistaken however 
i question whether marianne now will marry a man worth more than ever or six hundred year at the most and time very much deceived if you do not do better 
dorsetshirel i know very little of dorsetshire but my dear elinor i shall be exceedingly y glad to know more of it 
and i think can answer or your by sense and sensibility 
having fanny and myself among the earnest and best pleased of your vinitorl.” elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood 
of her marrying colonel brandon 
but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished and he was really resolved on feeling an intimacy with that gentleman and promoting the marriage by every ble attention 
he had compunction enough l3” having done nothing for his sisters himself to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal 
and an offer from colonel brandon or a legacy from my jennings wait the easiest mean of stopping for his own neglect 
they were lucky enough to and lady middleton at home and sir john came in before their visit ended 
abundance of civility paused on all hides 
sir john was manly to like anybody and though mr dunlin did not come to know much about horses he noon set him down as a very good-natured fellow 
while lady middleton saw enough of fashion in his a dance to think his as acquaintance worth having 
and s dashwood 
went away lighted with both 
a i shall have a charming account to carry to f anne a aid he an he walked back with his sister 
a lady middleton is really a most elegant woman s such a woman an i am sure fanny will be glad to know 
and mr jennings too an exceeding well-behaved woman though not so elegant as her daughter 
your linen need not have any ecruple even of visiting her which to say the truth has been a little the case and very naturally 
for we only knew that mr jennings wan the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way 
and fanny and my fears were both itrongly prepoueoaed that she nor her daughters were such kind of women an fanny would like to associate with 
but now i can any her a man iatinl‘actory account of both sense and smsrmu-rv 
-5 chum 115317 
r8 john dashwood had in much confidence in her husband's judgment that the waited the very next d both on my jennings and her daughter 
and her con dance was rewarded by sending even the former even the woman with whom her sisters were staying b no real unworthy her notice 
and an for lady middleton ill 
found her one of the most charming women in the world lady middleton wan eqtu pleased with mr dashwood 
there wan a kind of cold-hearted telﬁshnest on both sides which mutually enacted shem 
and hoped with each other in an ill i i 135313 and a general want of made up by the name manner however which recommended an john dashwood to the good notion of lady middleton did not wait the fancy of me jennings and to her he appeared nothing more than a little proudlooking woman of no i address who met her hunhnnd’e liners without any uﬂiction nnrl nlmmt without having anything to m to them for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on rkclcy-rtreet she sat at lean seven minutes and a half in silence 
elinor wanted very much to know though she did not chuse to ask whether edward was then in town 
but nothing would have induced fanny voluntarily to mention his name before her till able to tell her that his with miss barton was resolved on or till her husband's expectations on colonel london were answered 
because she believed them still so very much attached to each other that they could not be too aedulounly divided in word and deed on ever ocacion 
the intelli once however which by would not give noon bow from another quarter 
lucy came very ii 
e 66 guns and snusmruw 
shortly to claim elinor’s companion on being unable to act edward though he had arrived in town with mr and mr dashwood 
he dared not come to bartlett'buildingt for fear of detection and though their mutual impatience to meet wet not to he told they could do nothing at present but write 
edward assured them herself of hit lacing in town within a very short time by twice calling in berkeleyureet 
twice wan his card found on the table when they returned from their coming engagement 
elinor was pleased that he had called and still more pleased that the had missed him 
the dashwood were it prodigioutly delighted with the middleton that though not much in the habit of giving anything they determined to give them a dinner and won after their acquaintance began invited them to dine in harley-street where they had taken a very good soon for three months 
their sisters and mrs jennings a were invited likewise and john dashwood wan care to secure colonel brandon who always glad to be where the mine dashwood were 
received his eager civilitiel with some surprise but much more pleasure 
they were to met mr ferraro 
but elinor could not learn whether her jane were to be of the party 
the expectation of seeing over however was enough to make her interest in the engagement 
for though the could now meet edward s mother without that strong anxiety which had once dprornioed to attend such an introduction though the cool now see her with perfect indifference an to her union of herself her desire of being in tom 
any with a ferraro her curiosity to know what the wan like was a lively an ever 
the interest with which she thus anticipated the party was soon uftew/arda increased more fully than yleuantly by her hearing that the m steele 
were also to be at it sense and sensibility 
-5 so well had they recommended themselves to lady middleton so agreeable had their neliduitiee made them to her that though lucy wan certainly not elegant and her sister not even genteel she was an reads sir john to ask them to spend a week or two in conduit-amen and it happened to be rtieularl convenience the miss steele at soon as the ashw ’ invitation known that their visit should begin a few days before the party took place 
their claims to the notice of mr john dashwood an the niece of the gentleman who for many year had had the care of her brother might not have done much however towards procuring them came at her table 
but as lady middleton’s guests they must be welcome 
and such who had long wanted to be reasonably known to the family to have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to lease them had seldom been ha her in her life than she was on receiving mrs john ashwood’e card 
on elinor its effect was very different 
she immediately to determine that edward who lived with his mother moat be asked no hit mother wet to part given his lines 
and to see him forftllie first time after that passed in the cox s of a la 
she hardly knew how she could bear itplan yes these apprehensions perhaps were not founded entirely on reason and certainly not at all on truth 
they were relieved however not her own recollection but by the goodwill of lucy who believed herself to be inﬂicting a severe disappointment when he told her that edward certainly would not be in harley-street on i‘ueeda end even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther y minding her that he will kept away by that extreme a eton for herself which he wild not conceal when they were together 
by sense and smstnxu'rv 
the important tuesday mine that was to introduce the two young ladies to thin formidable mother-iu-law

a laid lucy a they walked up the stairs together 
for the middletonamved to directly after my jennings 
that they all followed the least at the me time 
a there in nobody here but you that can feel for me 
i declare i can hardly mud 
good gracious 
in a moment i shall see the person that all my happiness depend on 
that in to be my mother 
— elinor could have given her inuuedinte relief by euggerting the possibility of its being mimorton mother rather than her own whom they were about to behold 
but instead of doing that she secured her and with great asperity that she did pity her 
to the utter amazement of lucy who though really uncomfortable bent-if hoped at lean to be an object of inepreuiblc envy to elinor 
mrs ferraro was a little thin woman upright even to formality in her figure and serious even to journal in her aspect 
her complexion was allow and her features small without beauty and naturally without expression but a lucky promotion of the brow had procured her countenance from the disgrace of inlipidity by giving it the strong characters of privy and ill-nature 
she was not a woman of many words 
for unlike people in general the proportioned them to the number of her idea and of the few syllables that did coupe her not one fell tothe share of mine dashwood whom the eyed with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events 
elinor could not now be made unhappy by this be 
haviour 
a few month ago it would have hurt her exceedingly 
but it was not in mr ferraro power in diru'eu her b it now 
and the difference of her manner to the in steele 
a difference which seemed sense and situsrurmv 
-5 purpose made to humble her more 
only amused her 
he can d not but smile to see the tediousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person 
for lucy was particularly distinguished 
whom of all others had they known as much as she did they would have been most anxious to mortify 
while she herself who had comparatively no power to wound them sat pointedly slighted is both 
but while she smiled at a graciousneu so misapp bed she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from which it spnm nor observe the studied attentions with which the miss steele courted its con tinunnce without thoroughly deqrising them all four 
lucy was all explanation on being so honourably distinguished 
and miss steele wanted only to be treated about dr. davi e s to be perfectly happy 
the dinner was a grand one the servants were numerous and everything bespoke the distress inclination for shew and the sisters inability to support it 
in spite of the in improvements and additions which were making to the land estate and in spite of its owner having once been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a loss nothing gave any s tom of that iudigenee which he had tried to infer rum it 
no of so kind six t of conversation red quite the deﬁcienzeyp was considenblefppfl-oltn dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing and his wife had still less 
but there was no peculiar disgrace in this for it was very much the one with the chief of their visitors who almost ill laboured under one or other of these disqualiﬁcation for being agreeable 
want of sense either natural or improved 
want of elegance want of spirits or want of tent r 
hen the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner this power was particularly evident for the gentlemen bad supp led the discourse with some variety to sir

— the variety of policy m indoaing land and breaking hornet 
but then it wan all over and one only engaged the ladietill coffee came in \vhirhwu the comparative height of he dashwood and lady middleton’l second son wm who were nearly of the nine age 
had both the children been there the affair might have been determined too easily by meaaurin them at once 
but ii harry only was present it we oon'ectun-l exertion on both sides and everybody had a right to be equally punitive in their opinion and to repeat it over and over again an often an they liked 
the parties stood thus the two mother though each really convinced that her own son war the tallest politely decided in favour of the other 
the two grandmotherl with not let partiali but more iincerit were nail men in no rest of their own deacendany t. d ye pp“ lucy who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other thought the boy were both remarkably tall for their age and could not conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world between them 
and miss steele with yet greater addreu gave it an fact an she could in favour of each 
elinor having once delivered her of union on william side by which the offended mr lucas and fanny still more did not see the necessity of enforced it by any farther insertion 
and marianne when end on for hen offended them all by declaring that the had no opinion to give up the had never thought about it

and the curious of the of being of course excited they were handed round for general inspection 
mr ferraro not aware of their bung elinor’s work particularly requested to look at them 
and after they had received the gratifying testimony of lady middleton’l in the son farm presented them to her mother conrideratdy informing her at the lame time that they were done by miss dashwood

a very pretty 1

for colouring a little the immediate

do you not think they are something in miss barton s after of string moral so do paint most delightfully 
how beautifully her sins lamp in done

a beautifully indeed 
but a done 
everything well 
marianne could not bear thin 
she wan already greatly displeased with mrs ferraro 
and inch ill-timed praise of another at elinor’s expenle though the had 22 sense and sensibility 
not any notion of what was principally meant by it provoked her immediately to any with warmth a thin in admiration of a very particular kind 
what in miss barton to us who own or who early for her 
it in elinor of whom we think and seek and so ‘ng the took the ecrecna out of her innerin-law’n inn to admire them remain a they ought to be admired 
my fanny looked exceedingly angry and drawing herself up more niﬂly than ever pronounced in retort thin bitter phillips a miss barton is lord morton’s daughter.’ fanny looked very angry too and her husband we all in a fright at his sisters audacity 
elinor wan much more hurt by marianne’s warmth than the had been by what reduced it 
but colonel brandon’s eyes as they were fixed on marianne declared that he noticed only what wan amiable in it 
the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister slighted on the valley into 
v p0ivfarinnne’e feelings did not stop here 
the cold insolence of mrs femn’ general behaviour to her litter seemed to her to foretell auch dill'icultiee and distress to elinor as her own wounded heart taught her to think of with horror 
and urged by a strong impulse of affectionate sensibility she moved after a moment to her sister s chair and putting one am round her neck and one check close to here laid in a low but a her voice a dear dear elinor don’t mind them 
on let them make you unhappy she could by no more 
her iriu were quite overcome and hiding her face on linor‘l shoulder the burst into tears everybody’e attention was called and almost everybody wan concerned 
colonel london rose up and went to them without knowing what he did 
mrs jennings with a very intelligent a ah 
poor dear a sense 
and sensibility 
13 immediately gave her her salts 
and sir john felt no desperately enraged against the author of this nervous duties that he instantly changed his neat to one close by lucy steele and gave her in a whisper a brief account of the whole chucking aﬂnir 
in a few minutes however marianne was recovered enough to at an end to the bustle and sit down among the rest 
ought her spirits retained the impression of what had passed the whole evening 
poor marianne 
a said her brother to colonel brandon in a low voice as noon as he could secure his attention a she has not such good health as her sister 
she is very nervous 
she has not elinor’s conetitution 
and one must allow that there in something very trying to a young woman who bar been a beauty in the loss of her mnal attractions 
you would not think it perhaps at marianne tutu remarkably handsome a few months ago 
quite as handsome as elinor 
now you see it is all one chspttr 975w 
linor’s curiosity to see mrs ferraro was satisfied 
she had found in her everything that could tend to make a farther connexion between the families undesirable 
she had seen enough of her pride her meanness and her determined rejudice ngninn herself to comprehend all the edifice ties that inuet have pleased the engagement 
and returned the marriage of edward and herself had he been otherwise free 
and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her own sake that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of mr ferrarl’ creation preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice or 74 us and smsmu'rv 
any solicitude for her good or at lean if die did not bring herself quite to rejoice in edward bu'ng letters to lucy she determined that had lucy been more amiable the age to have rejoiced 
she wondered that any nu could be in very much elevated by the civility of mr few

putting it had not onlybeeodedared by lucy’s eye at the time but waadeclnrod over again the next morning more openly 
for at her particular desire lady middleton let her down in berkeleystrcct on the chance of seeing elinor alone to tell her how happy the will chance proved a lucky one 
for a from mrs palmer won after she arrived carried jennings away 
a my dear friend a cried lucy a soon as they were

but there wan no reason in the word d why a ferraro should seem to like me if she did nob 
and her liking me in thing 
you that ask me out of my satisfaction 
am sure it will all end well and there will be no difficulties at all to what i used to think 
mr ferraro a charming woman and do in your sister 
they are both delightful women indeed 
if i wonder i who never hear you say how agreeable mrs dashwood was up 9 to this elinor had no answer to make and did not attend t any 
are you ill miss dashwood 
— you seem low 
you doubt speak 
— sure you and well 
7 a i never wan in better health.” 
i am glad of it with all my heart but really you did not look it 
i ihould be so so to have you all 
— you that have been the greatest come on to me in the world 
— heaven known what i ihould have done without your friendship 
elinor tried to make a civil unjust though doubu'ng her own oucceol 
but it learned to satisfy lucy for the directly replied 
indeed i am ieerﬁmly convinced of your regard for me and next to dear i love it in the greatest comfort i have 
poor edward 
but now there in one good thing 
we shall be able to meet and meet pretty often for lady middleton he delighted with mr e wood 1 we shall be a good deal in harley-meet i due a and edward spend half his time with his sister 
dear lady middleton and mrs ferraro will 76 says and snusrmu-rv 
visit now 
and mrs ferrarund your sister were both so good to say more than once they should always be glad to see me 
— they are such charming women s 
i am sure if ever you tell your sister what i think of her you can not speak too high but elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she saw 
tell her sister 
lucy continued i am sure should have seen it in a moment if mrs ferraro had took a dislike to me 
if she had only made me a formal curtsey for instance without saying a word and never after had took any notice of me and never looked at me in a pleasant way 
you know what i imam 
if i had been treated in that forbidding sort of way i should have gave it all up in d or 
i could not have stood it 
for where she does i like i know it in most violent elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph by the door s being thrown open the servants announcing mr ferraro and edward’s immediater walking in 
a it was a very awkward moment 
and the countenance of each showed that it was so 
they all looked exceedingly foolish 
and edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again as to advance farther into it 
the very circumstance in its unpleasantest form which they would each have been most anxious to avoid had fallen on them 
they were not only all three together but were together without the relief of any other person 
the ladies recovered themselves ﬁrst 
it was not lucy’s business to put herself forward and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up 
she could therefore only loo 
her tenderness and after slightly addressing him said no more 
but elinor had more to do 
and so anxious was she for his sake and her own to do it well that the forced herself after a moment s recollection to welcome him sense and sensibility 
15 with a look and manner that were almost easy and almost a 
and another struggle another effort still improve them 
she would not allow the presence of lucy nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself to deter her from saying that she was yet to see him and that she had very much regretted a g from home when he called before in berkeley-meet 
she would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which as a friend and almost a relation were his due by the observant eyes of lucy though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her 
her manners gave some assurance to edward and he led courage enough to sit down 
but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion which the case rendered reasonable though his sex might make it rare 
for his heart had not the indifference of lucy s nor could his conscience have quite the ease of elinor 
lucy with a demure and settled air seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others and would not say a word 
and almost everything that war said proceeded from elinor who was led to volunteer little information about her mother this their coming to town c. which edward ought to have inquired about but never did 
her exertions did not no here 
for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroitu disposed as to determine under pretence of fetching marianne to leave the others by themselves 
and she really did it and but in the handsomest manner for she loitered away several minutes 5 on the landing place with the most high-minded fortitude before she went to her lines 
when that was once done however it was time for the raptures of edward to cease 
for marianne’s joy hurried her into the drawing rooms immediatel

why did you not come

a my dear edward thin must not be 
and drawn him a little aside she whispered her persuasion that say could not stay much longer 
but even this encouragement failed for he would go 
and lucy who would have said him had his visit luted two hours noon afterwards went away 
a what can bring her here is often i 
said marianne on her leaving them 
i could the not see that we wanted her gone 
how teazing to edward 
7 a why no s 
we were all his within and lucy has been the longest known to him of any

marianne looked at her steadily and aid you know elinor that this is a kind of talking which i can not bear 
if on only hope to have your assertion contradicted an must suppose to he the case you ought to recollect that i am the last person in the world to do it 
i can not descend to be tricked out of sunrancet that are not really wanted she then left the room 
and elinor dared not follow her to yet more for bound as the wall by her promise of secrecy to such she could give no information that would convince arianne 
and painful an the consequence of her still continuing in an error might be the was obliged to submit to it 
all that the could hope was that edward would not often expose her or himself to the direct of hearing marianne’s miataken warmth nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended their recent meeting

this i few day 
after thin meeting the newlpogen announced to the world that the lady of thomas palmer euq. woe cafer delivered of a inn and heir 
a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph at least to all these intimate connection 
who knew it before this event him by important to mrjenniogr’a happineu produced a temporary duration in the disposal of her time and influence in a. like degree the engagement of her young friends 3 for she wished to he at much a possible with charlotte she went thither every morning at soon a the wan dressed and did not return till late in the evening 
and the mine duhwoodr at the particular request of the middleton t the whole every day in conduit-meet 
for own comfort they would much rather have remained at lent all the morning in mrs jenninge’e home 
but it war not a thing the urged against the wishes of every body 
their hour were therefore made over to lady i elton and the two miss steele 
by whom their can 
a war in fact a little valued use it was profeuedly ill in hey had too much sense to be delinbk companions to theformer 
and by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye it intruding on their ground and charles the kindness which they wanted to monolile 
ah nothing could be more life than lady middleton’l behaviour to elinor in marianne she did not really like them at all 
became they neither flattered herself nor her children she could not believe them good-natured 
and became they were fond of tending she fancied them satirical perhaps without exactly knowing what it w to be atrial 
but 16¢ 11. r 82 sense and snusmm'rv 
did not signify 
it wan censure in common see and energy given 
heir reoence we a restraint both on her and on lucy 
t checked the idleness of one and the business of the other 
lady middleton wan ashamed of doing nothing before them and the latter which lucy wan maid to think of and adminieter at other times the end they would despise her for observing 
miss steele was the least diecompoeed of the three by their pretence 
and it was in their power to reconcile her to it entirely 
would either of them only have given her a full and minute account of the whole affair between marianne and mr willoughby the would have thought herself amply rewarded for the carriage of the best place by the ﬁre after dinner which their arrival occacioned 
gout thin conciliation wan not granted 
for though the often threw out expressions of pity for her title to elinor and more than once do ped a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before are no effect we produced but a look of indifference from the former or of disgust in the latter 
an effort even yet lighter might have made her their friend 
would they only have laughed at her about the doctor 
but to little were they any more than the other inclined to oblige her that if sir john dined from home the might spend a whole day without hearing any other millery on the subject than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself 
all these jealous and discontenta however were to totally unsuspected by my jennings that she thought it a delightful thing for the girls to be together 
and general congratulated her young friends every night on having escaped the company of a no i old woman to long 
she joined them sometimes at if john s and sometimes at her own house 
but wherever it wan the army came in excellent spirits full of delight and sense and sensibility 
83 pomnce attributing charlotte’s well-doing to her own care and ready to give so exact so minute a detail of her situation as only miss steele had curiosity enough to desire 
one thin m disturb her 
and of that she made her daily come into 
mr palmer maintained the common but unfatherly opinion among his sex of all infants hein alike 
and though she could plainly perceive at i rent times the most striking resemblance between this baby and every one of his relations on both sides there was no convincing his father of it 
no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like of gay other baby of the same age 
nor could he even brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of in being the rest child in the world 
i come now to the relation of a misfortune which about this time befcll mrs john dashwood 
it so happened that while her two sisters with mrs jennings were first calling on her in harley-street 
another of her acquaintance had dropped in 
a circumstance in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her 
but while the imaginations a other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct and to decide on it by slight appearances onc’s happiness must in some measure be always at the more of chance 
on the present instance this last-arrived ady allowed her fancy so far to outrun truth and probability that on merely hearing the name of the miss dashwood and a understanding them to be mr dashwood s sisters she immediately concluded them to be staying in harley street 
on this misconstruch produced within 3 s or two afterwards cards of invitation for them as we as for their brother and sister to a small musical party at her house 
the consequence of which was that mrs john dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly reat inconvenience of sending her carriage for the miss dashwood but what was still 8 sense and sensibility 
wont must be subject to all the unpleasant of up ring to treat them with attention and who could i that the might not expect to go out with her a second time the power of disappointing them it was true must always be here 
but that was not err 
for when people are determined on a mode of con act which they know to be wrong they feel injured by the sex reception of anything better from them 
anne had now been brought by degrees so much into the habit of going out every day that it we 
become a matter of indikemnce to her whether she went or not and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every evening s engagement though without expecting the smallest amueernent from any and very often without knowing till the last moment where it wan to take her 
to her dress and appearance she was growing so perfectly indiﬁ'urcnt on not to bestow half the consideration on it during the whole of her toilette which it received from miss steele in the first live minute of their being together when it was finished 
nothing escaped lur minute observation and general curioaity 
she saw everything and asked everything 
was never away till she knew the price of every rest of marianne’s dress 
could have guessed the sum s of her gowns altogether with better judgment than marianne herself and was not without hope of finding out before they parted how much her washing cost per week and how much the had every year to spend upon lrcraclf 
the impertinence of these kind of scrutinres moreover was generally concluded with a compliment which though meant an it doctor was considered by marianne s the greatest impertinence of all 
for after undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown the colour of her shoes and the arrangement of her hair the was almost sure of being told that upon a her word she looked vastly smart and she dared to say would make a gate many conquests.” sense and sensible 
-5 with such encouragement as this was she dismissed on the present occasion to her brothers caniage 
which they were ready to enter ever minutes after it stopped at the door a punctuality not very agreeable to their sister-in-law who had preceded them to the house of her acquaintance and was there hoping for some delay on their part that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman 
the mud of the evening were not very remarkable 
the party like other musical parties comprehended a great many people who had real taste for the performance and a great many more who had none at nil 
and the perfomicrs themselves were 
as usual in their own estimation and that of their immediate friends the first private performers in england 
as elinor was neither musical nor affecting to he so she made no scruple of turning away her eyes from the grand pianoforte whenever it suite her and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp and a violencello would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the room 
in one of these excursive glances she perceived among the group of young men the very he who had given them a lecture on toothpick-cases at gray 
she perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself and speaking familiarly to her brother 
and had determined to find out his name from the latter when they both came towards her and mr dashwood introduced him to her as mr robert fen-an 
he addressed her with easy civility and twisted his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done that he was exact the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by lucy 
happy had it been for her if her regard for edward had depended less on his own merit than on the merit of his nearest relations 
for then his brother s bow must have given the fishing stroke to what ill-humour of his mother 8 sense nun sensrnru-rv 
and sister would have begun 
but while the wondered at the difference of the two young men the did not and that the tempting and conceit of the one put her at all out of charity with the modest and worth of the other 
why they were different robert explained to her himself in the more of a quarter of an hour conversation 
for talking of his 
brother and lamenting the extreme gaucberic which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper society he candidly and generous attributed it much ll ll to any natural deﬁciency than to the fortune of a private education 
while he himself though probably without any particular any material euperiori s nature merely from the advantage of a. public echoo wan an well fitted to mix in the world as any other man 
a upon my soul 4 he added a i believe it is nothing more and so i often tell my mother when she in grieving about it 
my dear madam 5 i always any to her you must make yourself easy 
the evil in now irrenrcdiablc and it has been entirely your own doing 
why would you be persuaded by my uncle sir robert against your own judgment to place edward under private station at the most critical time of his life 
if on her only sent him to weetminater at well at myself instead of sending him to mr parts all this would have been prevented this ll the way in which i always consider the matter and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error 
elinor would not oppose his opinion became whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage of a public school she could not think of edward’s abode in mr pratt s family with any notion 
a you repaid in ﬂevonshire i think was till next observation in a cottage near dawlish.” elinor set him right as to its situation and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody could live in sense and sensmu'rv 
-5 devonehire without living near dawlieh 
he bestowed :1 hearty approbation however on their of use 
a for my own part a said he i am exceedingly fond of a cottage 
there it always to much comfort so much elegance about them 
and i detest 
if i had any money to a me i should buy a la e land and build one mylelf wife s a short dinner of london where i might drive myself down at any time and collect a few friend about me and be happy 
i advise everybody who is going to build to butldyn cottage 
my friend lord courtland came to me the other city on purpose to ask in advice and laid before three different place of noise 
i was to decide on the beat of them 
a my dear courdand 3 said i immediately throwing them all into the lime do not do either of them but b all means build a cottage led that i fancy will the end of it 
a some people imagine that there can be no accommodation no e in a cottage 
but this in all a mistake 
i warm month at my friend elliott’s near dnrtford 
lady elliot with to give a dance 
a but how can it be done 
’ laid the 
a my dear perm-e do tell me how it it to he managed 
there ll not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple and where can the an be 2 7 i immediately saw thatthere could he no guilty in it so i said my dear lady elliot do not be uneasy 
the dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease 
card-tab i may be placed in the drawing-room 
the library may be of for tea and other refrahmentr 
and let the upper set out in the saloon lady elliot wan delighted with the thought 
we entered the dining-room and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple and the affair war ar. ranged precieely after my plan 
so that in fact you lee if people do but know how to set about it every 88 says and seusruru'rv 
comfort may be at well enjoyed in a come as in the most lpaciout dwelling 
elinor agreed to it all for she did not think he deserved the comic liment of rational opposition as john dan wood had no more pleasure in music than hit eldest litter his mind was equally at liberty to fix on anything else 
and a thought struck him during the evening which he communicated to his wife for her approbation when they got home 
the consideration of mrs dennison’s mistake in supposing his linen their guests had suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become much while mrs jennings s end gagemenu kept her from home 
the expense would be nothing the inconvenience not more 
and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy of his conscience inled out to be requisite to its complete enfranchnement from his promise to hit father 
fanny wan startled at the proposal 
a i do not see how it can be done a said she a without aﬁi'onting lady middleton for they spend every day with her 
otherwise i should be exceedingly glad to do it 
you know i am always ready to pay them any attention in my power as my taking them out this evening them 
but they are lady middleton’s viiton 
how can i ask them away from her 
her husband but with great humility did not see the force of her objection 
they had already spent a week in this manner in conduit-street and lady middleton could not be displeased at their giving the name number of days to such near relations 
fanny paused a moment and then with fresh vigour u .. a my love i would ask them with all my heart if it was in my power 
but i had just settled within myself to in the miss steele to spend a few days with us 
they are very well-behaved good kind of girls 
and i sense and sensxnm'rv 
-5 think the attention is due to them as their uncle did so very well by edward 
we can ask your sisters some other year you know 
but the miss steele may not being townan more 
am sure will like them 
indeed you like them you know very much already and so does my mother 
and they are such favourites with harry 
mr dashwood was convinced saw the security of inviting the miss steele immediately and his conscience was practised by the resolution of inviting his linen another year 
at the same time however slyly suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless hybringing elinor to town as colonel brandon wife and me a mere visitor 
farm re chin in her so and mud of the deed wit thatyhad produced it were thepuext morning to 
lucy to not her company and her sister for some days in bar street as soon so lady middleton could spare them 
this was enough to make lucy really and reasonably happy 
mrs dashwood seemed actually working for her herself cherishing all her hopes and promoting all her views 
such an opportunity of being with edward and his family was above all things the most material to her interest and such an invitation the most gratifying to her feelings 
it was an advantage that could not he too gratefuly acknowledged nor too speedily made use of 
and the visit to lady middleton which had not before had any precise limits was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days time 
hen the note was shown to elinor s it was within ten minutes after its arrival it gave her for the list time 
some share in the expectations of lucy 
for such a mark of uncommon kindness vouchmfed on so short an acquaintance seemed to declare that the goodwill towards her arose from something more than merely no sense and sbnsibiutv

mr dashwood had never been to much pleased with any young women in her life an the wet with them 5 had given each of them a needle-book made by some emigrant 
called lucy by her christian name 
and did not know whether she should ever be able to part with them 
chili 
ﬁii'ﬂll mrs palmer was to well at the end fortnight that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her 
and correcting herself with visiting her once or twice a day returned from that period to her own lyme and her own habits in which she found the miss dashwood very ready to measure their former share 
about the third or fourth morning after their being that regretted in berkeley-street rl jennings on returning from her ordinary visit to mr palmer entered the drawing-room where elinor was sitting by herself with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful 
and giving her time only to form that idea began directly to justify it by laying waymxwuuam 
we sense and sensibility 91 “lord 
my dear miss dashwood 
have you heard the news p 
no ma'am 
what is it i a a something so strange 
but on shall hear it all 
when i got to mr palmer’s i end charlotte quite in a fuss about the child 
she was sure it was very ill 
it cried and fretted and was all over price as 
i i looked at it directly and a lord 
my dear says i a it is nothing in the world but the red-gum 
7 and nurse said us the same 
but charlotte she would not be sat end so mr donavan was sent for 
and luckily he happened to be just come in from harley-street so he sped over directly and as soon as ever he saw the c d he said just as we did that it was nothing in the world but the red-gum and then charlotte was easy 
and so just as he was going away again it came into my head i am sure i do not know how i happened to think of it but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news 
no upon that he smirked and simpered and looked grave and seemed to know something or other and at last he said in a whisper a for fear any unpleasant report should reach the mud ladies under your ease m to their sisters indisposttion i think it advisable to say that i believe there is no great mean for alarm 
i hope mrs dashwood will do very well 
what is fanny ill 3” that is exactly what i said my dear 
a lord says i a mrs dashwood ill 
’ so then it all aunts out 
and the long and the short of the matter by all i can lenm seems to be this 
mr edward ferraro the very young man i used to joke with you about but however as it turns out i am monstrous glad there never was anything in it mr edward terms it seems has been engaged above this twelvenwnth to my cousin lucy 
— there s for you my dear l 
and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter except fanny 
— so sense and sensibility 
could you have believed such a thing possible q 
there is no great wonder in their liking one another 
but that matter 
should be brought so forward between them and nobody suspect it 
that is strange 
— i never be led to see them together or i am sure i should have and it out directly 
well and to this was kept a great secret for fear of mrs f errand 
and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter 
till this very morning poor fanny who you know is a well-meaning creature but no conjuror t it all out 
a lord 
’ thinks she to herself they are 1 so fond of lucy to be sure they will make no difficulty about it 
7 and so away she went to your sister who was sitting all alone at her carpet-work little suspecting what was to come 
for she had just been saying to your brother on have minutes before that she thought to make a mat between edward and some lord s daughter or other i forget who 
so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride 
she fell into violent hystericl immediately with such scream as reached your brother ears as he was sitting in his own dressing-room downstairs thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country 
so up he ﬂew directly and a terrible scene took lace for lucy was come to them by that time little reading what was going on 
poor soul 
i pity lur 
and i must we think she was used very hardly 
for your sister scolded like any fury and won drove her into a fainting fit 
many she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly 
and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know what to do 
mrs dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house and your mother was forced to go down upon by knees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes 
tom she fell into hysterics again and he was so frightened that he would send for mr donavan and mr donavan found the sense and sensibility 
93 house in all this uproar 
the carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away and they were stepping in as he came of 
poor lucy in such a condition he says she could hardly walk 
and fanny she was almost as bad 
i declare i have no patience with your sister 
and i hope with all my heart it will be a match in spite of her 
lord 
what a kind poor mr edward will be in when he hears of it 
i have his love used so scornfullyl for they say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may 
i should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest of passion 
and mr donavan thinks just the same 
he and i had a great deal of talk about it 
and the best of all is that he is gone back again to harley-street that he may be within call when mrs ferraro is told of it for she was sent for as soon as ever m cousins left the house for your sister was sure :5 wo d be in hysterics too 
and so she may for what i care 
i have no pity for either of them 
i have no notion of people making such a too about money and greatness 
there is no reason on earth why mr edward and lucy should not marry 
for i am cure mrs ferraro may afford to do very well her son 
and though lucy has next to nothing herself she knows better than anybody how in make the most of everything 
and i dare say if mrs fame would only allow him over hundred year she would make as good an a penance with it as anybody else would with eight 
lord how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours 
or a little gger 
with two maid and two men 
andibelievei couldhelpthemtoa housemaid for my patty has a sister out of place that would it them exactly here mrs jennings ceased and as elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts she was able to give such an answer and make such observations as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce

and that the was not like of any extraordinary interesting it

she could hardly determine whether an expectation of its event really was 
— 
though the earnestly tried todrivcawa thenotionofiuheingpouihletoend otherwise than the inrriageof edwardand lucy 
what my errand would by and do though there could not be a douhofiummrgahewaaanxioul m hm 
and still more anxious to know how edward would conduct minnelli 
for i 
she felt much compassion 
— for lucy very little 
and it coat her name pains to procure that lit e 
for the rest of the party none at s 
as mr jmningt could talk on no other subject elinor noon saw the necessity of preparing marianne for in discussing 
— no time war to be lost in undecu‘ving her in making her acquainted with the real trulyand in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by when without betraying that she felt any uneasiness her sister or any resentment against edward 
lilinor’l ollicc was a painful own 
she wan going to remove what the really believed to be her sister s chief consolation 
to give inch particular of edward 25 the feared would ruin him it ever in her good and to make marianne by a resemblance in their situation which to fanny would ocean strong feel all her own disappointment over again 
but unwelcome in such a talk must be it was necessary to be done and elinor therefore hastened to perform it 
shewavery farfromwiahing tadwell our own sense and sensibility 
-5 feelings or to represent herself as suffering much any otherwisethan as the self 
command she had practised since her first knowledge of edward s en a men i but suggest a hint of what was practicable to anne 
her narrau'on was clear and simple 
and though it could not be given without emotion it was not accompanied violent agitation nor in gﬁeﬂ 
that 
belonged rather to the harder for anne listened with horror and cried excessively 
elinor was to be the comfort of others in her own dime-es no less than in theirs 
and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind and a very earnest vindication of edward from every charge but of irnpnulence was readily offered 
but anne for some time would very credit to neither 
edward seemed a second will buy 
and acknowledging as elinor did that she bad owed him most sincerely could she feel less than herself i as for such steele she considered her so totally unnminble so abso utely incapable of attaching s sensible man that she could not be persuaded at first to believe and afterwards to pardon any former affection of edward for her 
she would not even admit it to have been natural 
and elinor left her to be convinced that it was so by that which only could convince her a. better knowledge of mankind 
her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement and the length of use it had existed 
marianne’s feelings had then broken in and put an end to all regularity of detail 
and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress lessen her alarms and combat her resentment 
the first question on her side which led to farther particulars was 
— 
how long has this been known to you elinor 
has he written to you 3 6 sums and sensible 
i have known it the four month 
when lucy that came to barton-park last november the told me in confidence of her engagement 
at those words arianne’l eyes expressed the astonishment which her i could not utter 
after a pane of wonder the exact aimed 
— a four month s 
have you known of this mr month 2 
— elinor concerned it 
that s 
while sending me in all my misery 
but thin been on your heart 2 and i have reached you for being happy 
— a we not at that you should then know how much s was the reverie 
a four months 
cried marianne again 
a so calm 
to cheerful i how have you been supported 
7 a by feeling that i was doing my duty 
my mind to lucy obliged me to be secret 
i owed it to therefore to avoid giving any hint of the truth 
and i owed it to my family and friend not to create in them a solicitude about me which it could not he in my power to satisfy 
marianne seemed much struck 
a i have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother a added elinor 
a and once or twice i have attempted it 
— 
but without betraying my must i never could have convinced you a four months 
— and yet you loved him i eyes 
but i did not love only his 
— and while the comfort of others was dear to me i wan glad to spare them from knowing how much i felt 
now i can think and speak of it with little emotion 
i would not have you suffer on my account 
for i assure you i no longer after materially myself 
i have many thing to support me 
i am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any importance of my own and sense and sensibility 
-5 i have home it as much as possible without spreading it farther 
i acquit edward of all essential miseonduet 
i wish him very happy 
and i am so sure of his always doing his duty that though now he may harbour some regret in the end he must become so 
lucy does not want sense and that is the foundation on which every 
-thingaﬁood m be built 
and after all marianne after that is taking in the idea of a single and constant attachment and all that can be said of one happiness depending entirely on any‘pam'cular person it is not meant 
it is not fit 
it is not possible that it should be so 
edward will marry lucy 
he will marry a woman superior in soon and understanding to half her sex 
and done an habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to m 
a if such is your way of thinking a said marianne of thelossofwhatismostvaluedis so easily be made up by something else our resolution your self-commamz are perhaps a little less to be wondered at 
they are brought more within my comprehension i understand you 
you do not so that i have ever felt much 
for four months riannc i have had all this has no on my mind without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature 
knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you t unable to prepare you for it in the least 
it was to 
me 
it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself whose prior engagement missed all myiprospects 
and told me as i thought with triumph 
his person suspicions therefore i have had to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most deeply interested 
and it has not been only once 
i have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again 
i have known myself to be divided from edward for ever without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire ll 
6 or sense nun sensiiiilitv 
the connexion 
nothing hat proved him unworthy 
nor huanythingdeeluedhimrndilferentwme 
have had to contend against the unkindness of hisitter end the insolence of box mother and have suffered the punishment of an attachment without enjoying iu advantage 
and all this has been going on at a time when no you too well know it has not been my only if you can think me capable of ever feeling s you may suppose that i have suffered now 
he is of mind with which i have brought myself at present to consider the matter the consolation that i have been v willing to submit have been the effect of both and painful exertion g 
they did not spring up of tluerruelvee 1 they did not occur to relieve m spirit at long 
no marianne 
that if i had not been bound to silence perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely 
not even what owed to my dcnrcet friends 
from openly having that i wait my unhappy marianne was quite subdued 
a oh 
elinor 2 she cried a you have made me hate myself for ever 
how barbaroue have i been to you 
— you who have been my only comfort who have borne with me in all my misery who have seemed be only suffering for me s 
in thin my gratitude 
a thin the only return i can make you 
became your merit cried out upon myself i have been trying to do it army 
the tenderest careuea followed this confession 
in inch 3 frame of mind be was now in elinor had no difficult in obtaining from her whatever profile she required 3 and at her request marianne engaged never to peak of the affair to any one with the lean appear~ once of bitterness 
— to meet lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her 
— and even to ice edward himself if chance should bring them together without any diminution of her usual cordiality 
theme were great concessions but where marianne felt that the sense and senshihjty 
so had injured no preparations could be too much for her to make 
she performed her promise of being discreetto admiration 
shentten to all that mr jennings had to say upon the object with an unchanging complexion dispersed from her in nothing and was heard three times to say yes madam she listened to her praise of lucy with only moving from one chair to another and when mrs jennings talked of edward’s affection it cost her only a pass in her throat such advances towards heroism in her time made elinor feel equal to anything herself 
the next morning brought a farther trial of it in a visit from their brother who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful affair and bring them new of his wife 
i 2 i a you have heard suppoae 3 said he with solemnity as soon as he was seated “of thesvleury‘ shocking dilcowry that took place under our roof yesterday 
they all looked their went 
it seemed too awful a moment for speech 
a your sister a he continued a heap eulfcred dreadfully 
mrs ferraro too 
in short it his been a scene of such complicated distresa 
but i will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of in quite overcome 
poor fanny 
she was in hysterics all emerday 
but i would not alarm you too much 
many says there is nothing materially to be apprehended 
her constitution in a good one and her resolution equal to anything 
she has home it all with the fortitude of an angel 
she says she never shall think well of anybody again 
and one can not wonder at it after being so deceived l 
morning with each ingratitude where so much kindness had been shown so much confidence had been placed 
it was quite out of 24 sense and sbnsibili‘i‘v 
the benevolence of her heart that she had already there young women to her house 
merely became she thought they deserved some attention were harmleu wellhehaved girls and would be pleasant companions 
for otherwite we both wished very much to large invited you and marianne to he with or while your kind friend there we attending her daughter 
and now be no ’ rewarded 
i with with all my heart 2 lye poor fanny in her affectionate way a that had indeed your sisters instead of there a here he stopped to be thanked 
which being done he went on 
that poor mrs ferraro suffer when in fanny broke it to her in not to be described 
while the with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connexion for him was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person i 
such a suspicion could never have entered her head i if the sun led an reputation where it could not be in ii quartet 6 the to he sure ’ laid the i might have thought myself safe she war quite in en agou 
we consulted together however as to what should d be done and at last the determined to lend for edward 
he came 
but i am sorry to relate what ensued 
all that mrs ferraro could by to make him put an end to the engagement assisted too at you may well suppose 
by my argument and fanny entreotiee was of no avail 
duty nﬂ‘eetion everything war dieregarded 
i never thought edward to etubborn so unfeeling before 
his mother explained to him her liberal designs in case of his marrying miss barton 
told him the would settle on him the norfolk state which clear of land-tax being in a good should appear 
oﬁ'eted even when matter grew deeper to make it.twelve hundred 
and in opposition to this if he still perceived in thin low connexion requested to him sense and sensible 
so 
the certain penury that must attend the match 
his own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all 
she would never see him again 5 and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance that if he were enter into any profession with a view of better support she would do all in her power to prevent his advancing in it here marianne in an ecstasy of indignation slipped her hands together and cried a gracious good an this be possible 7 a well may you wonder marianne replied her brother a at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these 
your exclamation is very natural 
marianne was going to retort but she remembered her promises and forbore 
all this however he continued a was urged in vain 
edward said very little 
but what he did say was in the most determined manner 
nothing could prevail on him to give up his engagement 
he would stand to it coat him what it right a then cried mrs jennings with blunt sincerity no longer able to be silent 4 he has acted like an honest man 
i beg your pardon mr dashwood but if he had done otherwise i should have thought him a musical 
i have some little concern in the business as well as yourself for lucy steele is my cousin and i believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world nor one who more deserves a good husband 
john dashwood was greatly astonished 
but his nature was calm not open to provocation and he never wished to offend anybod especially anybody of good fortune 
he therefore rep end without any resentment 
a a i would by no means a it disrespectfully of any relation of yours madam 
m lucy steele ii i dare say a very deserving young woman but in the present case you know the connexions must be impossible 
and is sense and sensibility 
have entered iritouecretengagemtwith nymg ’ man under her uncle care the son of a woman copedally of such very large fortune on mr ferraro isperhapl altogether a little extraordinary 
in short i do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of m whom you have a regard for my jennings 
e all wish her extreme happy and mr ferrars’a conduct throughout the who has been such an every conscientioul good mother in like circumstances would adopt it had been dignity and liberal 
edward has drawn his own lot and i fear it will be i bad one marianne sighed out her eimilar a rehension 
and elinor’s heart wrong for the feelings of edward while having his mother threats or a woman who could not reward him 
a well sir a laid mr jennings and how did it end 2 7 i am sorry to my ma'am in a most unhappy rupture 
edward is dismissed for ever from his mother s 4 
notice 
he left her home yesterday but where he is one or whether he is still in town i do not know 
or we of course can make no inquiry 
a poor young man 
and what is to become of him in a what indeed madam 
it it a melancholy consideration 
born to the prospect of such nﬂiuencel i can not conceive a situation more deplorable 
the interest of two thousand pounds 
how can a man live on it 
— and when to that is added the recollection that he might but for his own folly within three months have been in receipt of two thousand over hundred year for miss barton has thirty thousand pounds i can not picture to myself a more wretched condition 
we must all feel for him 
and the more no because it is totally out of our power to artist him a poor young man i 
cried mr jennings a i am sure he should he very welcome to bed and board at my sense and sensibility 
103 house 
and i would tell him if could see him 
it it not at that he should be living about at his own charge now at lodging and seven 
elinor'e heart thanked her for such kindness towards edward though she could not bear smiling at the form of it 
a if he would only have done at well by herself a laid john dashwood us all his friends were disposed do him might now have been in hit proper situation and would have wanted for nothing 
but i it it it must be out of anybody power to push him 
and there ll one thing more reparing against him which must be worse than all in mother had determined with a very natural kind of spirit to settle that estate a robert immediately which might have been edwardiani on proper condition 
1 left her this morning with her lawyer talking over the business 
a well i 3 said mr jennings 
that is bar revenge 
a emybod he a way of their own 
but i doubt think ’rnine you be to make one son independent become another had plagued me marianne got up and walked about the room 
can anything be more talking to the spirits of a man a continued john than to see all danger brother in possession of an estate which might t have been his own 
poor edward i feel for him tinoerely 
a few minute 
more spent in the lame kind of definition concluded his visit 
and with repeated auunneee on his litterthat he really believed there wan no material danger in fanny disposition and that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it he went away 
leaving the three ladies unanimoul in their sentiments on the present occasion at far at least as it regarded mn femn’a conduct 
the dashwooda’ and edward’s 
marinnne’t indignation burst forth as noon at he 104 sense and sensibility 
quittcdthe room 
and uhervehemeneemade reeerve impossible in elinor and unneoemry in my jennings 
they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party 
charm new” 
mrs jennings was very warm in her price of edward conduct but only elinor and marianne understood it true merit 
734 only knew how little he had had to tempt him m be dioobedient and how small war the consolation beyond the coneciouaneta of doing right that could remain to him in the score of friends and fortune 
elinor gloried in his integrity 
and marianne forgave all his offence in companion for his punishment 
but though conference between them me by this public diecovery letters to it proper state it was not a subject on which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone 
elinor avoid it upon principle an tending to fix still more upon her though by the too warm too positive assurances of 7 marianne that belief of edward i continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away 
and marianne courage soon failed her in trying to converse upon a topic which always left her more diautieﬁed with herself than ever by the compel-icon it necessarily produced between elinor conduct and her own 
she felt all the force of that comparison 
but not at her sister had hoped to urge her to exertion now 
the felt it with all the pain of continual elf-reproach regretted most bitterly that the had never exerted herself before 
but it brought only the torture of penitence without the hope of amendment 
her mind wan so much weakened that the still fancied preeent exercise and sensibility 
105 not impossible and therefore it only dispirited her more 
nothing new was heard by them for s d or two afterwards of affairs in harley-meet or ardett’s buildings 
but though so much of the matter was known to them already that mrs jennings might have had enough to do in reading that knowledge farther without seeking after more she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousin as soon as she could 
and nothing but the hindrance of more visits than usual had prevented her going to them within that time 
the third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars was so one so beautiful a sunday as to draw many to kensin ton gardens though it was only the second week in arch 
mrs jennings and elinor were of the number 
but marianne who knew that the willoughby were again in town and had a constant dread of meeting them chose rather to stay at home than venture into no public a place 
an intimate acquaintance of mrs jennings oinl-d them soon after they entered the gardens and eleanor was not so 
i that by her continuing with them and engage in all as jennings’s conversation she was herself left to quiet reflection 
she saw nothing of the willoughby nothing of edward and for some time nothing of anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay be interesting to her 
but at last she found herself with some surprise accosted by miss steele who though looking rather shy expressed great satisfaction in meeting them and on receiving eneoura e met from the particular kindness of mrs ennings s her own party for a short time to join theirs 
mrs jennings immediately whispered to elinor 
“getitallout of her my dear 
she will tell nothing you ask 
you see can not leave mrs larke.” 10 sense and sensibility 
it wan lucky however for mr jenninge’l curioity sud elinor’s too that the would tell anything without being asked for nothing would otherwise have been learnt 
i am to ghd w see you a said miss steele taking her familiarly by the arm a for i wanted to ice you of all things in the world 
and then lowering her voice a i suppose mrs jennings has heard all about it 
it she angry 
7 a not at all i believe with you 
a that in a good thing 
and lady middleton in :5 angry 
i can not suppose it be that she ihould 
a i am monstrous glad of it 
goodgﬂcioulld have had such a time of it 
i never saw luck in such a rage in my life 
she vowed at first the would never trim me up a new bonnet nor do anything else for me again i long as she lived 
but now she is quite come to and we are as good friend an ever 
look she made me this bow to my hat and put in the feather last night 
there now you are going to laugh at me too 
but why ihould not i wear pink ribbon 
i do not care if it i the doctor favourite colour 
i am sure for my part i should never have known he did like it better than any other colour if he had not happened to say 
so 
my cousins have been no plaguing me 
i declare eometirnel 
i do not know which way to look before them 
she had wandered away to a subject on which elinor had nothing to my and therefore noon judged it expedient to and her way back again to the first 
a well but miss dashwood speaking triurn hantly people may say what they chose about mr erran’t declaring he would not have lucy for it be no such a thing i can tell you 
and it is quite a home for such ill-natured reports to be spread abroad 
whatever lucy might think about it herself you know it was no business of other people to set it down for certain 
sense and sensxbili‘i'v 
of a i never heard anything of the kind hinted at before i assure on said elinor 
both did not you 
but it war said i know very well and by more than one 
for miss godby told miss park that nobody in their senses could expect mr fears to give up a woman like miss barton with thirty thousand pen to her fortune by lucy steele that had nothing at all 
and i had it from miss sparks myself 
and besides that my cousin richard laid himself that when it came to the point he was afraid mr ferraro would be off 
and when edward did not come near mrs for three days i could not tell what to think myself 
and i believe in my heart lucy gave it all up for lost 
for we came away from your brother's w stay and we saw nothing of him not all thursday friday and saturday and did not know what was become with him 
once lucy who but to write to him but then her spirit rose against that 
however this morning he came just as we came home from church 
and then it all came out how he had been sent for wednesday to harley-street and been talked to by his mother and all of them and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but lucy and nobody but lucy’would he have 
and how he had been so worried by what passed that as soon as he had went away from his mother s house he had got upon 1 his horse and rid into the country somewhere or other 
and how he had staid about at an inn all thursday and friday on purpose to get the better of it 
and after thinking it all over and over again he said it seemed to him as if now he had no fortune and no nothing at all it would be quite unkind to m her on to the engagement because it must be for her on for he had nothing but two thousand pounds and no hope of anything else 
and if he was to go into orders as he had some thoughts he could get nothing but a curacy and how was they 18 sense and sensibility 
to live upon that 
— he could not bear to think of her doing no better and so he begged if the had the least mind or it to at an end to the matter directly and leave him to she for himself 
i heard him say all thin as plain as could possibly be 
and it was entirely for mr sake and upon bar account that he laid a word about being off and not in a his own 
i will take my oath he never dropt a style able of being tired of her or of wishing to marry miss barton or anything like it 
but to be sure lucy would not have ear to such kind of talking 
so she told him directly my with a great deal about sweet and love you know and all that 
oh in 
one can repeat such kind of things you know 
— she told him directly the had not the least mind in the world to be off for she could live with him upon such a trifle and how little over he might have she should be very glad to have it all you know or something of the kind 
so then he was monstrous ha by and led on some time about what the should do and they agreed he should take orders directly and they must wait to be married till he got a living 
and not then i could not hear any more for my cousin ca end from below to tell me mrs richardson was come in her coach and would take one of us to kentington gardens 
so i was forced to go into the room and interest them to ask lucy if she would like to go but she did not care to leave ltdward 
to i just run spring and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the richardsons.” a i do not understand what you mean by interrupting them said elinor 
a you were all in the same room together were not you i 
a no indeed 
not us 
la 
miss dashwood do you think people make love when anybody else is by 
oh 
for shame 
— to be sure you must know better than that 
laughing affectedly 
— no no 
they were sense and sensibility 
109 shut up in the drawing-room together and all i heard was only by listening at the door a how i a cried elinor 
a have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door 
i am sorry did not know it before 
for i certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself 
how could you behave so unfairly by your sister 
a mob la 
there is nothing in i54 
i only stood at the door and heard what ihould 
and am sure lucy would have done us the same by me 
for a year or two back when artha sha and i had on many oeerets together she never man any bones of hiding in s closet 
or behind i chimney-board on to hear what we say a line tried to talk of something else 
but miss steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minute 
from what was uppermost in her mind 
a edward talks of going to oxford soon a said she a but now he is lodging at no 
— 
pass all 
what an ill-natured woman his mother is a n't shot and your brother and sister were not very kind however i shan’t say anything against them to you and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot which was more than i looked for 
and for my part i was all in fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before 
but however nothing was said about them and i took care to keep mine out of sight 
edward have got some bun 
news at oxford he says so he must go there for a time and after that as soon as he erm light upon a bishop he will be ordained 
i wonder what curacy he will get l 
good gracious 
g'ggling as she spoke i d lay my life i know what in cousins will say when they hear of it 
they will tell me i should write to the how sense and sensibility 
doctor to get edward the cure of his new living 
i know they will 
but i am cure would not do inch 8 thing for all the world 
— lal shall any directly a i wonder how you could think of such a thing 
i write uniiuthedoctor indeed 
s a well a said elinor 
it is a comfort to be prepsar‘ed’agninst the worn 
you have got your answer it my 
miss steele was going to reply on the same subject but the approach of her own party made another more necessary 
oh la 
here come the richard-om 
i had a vast deal more to say to you but i must not stay away from them not an longer 
i assure you they are very genteel people 
e makes a monstrous deal of money a and they keep their own coach 
i have not time to walk to mrs jennings about it myself but pray tell her am quite happy to hear she in not in anger against all and lady middleton the same 
and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away and mrs ennings ihould want company i am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes 
i suppose lady middleton wo n't ask iii any more thin but 
good-bye 
i am sorry miss marianne was not here 
remember me kindly to her 
la 
if you have not got your best spotted muslin onl 
i wonder you was not afraid omit being torn such was her parting concern 
for after thin the had time only to pay her farewell com limits to mrs jennings before her company was met by mrs rank and elinor was left in possession of knowledge which might feed her powers of detection some time though she had learnt v little more than what had been already foreseen andellhre-planned in her own mind 
edward’s marriage with lucy was i firmly determined on and the time of its taking place remained sense and sensibility 
la 3 s as absolutely uncertain as she had concluded it would be 
— everything depended exactly after her expectation on his stating that preferment of which at present there seem not the smallest chance 
as soon as they remained to the carriage mrs jennings was eager for information 
but a elinor wished to read as little as possible intelligence that had in the east place been so unfairly chained she contented herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars as she felt assured that lucy for the sake of her own consequence would chuse to have known 
the continuance of their engagement and the means that were to be taken for promoting its end was all her communication 
and this produced from mrs jennings the following natural remark 
wait for his having a living l 
ay we all know how that will end 
— 
the will wait a twelvemonth and ending no good comes of it will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds year with the interest of his two thousand pounds and what little matter mr steele and mr pratt can give her 
— then they will have a child every year and lord help feel how poor they will be 
i must see what i can give them towards furnishing their house 
two maids and two men indeed l 
as i talked of other day a no no they must get a. stout girl of all workm 
tty’s sister would never do for than new 
the next morning brought elinor a letter by the twopenny post from lucy herself 
it was as follows 
bunc-rr’s burmncs manly 
i hope my dear miss dashwood will excuse the liberty take of writing her but i know your friendship ormewillmake you pleatedwhearsuchs account of myself and my dear edward alter the trouble we have went through lately therefore will make i i 
sense and sensibility 
no more apologies but proceed to say that thank god 
thought have suffered dradﬁrlly we are both quite well now and as happy as we must always be in one anodrer’s love 
we have had great trials and great persecutions but however at the same time gratefully acknowledge many friends yourself not the least among them whose great kindness i shall always thankfully remember as will edward too who i have rid of it 
i am sure you will be glad to hear as likewise deaers jennings spent two happy flirts with him yesterday afternoon he would not hear of our parting though earnestly did i as i thought my duty required urge him to it for prudence sake and would have parted for 
ever on the spot would he consent to it 
but he said it should never be he did not regard his mother s anger while he could have my affections 
our prospects are not very bright to be sure but we must wait and for the best 
he will be ordained shortly and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to anybody that has a living to bestow am very.sure you will not forget us and dear mrs jennings too trust the will break a good word for us to sir john or mr palmer or any friend that may be able to assist us 
poor anne was much to blame for what she did but she did it for the best so i my nothing

as soon as elinor had wished it she performed what the concluded to be its writer real design by sense and sensibility 
3 placing it in the hand of mrjenninge who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and pride

he in duhwoode had now been rather more than two months in town and marimne’a in silence to be one increaaed every day 
she sighed m the air the i pity the quiet of the country 
and fancied that if anyplace could give her eye barton must do it 
elinor was hardly lean anxioul than herself for their removal and oh yes so much less bent on in being effected immediately at that the was conscious of the ‘ﬂicnltiet of so long a journey which marianne could not be brought to acknowledge 
she began however seriously to turn her thoughts toward it accom lament and had already mentioned their wishes their kind hoetese who reaitted them with all the eloquence of her good-will when a plan wan suggested which though detaining them from home yet i few weeks longer 
appeared w elinor altogether much more eligible than any other 
the painters were to remove to cleveland about the end of march for the ear ii 
he 
4 sense 
and sensibility 
holidays and mr jennings with both her friends received a very warm invitation from charlotte to go with them 
would not 
in itself have been sufficient for the delicacy of mine dashwood 
— 
hers it was enforced with so much real politeness by mr palmer himself an joined to the very great amendment of hit manners towards them since her inner had been known to be unhappy induced her to accept it with pleasure 
when the told marianne what the had done however her first reply was not very auspicious 
a cleveland 
’ 
she cried with great agitation 
a no i can not go to cleveland a you forget 7 aid elinor gently that its duration in not 
that it is not in the neighbourhood of 
a but it in in somcrcctrhirc 
— i not go into somerccuhirc 
— l‘hcrt, when i looked forward to going 
no elinor you can not expect me to go there elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming inch feelings 
— the only endeavoured to connect them by working on other 
— and represented it therefore an a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother whom the to much wished to see in a more eligible more comfortable manner than any other plan could do and perhaps without any greater delay 
me cleveland which was within a few mile of bristol the distance to barton was not beyond one day though a long day journey 
and their mother servant might eanl come there to attend them down 
and an there so d be no occasion for their mying above a week at cleveland they might now he at home in little more than three weeks time 
a marianne’s affection for her mother was sincere it must triumph with little difficulty over the imaginary evil the had tasted 
skins and snusmu’rv 
25 mrs jennings was so far from being weary of her guests that she missed them vary earnestly to return with her again in cleveland 
elinor us grateful for the attention but it could not alter their design 
and their mothers concurrence being radii everything relan veal to their return was an as far as it could be 
— and marianne found some rest of in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet in divide her born barton 
a as colonel i do not know what you and i shall do without the miss dashwood a 
was mrs jennings s address to him when he first called on her after their leaving her was settled 
— a for they are quite resolved upon omg home from the palmer 
— and how forlorn we shall be when i come back i 
lord 
we shall sit and peep at one another as dull as two cats 
perhaps is jennings was in hopes by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui to provoke him to make that offer which might give himself an escape from it 
and if so she had soon afterwards good reason to drink her object gained 
for on elinor’s moving to the window to me more ex ’tiously the dimensions of a hint which she was going to cox s for her friend he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning and conversed with her there for several minutes 
the effect of this discourse on the lady too could not escape her observation 
for though the w too honourable to listen and had even changed her seat on purpose that she i but not hear to one close by the pianoforte on which rinnne was playing she could not b herself from seeing that elinor changed colour atten end with agitation and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment 
still farther in confirmation of her in the interval of marianne’s turning from one lesson to another some words of the colonel inevitably reached her ear in which he seemed to be apologising by sense and sensibility 
for the hardness of his house 
this let the matter beyond a doubt 
she wondered indeed at his thinking it necessary to do no 
— but supposed it to be the paper etiquette 
what elinor said in reply the so d not diuingniah but just end from the motion of her lip 
that the did not think i i any material objection 
— and mrs jennings commended her ear her s being so honest 
they then talked on for few minutes longer without her catching a syllable when another lucky top in marianne’s performance brought her these words in the colonel m voice 
a i am afraid it can not take place very soon 
astonished and shocked at so unlover-like of speech she was almost ready to cry out a lord 
what should handed it 
— but checking her desire contented herself to thin silent ejaculation 
v a this ll very strange l 
in he need not wait to be ordered this delay on the colonel side however did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least 
for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards and moving different ways mr jennings very plainly heard elinor say and in a voice which showed her to feel what she said i shall always think myself very much obliged to on my mrs jennings was delighted with her gratitude and on 
wondered that after hearing such a sentence the so one should be able to take leave of them as he immediately did with the utmost sang-froid and go without making her any reply l 
she had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a sailor 
what had really paused between them was to this eli'ecb 
a s have heard said he with great companion a of the injustice your friend mr fears has suffered from sense and sensibility l 7 his family 3 for if i understand the matter right he has been entirely cast off by them for persevered in his engagement with a very deserving young woman 
— have i been rightly informed 
— 
is it so 
elinor told him that it was 
6 the cruelty the impolitic cruelty he replied with great feelin 
of dividing or attempting to divide two ng peop e long attached to each other is terrible 
few does not know what she may be doing 
what she may drive her son to 
i have seen mr ferraro two or three times in harley-street and am much pleased with him 
he is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in s short time but i have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake and as a friend of yours i wish it still more 
i understand that he intends to take orders 
will you be so good as to tell him that the living of delaford now just vacant as i am informed by this day post is his if he think it worth his acceptance 
— 
but dial perhaps so unfortunately circumstances as he is now it may be nonsense to appear to doubt 
i only wish it were more valuable 
— 
it is a rectory but a small one 
the late incumbent i believe did not make more than not unds per annum and though it is certainly capable of improvement i fear not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income 
such as it is however my lesson in present him to it will be very great 
ray assure him of it linor’s.asmnlshment at this commission could hardly have been greater had the colonel been really making her an offer of his hand 
the preferment which only two do s before she had considered as hopeless for edward was already provided to enable him to many 
— and the of all people in theory was fixed on to bestow it 
her emotion was such as mrs jennings had attributed to a very different cause g 
but whatever 18 sense and sensibili'i'y 
minor feelings less pure less pleasing might have a share in that emotion her esteem for the general benevolence and her gratitude for the vulgar friendship which together rompted colonel brandon to this act were strongly all and warmly expressed 
she thanked him for it with all her hem spoke of edward’s principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure if it were really his wish to put on no agreeable on voice to no e 
but at the same time she could not help than that no one could so well perform it at himself 
t was an office in short from which unwilling to give edward the pain of receiving an obligation from her the would have been very glad to be spared herself 
— but colonel brandon on motives of equal delicac declining it likewise still seemed so desirous of its ng given through her means that she would not on any account make farther on position 
edward she believed was still in town an fortunately she had heard his address from miss steele 
she could undertake therefore to inform him of it in the course of the day 
after this had been settled colonel brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour 
and terms it was that he mentioned with regret that the house was small and indifferent 
— an evil which elinor as mrs jennings had supposed her to do made very light of at least as far as regarded its size 
the smallness of the house said the a i can not imagine my inconvenience to them for it will be in proof action to their family and income 
my which the colonel was surprised to and that be was considering their mania e an the certain consequence of the presentation 
or he did not suppose it possible that elaford living could supply such an y‘ansr 
and snusrnxu-rv 
19 income as anne in their style of life would permit to settle on 
and e did so 
this little rectory can do no more than make mr ferraro comfortable is a bachelor 
it can not enable him to marry 
i am sorry to my that my patronage end with thin 
and my interest is hardly more extent we 
if however by any unforeeeen chance it should be in my power to serve him further i must think very differently of him from what now do if rain not ureadyta useful to him then sincerely wish i could beat present 
what i urn now doing indeed seems nothing at ill since it can advance him no little toward what must be his principal his only object of happy 
new 
his marriage must still be a direct good 
— at east i am afraid it can not take place very soon much was the entrance which when misunderstood so justly offended the delicate feeling of mrs jennings 
but after this narration of what really passed between colonel brandon and elinor while they stood at the window the gratitude expected by the latter on their parting may perhaps appear in general not let reasonably excited nor less properly worded than if it and driven from an offer of marriage 
chuse it 
’ 
all in duhw 
said mr jennings ugaciously smiling as loan as the ten man had withdrawn i do not ask you what the colonel ha 
been trying to you 
for though upon my honour i .triedto keep out of hearing i could not help catching enough to understand his business 
and i more you i never wan better 20 sense and sensibility 
placed in my life and i will you joy of it with all my heart a thank you ma'am aid elinor 
a it i i matter of great joy to me 
and i feel the goodness of colonel brandon moat sentibly 
there are not many men who would act as he has done 
few people have to comfort a heart 
i never was more astonished in my life “lord 
my dear you are very modest 
i on the lean astonished at it in the word d for i have often thought of late 
there was nothing more likely to happen 
a you judged from your knowledge of the colonel general benevolence 
but at lean you could not foresee that the oppommit would so very noon occur a lsiportunity 
1 repeated mrs jennings 
a oh 
25 to at when a man ha 
once made up his mind in we a thing oonxchow or other he will soon and an opportunity 
well my dear i with you joy of it again and again 
and if ever there war a happy couple in the world i think i shall won know where to look for them 
a you mean on go to delaford after them i suppose said elinor with a faint smile 
aye my dear that i do indeed 
and up to the house being a bad one i do not know what the colonel would be at for it in as good a one as ever i saw a he kept omit being out of or “wellzmand whose fault is that 
why do n't he repair it up 
who could do it but himself 
a they were interrupted by the servants coming in to announce the carriage being at the door 
and mr jennings immediate preparing to go laid 
well my dear must be gone before i have had half my talk out 
but however we may have it all sense and sensibility 
12 
over in the evening for we shall be quite alone 
i do not why you to go with me for i dare lay your mind in too full of the matter to care for company 
and besides you must long to tell your exeter all about it begmarianne had left the room before the conversation an 
a certainly ma'am i shall tell marianne of it 
but i shall not mention it at present to anybody else a oh s very well mind my jennings rather disappointed 
a then you would not have me tell it lucy for i think of going as far at holbom 00-day.” no ma'am not even lucy if you please 
one day delay will not he very material 
and till i have written to mr ferraro i think it ought not to be mentioned to anybody else 
i shall do be directly 
to of imgomce that no time should be lost with him for he will of count have much to do relative to his ordination this each at lint puzzled mr. jennings exceedingly 
yes mr ferraro was to be written to about it in such a hurry she could not immediately come rehend 
a few moments reflection however produced a very a happier and the exclaimed 
a his hold indeed you 
mr ferraro is to be the man 
well so much the better for him 
a to before he must be ordained in reading 
and am .verygladm and things are so forward between you 
but my dear in not thin rather out of character 
should not the colonel write'himeelf 
sure he in the s n. light dmt quite understand the beginning of mr jenninge’l lpeech 
neither did he think it worth inquiring into 
and therefore only replied to in conclurion 
a colonel brandon is so delicate a man that he rather wished any one to announce his intention to mr f errors than himself 122 sees 
and sensibility 
and so you are forced to do it 
well be is an odd kind of delicacy 
however i will not disturb or satin her ran to write 
you know an ooncerns 13 good-bye my dear 
i he 
not heard of anything to please me so well since charlotte was brought to bed 
and away she went but retuming again in a moment 
a i have been thinking of better sister my dear 
should be very glad to get her so good a mistress 
but whether she would do for a lady maid i am sure i can tell 
she is an excellent housemaid and works very well at her needle 
however you will think of all that at your leisure.” 
certainly ma'am 7 replied elinor not hearing much of what she said and more anxious to he alone than to he mistress of the subject how she should begin 
how she should express herself in her note to edward was now all her concern 
the particular circumstances between them made a dislike say of that which to any other person would have been the easiest thing in the world 
but she equally feared to say too much or too little and t deliberating over her paper with the no in her hand till broken in on the entrance of e ward himself 
e had met mrs .lennin s at the door in her way to the carriage us he came to cave his farewell curd 
and the after apologising for not returning herself had obliged him to enter his saying that miss dashwood was above and wan to speak with him on very particular business 
elinor had just been congratulating herself in the midst of her perplexity that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth when her visitor entered to force her upon this greatest sense and sensibility 
13 exertion of all 
her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance 
she had not seen him before since his engagement became public and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted with it 
which with the consciousness of 
what she had been thinking of and what she had to tell him made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes 
he too was much distressed and they sat down together in a most promising state of embarrassment 
whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming into the room he could not recollect 
but determining to he on the safe side he made his 2 long in form us soon as he could say anything other in no a chair 
a mrs jennings told me a said he a that you wished to speak with me at least i understood her so 
or i certainly should not have intended on you in such a manner 
though at the some time i should have been extremely sorry to leave london without seeing you and your sister 
especially as it will most likely be some time 
it is not probable that i should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again 
i go to oxford tomarrow 
a you would not have gone however said elinor recovering herself and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible 7 without receiving in our good wishes even if we had not been able to give them in person 
mrs jennings was quite right in what she said 
i have something of consequence to inform you of which i was on the point of communicating by paper 
i am charged with a most agreeable office breathing rather faster than usual on she spoke 
colonel brandon who was here only ten minutes ago has desired me to say that understanding you mean to take orders he has great pleasure in offering you the living of delaford now ust vacant and on wishes it were more valuable 
a w me to long you on 24 sense and sensibility 
having no respectable and well-judging a friend and to join in he with that the living 
it up about two hundred year 
were much more considerable and such as might better enable you w 
a might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself 
much in short a might establish ill your views of happiness 
what edward felt no he could not any it herself it can not be expected that any one else ihould lay it for him 
he noted all the astonishment which each unexpected which such unthought-of inforrnan'on could not fail of exciting 
but he said only these two words 
a colonel rundon 
7 a year a continued elinor gathering more renolution 
a tone of the worst was over 
colonel brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately for the cruel situation in which the injustice lc conduct of your family has placed you 
a concern which i am cure marianne myself and ill your friend 
must share 
and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character and his part as approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion 
colonel brandon give me a living 
— can it he 
the unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to and friendship anywhere.” a no a replied he with in ten conscioulness not to and it in you for i can not be ignorant that to you to your goodness i owe it all 
i feel it 
would expose it if i could 
but as you well know i am no orator.” a you are very much mistaken 
i do nature you that you owe it entirely at least almost entirely to your own merit and colonel brandon’s discernment of it 
i have had no hand in it 
i did not even know till i understood his design that the living was vacant 
nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have inch 3 living in sense and sehsmlity 
as his as a friend ofmine ofmyfsrnil hemay amps 
indeed i know he but still greater p ensure in throwing it 
but upon my word you owe nothing to my solicitation 
truth obliged her to acknowledge some mull share in the action 
but she was it the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefach’ess of edward that she acknowledged it with hesitation 
which probably contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it 
for a short time he sat deep in thought after elinor had ceased to speak 
at last as if it were rather an effort he said 
a colonel brandon seems a man of great worth and tability 
i have always heard him spoken of as mr and your brother i know esteems him highly 
he is undoubtedly a sensible man and in his manners perfectly the gentleman 
a indeed a replied elinor a i believe that you will find him on farther acquaintance all that you have heard him to be 
and a will be suchverynear neighbours for i understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion-house it is particular y important that he should be all this edward made no answer 
but when she had turned away her head gave her a look so serious so earnest so cheerful as seemed to say that he might hereafter with the distance between the parsonage the mansion-house much greater 
a colonel brandon i think lodges in st james'sstreet 3 said he soon afterwards rising from his chair 
elinor told him the number of the house 
i must hurry away then to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give you 
assured him first he has made me a very 
an exceedingly happy man 
elinor did not offer to detain him 
and they parted :26 says and snusxan-v 
withsveryeamestassuraneeon bersideof herunoeas 
in 
good wishes for his happiness in everything of situation that might befall him 
on in with rather an attempt to return the me good-will than the power of expressing it 
a when i see him again said elinor to herself is the door shut him out i shall see him the husband of lucy 
and with this pleasing anticipation she sat down to consider the the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of edward 
and of course to reflect on her own with discontent 
when mrs jennings came home though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before and of whom therefore she must have a gun deal to say her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession than by anything else that she reverted to it again as soon as elinor appeared 
well my dear a she cried i sent us up the young man 
did not i do right a 
an i suppose you had no great dilliculty 
— you did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal 21 a no ma'am 
that was not very likely well and how soon will he be ready i 
for it seems all to depend upon that a 
really did elinor i know so little of these kind of forms 
that i can hardly even conjecture as to the time or the preparation necessary 
but i suppose two or three months will complete his ordimtion.’ a two or three months 
a cried mr jennings 
a lord 
my dear how calmly you talk of it and can the colonel wait two or three months 
lord bless me 
— i am sure it would at me quite out of patience 
— and though one would very glad to do a kindness by poor mr f errand i do think it is not word while to wait two or three months for him 
sure somebody sense and sensibility 
v 127 else might be found that would do s well 
somebody that is in order as my 
a my dear madam 3 said elinor what can you be that of i 
why colonel brandon’s only object is to be use to mr ferraro 
a lord bless you my dear l. sure you do not mean to persuade me that the colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to mr fears 6 the deception could not continue after this 
and an explanation immediately took place by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment without an material loss of ha less to either for mrs jennings mexchnngcd one arm of delight for another and without forgetting her expectation of the list 
aye aye the age is but a-unall one said she after the first em 
of surprise and satisfaction was over and very likely may be out of repair 
but to hat a man a lodgings as i thought for house that to my knowl ge has ever sitting-rooms on the groundlloor and i think the horse s told me could make upﬁfteen bedsl 
and to you to that had been used to live in barton cottage 
it secde quite ridiculous 
— but my clear we must touch up the colonel to do something to the parsonage and make it comfortable for them before lucy goes to it but colonel brandon does not seem to have any a ideas of the living being enough to allow them to i 
e colonel to i fanny my dear 
because he has two thousand appear himself he thinks that nobody else can many on la 
take my word for it that if i am alive i shall be paying a visit at delaford parsonage before michaelmas 
and i am sure i shan’t go if lucy en’t there 
e nor was quite out of her opinion no to the proof abilities of their not waiting for anything more

chapter 1 
towards having married hit thanks to colonel brandon proceeded with his next to lucy 
and such war the excess of it s the time he reached bartlen’t buildingt 
that the was able to nature on jennings who called on her again the next day with her congratulations that the had never seen him in such spirit before in her life 
her own happiness and her own spirit were at least very certain 
and the pointed mrs jennings most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in delaford parsonage before michaelmas so far was the at the tame time from any hackwardnett to give elinor that credit which edward would give her that the spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth was ready to own all that obligation to her and openly declared that no exertion for their good on miss dashwood s it either present or future would ever surprise her or the believed her capable of doing anything in the world for those the really valued 
as for colonel brandon the was not only ready to worship him at a faint but was moreover tnin anxious that he should be treated at one in all worldly concerns 
anxious that his tithes should be raised to the moon 
and secretly resolved to avail herself at delaford as far as the post could of hit tervanu his carriage his cows and hit poult 
it was now above a week since john match had called in berkeley-street and at since that time no notice had been taken by them of his wife indispoaition beyond one verbal inqui elinor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit 
— his was an obligation however which not only opposed her own inclination but which had not the assistance of any encouragement sense and sensibility 
29 from her companions 
marianne not contented with aboolutel refusing to go herself was very urgent to prevent her sisters going at all 
and mrs jennings though her carriage was always 
at elinor’s service so very much disliked mr john aehwood that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery nor her strong desire to affront her by taking edward’s part could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again 
the consequence was that elinor set out by herself to pay a visit for which no one could really have less inclination and to run the risk of a téteeis-téu with a woman whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike 
mr 
duhwood was denied 
but before the carriage could turn from the house her husband accidents y 
came out 
he expressed great pleasure in meeting elinor told her that he had been going to all in berkeley-street and assuring her that fanny would be glad to lee her invited her to come in hey walked up stain into the drawing-room 
nobody was there 
a fanny is in her own room i suppose a said he 
— a i will go to her presently for i am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing you 
very far from it indeed 
now especially there can not be 
but however on and marianne were any great favourite 
by would not marianne come 
a elinor made whet excuse she could for her 
a i am not sorry to ice you alone 4 he replied a for ihaveagooddealtosaytoyou 
thislivingof colonel brandon’hnn it be two s 
has he really given it to edward s 
i heard it yesterday by chance and was coming to you on purpose to inquire farther but it a it in july true 
— colonel brandon has given the living of hold to edward ii 
i 30 sense and sensibility 
a really ll 
well this is very astonishing 
— 
no relationship l 
no connexion between them 1 
end now that livings fetch such a price s 
what was the value of this ll a about two hundred a 
year 
a very well 
and for the next pretensions to a living of that value 
m passing the late incumbent to have been old and since my and like to vacate it soon 
he might have got i dare say 
urteen hundred pounds 
and how came he not to have settled that matter before this person’s death i 
now indeed it would be too late to sell it but a man of colonel brandon’s sense 
— i wonder he should be so improvements in a point of such common such nature concern 
— 
well i am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human chsmcter 
i suppose however 
in recollection 
— that the case may probably be his 
edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the colonel has really sold the presentation is old enough to take it 
— 
e aye that is the fact depend upon it 
e itor contradicted it however very positively 
and by relating that she had herself been emplo end in conveying the offer from colonel brandon to ward and to me must understand the terms on which it was given obliged him to submit to her authority 
a it is truly astonishing 
— he cried after what she said 
a what could be the colonel motive 
a very simple one 
to be use to mr fan 
well well 
whatever colonel brandon may be edward is a very lucky man 
you will not mention the matter to fanny however 
for though i have broke it to her and she it mtly well she will not like to hear it much talked of 
elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing that the thought fanny might have home with composure an acquisition of wealth to her brother sense and sensibility 
13 
by which neither the nor her child could be poring impoveriahed 
a mrs ferraro a added he lowering his voice to the tone becoming so important a a know 
nothing about it at present and i believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long an my be 
— when the marriage takes place i fear she must hear of it all 
a but why should such precaution be used i 
though it is not to supposed that mrs fenars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son hate money enough to live upon 
— for but must be quite out of the question 
yet who after her late behaviour is she supposed to feel at all 
he has done with her son she hasput him of 
for ever and has made all those over whom she had any influence cast him off likewise surely aﬁer doing on she can not be imagined liable to any impression of form or of joy on his account 
she can not be interested in anything that befall him 
she would not be an weak as to throw away the comfort of a child and retain the anxiety of a parent 
7 a as elinor said john “your reasoning is very but it is founded on ignorance of human nature 
hen edward’s unha match takes place depend upon it his mother will else as much as if she had never discerned him 
and therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event 
must be concealed from her on much as possible 
mrs fear can never forget that edward in her in 
you surprise me 
i could think it must nearly have escaped her memory by by time 
you wrong her exceedingly 
mrs fear is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world a elinor was silent 
a we think am a said mr dashwood after a short pause a of robert marrying miss morton.” 12 sense and sensibility 
elinor milling at the grave and deceived importance of her brothers tone calmly replied

“choice l 
how do a mean t a i only mean that purpose from your manner of taking it must be the lame to mill barton whether an marry edward or robert certainly there can be no dill'crcncc 
for robert will now to all interests and yurpoeee be considered an the eldest son 
and an to anything else they are both very agreeable young men 
i do not know that one in superior to the other elinor said no more and john was also for a than time silent 
his relations ended that 
of one thing my dear sister a kindly taking her hand and taking in an awful chapter 5 i may assure you and will do it because i know it must grant you 
i have good reason to think 
indeed i have it from the heat authority or i should not repeat it for otherwise it would be very wrong to say anything about it 
but i have from the very heat authority 
not that i ever precisely heard mi'i ferraro lay it herself but her daughter sad and i have it from her 
that in short whatever objection 
there might be against a certain 
a certain connexion 
you understand rue 
it would have been far preferable to her it would not have her half the vexation that ill duet 
i wan exceedingly pleased to hear that mr f mare considered it in that light 
4 very gratifying circurmtance you know to up all 
a it would have been beyond comparison 4 he aid he lean evil of the two and she would be glad to company now for nothing woman but however all that in quite out of the question 
not to be thought of or mentioned 
an to any attachment you know 
it never could he 
all that a gone by 
but i thought i would just tell you of this became i knew how much sense and sensibility 
33 it must please you 
not that you have any son to regret my dear elinor 
there is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well 
quite as well or better perhaps all thin i considered 
has colonel brandon been with you la yes i elinor had heard enough if not to gratify her vanity and raised her self-importance to agitate her nerves and all her mind 
and she was therefore glad to be red from the necessity of saying much in reply herself and from the danger of hearing anything more from her brother by the entrance of mr robert ferraro 
after a few moments chnt john dashwood recollecting that fanny was yet uninformed of his sister being there quitted the room in nest of her 
and elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with robert who by the gay unconcern the ha by self-complacency of his manner while enjoying so a air a division of his mother s love and liberality to the prejudice of his banished brother earned only by his own dissipated course of life and that brother's integrity was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart they had scarcely been two minutes by themselves before he began to speak of edward 
for he too had heard of the living and was very inquisitive on the subject 
elinor repeated the particular of it as she had given them to john and their effect on robert though very different was not less striking than it had been on bins 
he laughed moat immoderately 
the idea of edward’s begin a clergyman and living in a small parsonage-house iverted him beyond measure 
and when to that was added the fanciful images of edward reading eyes in a white surprise and pushing the basis of marriage between john smith and mary brown he could conceive nothing more ridiculous 
elinor while she waited in silence and immovable gravity the conclusion of such folly could not remain 24 sense and seisibilh'v 
her eyelfrom being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited 
it war a look however very well bestowed far it relieved her own feelingnand gave no intelligence to him 
he was recalled from wit to wild not by any reproofof hen but by his 
own ieueibility 
we may treat it as a joke said he at but recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment 
a but a no my soul it is a most serious buaineu

for i know him to be a very good-hearted creature

but though :5 never spoke of it out of her own family elinor could lee its influence on her mind in the something like confusion of countenance with which she entered and an attempt at cordinlity in he behaviour to herself 
she even proceeded to fear a to be concerns to and that elinor and her anger wereloloonrolenvetown u|l elnrdh toeee more of them

than 13 no other short call in harley-meet in which elinor received her brothers congratulation 
on their tmvellin no fear towardr barton without any expense and on colonel brandon’s being to follow them to clare-land in a day or two completed the intercourse of the brother and like in town 
and a faint invitation from fanny to come to norland whenever it should happen to be in their way which of all thing war the most unlikely to occur with a more warm though less public assurance from john to elinor of the raw side with which he could come m in her at mr was all that foretold any meeting in the country 
it amused her to observe that all her friends leaned determined to send her to delaford 
a place in which fall others she would now least chuse to visit or wish to reside 
for not only was it considered on her future home by her brother and mr jennings but even lucy when they parted gave her a pmedng invitation to visit her there 
very early in april and tolerate early in the day the two parties from hanover-iquare and berkeleyrtreet act out from their respective hon-lea to meet by a intent on the road 
for the convenience of charlotte and her child they were to be more than two day on their journey and mr palmer travelling more ex tiously with colonel brandon wan to join them at leveland noon after their arrival 
marianne few a had been her hours of comfort in london and eager at the had long been to quit it could not 
when it came to the inn bid adieu to the house in which the had for the at time enjoyed those hopes and that conscience in willoughby which were sense and sensibility 
27 now extinguished for ever without great pain 
nor could she leave the place in which willoughby remained in new engagements and new schemes in which a could have no share 
without shedding man tears 
linor’s satisfaction at the moment of removal was more positive 
she had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on she left no creature behind from whom it would give her a moment's regret to be divided for ever she was pleased to be free herself from the mention of lucy’s friendship she was grateful for urging her sister away unseen by willoughby since his marriage and she looked forward with hope to what a few months of tranquillity at barton i but do towards restoring marianne’s peace of mind confirming her own 
their journey was safely performed 
the second day brought them into the cherished or the prohibited county of somerset for as such was it dwelt on by turns in marianne’s imagination 
and in the footman of the third they drove up to cleveland 
cleveland was a spacious modern-built house situated on a sloping lawn 
it had no park but the pleasuregmunds were tolerath extensive 
and like every other place of the same degree of importance it had its open shrubbery and closer wood-walk 
a road of smooth gravel winding round a sensation led to the front 
the lawn was posted over with timber 
the house itself was under the guardianship of the or the mountains and the apace and a duel screen of them altogether interspersed with tall lombardy poplars shut out the offices 
marianne entered the house with an heart swelling with emotion from the consciousness of being only i hty miles from barton and not thirty from some gun 
and before she had been ever minutes within its sense and senslbllitv 
its walls while the there were busily helping charlotte she her child to the housekeeper the quitted it stealing away through by the winding ihmbberiel now just beginning to be in duty to gain a time eminence 
where from its grecian temple her eye wandering over a wide me of country to the south-east could fondiy rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon and army that from their summons combo magoo might be seen 
in such moments of precious of invaluable she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at cleveland 
and as the returned by a different circuit to the house feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty of wandering from lace to place in free and luxurious solitude she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained with the palmer in the indulgence of such solitary rambles 
she returned just in time to join the other as they quitted the house on an excursion through its more immediate premises 
and the rent of the morning was easily whisked away in lounging round the kitchen garden examining the bloom upon its walls and listening to the gardener s lamentatiom upon blighn 
in dawdling through the greenhouse where the loss of her favourite lants unwarin exposed and sit by the lingering root raised the laughter of chat one all 
in visiting her poultry-yard where in the disappointed hopes of her dairymaid by hens fonalting their seats or being stolen by a for or in the rapid decease of a promising young brood she found fresh sources of merriment 
the morning was one and dry and marianne in her plan of employment abroad had not calculated ear an change of weather during their stay at cleveland 
with great surprise therefore did she and herself prevented by a settled rain from going out again after sznsrt run msrnru'n 
29 dinner 
she had depended on a twilight walk to the grecian temple and perhaps all over the grounds and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deserted her from it 
but a hen and settled rain even :17 could not fancy dry or peanut weather for walking 
their was small and the hour quietly away 
me palmer had her child and me inning her carpet-work 
they talked of the friends they had left behind arranged lad middleton’s en general i and wondered whether s palmer are 
la colonel brandon would get further than reading that night 
elinor however little concerned in it joined in their discourse and marianne who had the knack of finding her way in every house to the library however it might be avoided by the family in general soon procured heraelfa hook 
nothing was wanting on my palmer’a ride that constant and friendly good humour could do to malt 
them feel themselves welcome 
the ones and weariness of her manner more than acted or that want of recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms of politeness 
her kindness recommended by so pretty a face was engaging 
her folly though evident war not ditguating because it war not'conceited 
and elinor could have forgiven everything but 
her laugh 
he two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner affording a pleasant enlargement of the party and a very welcome variety to their conversation which along morning of the time continued rain had reduced very low 
elinor had soon so little of mr palmer and in that little had been such variety in his address to herriater' and herself that she knew not what to expect to find him in in own family 
she found him however per140 sense and sensible 
exactly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitor and only occasionally made to his wife and her mother 
she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion and only prevented from being so always by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people in general as he must feel himself to be to me jennings and charlotte 
for the nest of his character and habits they were marked as far as elinor could receive with no traits at all unusual in his sex an time of life 
he was nice in his eating uncertain in his hours 
fond of his child though affecting to slight it 
and died away the mornings at billiards which ought to have been devoted to business 
she liked him however a no the whole 
much better than she had expected an in her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more 
not sorry to be driven b the observation of his cpicurism his selﬁshness an his conceit to rest with complacency on the remembrance of edward’s generous temper limple taste and diffident feelings 
of edward or at least of some of his concerns the now received intelligence from colonel brandon who had been into donetshire lately 
and who treating her at once as the interest friend of mr ferraro and the kind confidante of himself talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at delaford described its deﬁciencies and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them 
his behaviour table in this as well as in every other particular 
his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days his reading to converse with her and his deference for her opinion might very well justify mrs jenningl’r persuasion of his attachment and would have been enough perhaps had not elinor still as from the first believed arisen his real favourite to make her suspect it herself

a very reduced fevetinh night however die 
a pointed the expectation of both 
when after persisting in rising conith henelf unable to ii 
up and returned voluntarilyto her bed elinor was very ready to adopt mn jenningt’l advice of ending for the payment apothecary 
he came examined hit patient and though encouraging mist dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore her lines to health yet by pronouncing her dinorderto have a putrid tendency and allow the word 
ink-coon to pay his lips gave irritant raglan“ to mr palmer on her baby account 
mr jennings who had been inclined from the first to think muimne’t complaint more serious than elinor now looked very g on mr harris’l report and conﬁrming charlotte a and caution opposed the necessity of her immediate removal with her in not 5 and mr palmer though treating their npprehcmionl an idle found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to beviithitood 
her departure therefore war fixed on 
and within on hour after mr harrii’i arrival she set off with her little boy and his purse for the house of a near relation of mr palmer’s 
who lived a few mile 
on the other tide of bath 
whither her husband provided at her earnest entirely to join her in a day or two 
and whither the war almost equally urgent with her mother to accomsense and sensxbihtv 
.143 yet her 
mrs jennings however with a kindness of in which made elinor rally love her declared her resolution of not rising from cleveland an long in marianne remained ill. and of endeavouring by her own attentive can 
to cup lay to her the lace of the mother the had taken her m 
and elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active he made doaimua to there in all her fatigue and often her better ex nice in nursing of material une 
poor etienne sanguine and low from the nature of her malady and feeling herself universally ill could no longer how that to-morrow would send her recovered 
and their ease of what to-morrow would have produced but for this unlucky illneu made every almost more severe 
for on that day they were to have begun their journey home and attended the whole way by a servant of mr jennings were to have taken their mother by in rise on the following forenoon 
the little that she said wan all in lamentations of thin inevitable delay 
though elinor tried to nine her spirits and make her believe as the the really believed herself that it would be a very short one 
the next day produced little or no alteration in the acts of the patient 
she remains was not better and except that there wan no among men did not a worse 
their party was now ﬁrther reduced 
for mr palmer though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good-nature as from a dislike of appearing in to be frightened away by hill wife was persuaded at last by colonel brandon to perform his promise of 7 following her 
and while he viu preparing to go colonel brandon himself with i much greater exertion be to talk of going likewite

especially as mrs jenningt’t entreny wan warmly seconded by mr palmer who seemed to feel a relief to himself in leaving behind him a person to well able to assist or advise mine dashwood in any emergence 
marianne war of course kept in ignorance of all'theee arrangements 
she knew not that she had been the means of sending the owner of cleveland away 
in about seven days from the time of their arrival 
it gave her no surprise that the law nothing of mr palmer 
and as it gave her likewise no concern the never mentioned her name 
two days passed away from the time of mr palmer departure an her situation continued with little variation the name 
mr harriet who attended her day still talked hold of a speedy recovery and in blood was equally sanguine 
but the expectation of the others was by no mean so cheerful 
mr jennings had determined very early in the seizure that marianne would never get over it and colonel brandon who wan chief of use in listening to mr jenninga'a forebodingr war not in a state of mind to rein their influence 
he tried to moon him out of fear which the different judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd 
but the many hours of each day in which he was left entirely alone were but too favourable for the admission of every melancholy idea and he could not express from his mind the persuasion that he could see marianne no more 
sense and sensibility on the morning of the third day however the goom’yeanticipations of both were almost done away 
s w a mr han-is arrived he declared his patient materially better 
her purse was much stronger and every symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit 
elinor concerned in every latent hope wan all cheerfulnesa 
rejoicing that in her letter to her mother the had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend in making very light of the disposition which delayed them at cleveland and almost fixing on the time when marianne would be able to travel 
but the day did not close so suspiciously as it began 
towards the evening marianne became ill again growing more heavy res less and uncomfortable than before 
her sister however still aangnine was willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of having let up to have bed made 
and carefully a administering the cordial prescribed saw her with satisfaction wink at last into a slumber from which the expected the most beneﬁcial effects 
herdeep though not so quiet as elinor wished to see it lasted a considerable time 
and anxious to observe the result of it herself she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it 
mr jennings knowing nothing of any change in the patient went unusually early to bed 
her maid who was one of the principal purse was creating herself in the housekeeper room and elinor remained alone with marianne 
the repose of the latter became more and more disturbed 
and her sister who watched with unremitting attention her continual change of posture and heard the frequent but inaniculate sounds of complaint which pcasedherli was almost wishing to use bertram to painful a number when marianne snddenl awakened by some accidental noise in the house turned hastily up and with feverish wildness cried out n. d in sense and sensible 
his mama coming 
s not yet replied the other concerning her terror end animg marianne to lie down again 
“hut-howl be here i hope before it in long 
it in a great way you know from hence to barton 
but she must not go round by london cried marianne in the lame hurried manner 
i shall never ice her if the goes to london 
elinor lived with alarm that the want quite herself an while attempting to soothe her eagerly felt her pulse 
it was lower and quicker than even and marianne still talking wildly of mama her alarm increased to rapidly at to determine her on reading inmotly for mr harriet and deepatching a manner to barton for her mother 
to consult with colonel brandon on the best means of expecting the latter was a thou t which immediawa followed the resolution of it 
since 
and as soon an she had rung up the maid to take her place by her sister she hastened own to the drawing-room where she knew he was generally to he found at a much later hour than at present 
it my no time for imitation 
her fan and her dillicultiee were immediately before him 
her fears he had no courage no confidence to attempt the removal of 
— he listened to them in silent deepondence 
but her diflicultiel were instantly obviated for with i reading that learned to speak the occasion and the service prearranged in his mind he offered himself up the meraenger who should fetch mr dashwood 
elinor made no since that was not easily overcome 
she asked him with a brief though fervent gratitude and while he went to hurry off his death with a nteenlfe to mr harriet and an order for pan-honee direc ill wrote a few line to her mother the comfort of such a friend at that moment an colonel brandon 
of inch a companion for her mother s and sensibility

as for us the shock of such a summons and be lessened to her hit presence his manner his usimnoe would lessen it 
he meanwhile whatever he might feel acted with all the calmness of a collected mind made every necessary arrangement with the utmost despatch and calculated with exactness the dine in which she might look for his return 
not a moment was lost in delay of any kind 
the horses arrived even before they were expected and colonel brandon only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear hurried into the it was then about twelve o'clock and she returned to her sister s a t to wait for the arrival of the apothecary to watch by her the rent of the night 
it wan a night of almost equal ruii'erlug to both 
hour after hour passed away in eleeplees pain and delirium on marianne s ride an in the most cruel anxiety on elinor s before mr harriet appeared 
her apprehensions once raised paid by their excuses for all her former security and the servant who at up with her for she would not allow my jennings to be called only tortured her more by hints of what her had always than t 
hg'ianne’s ideas were still at intervals ﬁxed incoherently on her mother and whenever she mentioned her name it gave a pang to the heart of poor elinor who maching herself for having trifled with man days mum and wretched for some immediate relief fancied that all relief might soon he in vain that everything had been delayed too long and pictured to herself her entering mother arriving too late to see that darling child 
or to see her rational 
she was on the point of sending again for mr harriet r48 sees and smsrnxurv 
or if be could not come for some other advice when the former 
but not till after ﬁve o’clock 
married 
his opinion however made some little amends for his dear for though acknowledging a very unexpected and up eaeant alteration in his patient he would not allow the danger to be material and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment mutt procure with a confidence which in a longer degree we communicated to elinor 
he promised to call again in the come of three or four hours and left both the paint and her anxious attendant more composedly thanhehad found them 
with strong concern and with man reproached for not being called to their aid did mr enmnga hear in the morning of what had passed 
her former apprehemiooa now with greater moon restored left her no doubt of the event 
— and though trying to speak comfort to elinor her conviction of her iittet’t danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope 
her heart was really grieved 
the rapid day the early death of a girl if young so lovely as marianne must have struck a let interencd person with concern 
on mr jennings as companion she had other claims 
she had been for three month her companion was still under her care and the was known to have been greatly injured and long unhappy 
the distress of her lines too particular favourite wan before her 
— 
and no for their mother when mrs jennings considered that marianne might probably be to bar what charlotte was to herself her sympathy in her pilfering was very sincere 
mr harriet wan punctual in his second visit 
— but he came to be disappointed in his hope 
of what the last would produce 
all medicine had failed g 
the fever was unabated 
and marianne only more quiet 
not more hemlf+remained in an heavy an r. elinor catching all and more than all his fear to a moment sense and snusrnxu'rv 
is proceed to call in farther advice but he judged it unneoelu 
he had still something more to try come fresh application of whose suceeu he was almost a consent on the inn and his visit concluded with encouraging insurances which reached the ear but could not enter the hem of mine dashwood 
she wan calm 
except when she thought of her mother but the was almost hopeless 
and in this state she continued till noon scarcely stirring from her sister s bed her thoughts wandering from one image of grief one sull‘ering friend to another and her spirit oppressed to the utmost by the company of mrs jennings who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous disposition which marianne’s disappointment had brought on 
elinor felt all the reasonableness the idea and it gave freeh mieeryto her reflections 
about noon however a the began 
— but with a caution i dread of some disappointment which for some time kept her silent even to her friend 
to fancy to hope she could perceive a alight amendment in her after i pulse 
— she waited watched examined it again and again 
— and at it with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness than all her foregoing distress ventured to communicate her hopes 
mr jennings though forced on examination to acknowledge a temporary revival tried to keep her young friends from indulging a thought of it 
continuance 
and elinor coming over every in'unetion afflict-rust told her self likewiae not to hope 
at it was too late 
hope had already entered 
and feeling all in anxious latter the bent over her sister to watch 
she hardly knew for what 
half an hour passed away and the favourable symptom yet blessed her 
others even arose to concern it 
her breath her skin her ii all altered elinor with sign 
of amendment an marianne fixed her 10 sense and sensibility 
he on her with a total though gaze 
anxiety and hope now oppressed her in equal degrees and left her no moment of tranquillity till the arrival of mr harriet at four o'clock 
— when his aneurancea hie felicitatiom on a recovery in her sins even supposing hit expectation gave her confidence comfort and turn of 
iiirianne was in every respect materially better and he declared her entirely out of danger 
mr jennings perhapiatieﬁed with the partial justification of her orebodingl which had been found in their late alarm allowed herself to trust in his judgment and admitted with unfeigned joy and noon with unequivocal cheerfulneta the probability of an entire recovery 
elinor could not be cheerful 
her joy was of a different kind and led to anything rather than to gaiety 
marianne rcttnrcd to life health friends and to her doating mother was an idea to all her head with relations of exquisite comfort and explain it in fervent gratitude 
but it led to no outward demonstration of joy no words no trnileu 
all within elinor breast wantitfaction silent and strong 
she continued by the side of her sister with little intention the whole afternoon calming every fear iatilfying every inquiry of her enfeebled opirltl supply every humour and watching almost every look ancgl every breath 
the possibility of a relapse would of course in some moments occur to remind her of what anxiety was 
but when the saw on her frequent and minute examination that every symptom of recovery continued and raw marianne at six o'clock sink into a quiet steady and to as a arance com double it be silenced every doubt 
up up the time was now drawing on when colonel brandon might be expected back 
at ten o'clock the trulted or at least not much later her mother would i sense and sensibility 
15 be relieved from the dreadful an in which she must 
now be travelling towards them 
the colonel tooi 
— perhaps scarcely less an object of pity l 
— oh how slow was the progress of time which yet kept then in i orance 
t seven o'clock leaving marianne still sweetly asleep she joined mrs jennings in the drawing-room to tea 
of breakfast she had been kept by her fears and of dinner by their sudden reverse from eating much 
— and the present refreshment therefore with such feelings of content as she brought to it was particularly welcome

marianne slept through every blast and the travellers 
— they had a rich reward in store for every present inconvenlcnce

she knew not what to do 
the poe‘iihility of colonel brandon arriving and finding him there came across her 
but she had promised to hear him and her curiosity no less than her honour was en ed 
after a moment's recollection therefore concluding that pmdence required despatch and that her acquiescence would beat promote it she walked uilently today the table and sat down 
he took the opposite chair and for half a minute not word was laid by either 
a pray be quick air a said elinor impatiently 
a i have no time to a he was sitting in an attitude of deep medihn'on end netned not to hear her

he repeated the inquiry with yet ter eagerness 
a for i sake tell me it she out of danger or in the not pay a a we hope she is he to us and walked across the room

elinor looked at him with greater milbnunt than ever 
she begun to think that he must he in liquor 
— the strangeness of such a visit and of such moment seemed no otherwise intelligible 
and with this imprution the immediately rose toying 
— mr willoughby i advise you at present to return to come 
i am not it leisure to remain with you longer 
whatever your business may be with me it will be better recollected and explained to-morrow.” a i understand you he replied with an expressive mile and a voice perfectly calm 
you i am very drunk 
a point of parted with myself bcefat marborough wan enough to overlet me at marlborough 
a cried elinor more and more at a loss to demand what he would be at

that 
whatever other unpardonable folly might ring him to cleveland he wan not brought there by intoxication the laid after a moment's recollection 
a mr willoughby you 01435 
to feel and i certainly in 
that after what has passed 
your coming here in this manner and forcing yourself upon my notice requires a very particular excuse 
hat in it that you mean by it 
7 a i mean said he with serious energy 9 if i can to make you hate me one degree lem than you do now 
i mean to offer some kind of explanation some kind of apology for the plan 
to open my whole heart to you and by convincing you that though i have been always a piece of victunlt eaten between mule

x 5 5 s blockhem‘l i have not been always i rascal to obtain something like in veness from whom your sister a a is this the reason of your coming 
a 7 a no my soul it is 
was his answer with a warm which brown but ill the former willoughby to her remembrance an in spite of herself made her 11 him sincere 
a if that is all you may be satisfied already 
for marianne does 
she has long given you 
has she 
— he cried in the same eager tone 
— when she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it 
but she shall forgive me again and on more reasonable grounds 
now will you listen me 
a elinor bowed her assent 
i do not know a said he after a pause of expectation on her side and thoughtfulness on his own 
a how you may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me 
perhaps you will hardly think the better of me 
it is worth the trial however and you shall her everything 
when i first became intimate in your family i had no other intention no other view in the soqumntanoe than to my time pleasantly while i was obliged to remain in ‘evonshire more pleasantly than i had ever done before 
your sisters lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me 
and her behaviour to me almost from the first was of a kind 
it is astonishing when i reflect on what i was and what the was that my heart should have been so insensible l 
but at rest i must confess my vanity only was elevated by it 
careless of her happiness thinking only of my own amusement giving way to feelings which i had always been too much in the habit of indulging i endeavoured by every means in my power to make myself pleasing to her without any design of returning her affection miss dashwood at this point turning her eyes on 156 says and snusmu'rv 
him with the most angry contempt stopped him by in 
yet it is hardly worth while mr will for you to relate or for me to listen an longer 
such a begin 
sing as this can not be follow by anything 
do not let me be pained by hearing anything more on the subject 
3 s 1 a i insist on your hearing the whole of it a he replied 
a my fortune was never large and i had always been expensive always in the habit of associating with proper of better income than myself 
every year since my coming of age or even before i believe had added to my d 
and though the death of my old cousin mrs smith was to set me free yet that event being uncertain and in far distant it had been for some time my intention to re-establish in circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune 
of attach myself to your sister therefore was not a thing to thought of 
and with a meanness selﬁshness cruelty 
which no indignant no contemptuous look even of yours miss dashwood can ever reprobate too much 
i was acting in this manner trying to engage her regard without a thought of renewing it 
but one thing my be said for me even in that horrid state of selfish vanity i did not know the extent of the injury i medila because i did not but know what it was to love 
but have 1 ever known it s 
well may it be doubted 
for had i really loved could i have sacrificed my feelings to vanity to avarice 
— or what is more could i have sacrificed hers e 
but i have done it 
to avoid i come rative novelty which her affection and her society wo d have deprived of all its horrors i have by raising myself to influence lost everything that could make it a blessing a you did then a said elinor a little softened a believe yourself at one time attached to her sense 
and swsibiwi a to have ruined such attractions to have withstood inch tendernessl 
is there a man on earth who could have done it s 
yes i found myself by insensible degrees sincerely fond of her 
and the happiest hours of my life were what i spent with her when i felt my intentions were strictly honourable and m feelings blamelees 
even men however when fully determined on paying my addresses to her i allowed myself most improper to put off from day to day the moment of doing it from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while m circumstances were so greatly embarrused 
i not reason here 
nor will i up for you to expatiated on the absurdity and the worst than absurdity of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was ahead hound 
he event has proved that i was a cunning is providing with great circumspection for a possible of vanity of making myself couple and wretch for ever 
at last however my reeo ution wan taken and i had determined as noon as i could engage her alone to justify the attention had so invariath paid her and openly assure her of an affection which i had already taken such pains to display 
but in the interest 
in the interest of the very few hours that were to before i could have an opportunity of making with her in private 
a circumstance occurred an unlucky circumstance to in all my resolution and with it all my comfort 
a discovery took lace 1 
here he hesitated and looked down mrs smith had how or other been informed i imagine by some distant relation whose interest it w to give me of her favour of an air a connexion 
but need not explain myself farther he added looking at her with a heightened colour and an inquiring eye your part cular intimacyuyou have probably heard the whole story long a ay a i bye returned elinor colouring likewise and to 8 sons m susmtm

could it he an impartial one 
i acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been rt-qxrctul by me 
i do not mean to justify myself but at the lame time can not leave you to suppose that i have nothing to urge 
that became the wan injured he was irreproachnble

i heartily with it had never been 
but i have injured more than herself 
and i have injured one whose affection for me may i say it 2 was scarcely less warm than here and whose mind 
oh 
how infinitely superior 
7 a your indifference however towards that unfortunate girl 
i must say it unpleasant to me an the discussion of such a subject may well be

but a no my soul i did not know it a he warmly replied 
a did not recollect that i had omitted to give her my direction 
and common-sense might have told her how to and it out sens 
and sensibility 5 well sir and what said mrs smith is a she taxed with the offence at once and my confusion may be guessed 
the purity of her life the formality of her notions her i price of the world 
everything was against me 
he matter itself i could not deny and vain was every endeavour to soften it 
she was previously disposed i believe to doubt the morality of my conduct in general and was moreover discontented with the very little attended the very little portion of my time that hid bestowed on her in my present visit 
in short it ended in a total breach 
by one measure i might have saved myself 
in the her but of her morality good woman 
she opened to forgive the if i would marry eliza 
that could not be 
— and was formally dismissed from her favour and her 
house 
the night following this affair 
i was to go the next morning 
was spent me in deliberating on what my future conduct should 
the struggle was great 
— 
but it ended too soon 
my affection for marianne my thorough conviction of her attachment to name 
it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches which i was natural inclined to feel and expensive society had incre 
i had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife if i chose to address her and i persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do 
an heavy scene however awaited me before i could leave devonshire 
i was engaged to dine with you on that very day some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking the engagement 
but whether i should write this a to or deliver it in person was 3 hint of long to 
to see marianne i felt would be dreadful and i even doubted whether i could see her again and keep to my resolution 
in that point however i undervalued my own magnanimity as the event declared for 160 am all sustain“ i went i as her and awherntilerable and either miau'able

i could not bear to leave the country in i manner that might lead you or the rest of the neighbourhood to expect any part of what had really wanted between mrs smith and myself and i resolved therefore on calling at the cottage in my way to honiton 
the light of your dear sister however was really dreadful 
and to heighten the matter i found her alone 
you were all gone i do not know where 
i had left her only the evening before to fully is warmly resolved within myself on doing right 
a few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever 
and i remember how happy how my were my spirit up i walked from the cottage to a chasm satisfied with myself delighted with everybody but in our last interview of friendship i approached her with a some of guilt that almost took from me the power of diaacmbling

he had outwardly torn herself now when no longer allowable governed every thought 
and the connexion for the sake of which he had with little sample left her sister to misery was likely to prove aware of unhappiness to himself of air more incurable nature

willoughhy in spite of all his faults excited a degree of commreeration for the sufferings produced by them which made her drink of him at now separated for mr from her family with no indeed a regret rather in proportion up she soon acknowledged within here to hit wishethln to his merit 
she felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight 
by that pen of unenrnrmn attraction 
that open affectionate and lively manner which it no merit pone-11nd by that still 10 sense and sensibility 
ardent love for marianne which it was not even innit» sent to indulge 
but she felt that it was so long long before she could feel his influence less 
when at last ill returned to the uncomcious marianne she found her just awaking refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes 
elinor’u hart want full 
the past the recent the futurewilloughby’s visit marianne’s pretty and her mother expected arrival threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept of every indication of fatigue and 
may e her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister 
short was the time however in which that fear could affect her for within half-an-hour after willoughby leaving the home she was again called down-mire by the sound of another carriage 
eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment’s horrible luv presence she ran immediately into the hall and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it 
mrs dashwood whoee terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of marianne’s being no more had no voice to inquire after her no voice even for elinor 
but be waiting neither for ealutation nor inquiry instantly gave the joyful relief 
— and her mother catching it with all her usual warmth was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness as she had been before by her fears 
she was supported into the drawing-room between her daughter and her friend and there ahedding tears of joy though still unable to speak embraced elinor again nod again turning from her at intervals to press 
colonel bnndon’e hand with a look which spoke at once her gratitude and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the basis of the moment 
he shared it however in e silence even greater than her own 
as soon as mrs dashwood had recovered herself to sense and sensibility

lee marianne was 
hers deire 
and in two minutes she wet with her beloved child rendered dearer to her than ever by aheence unhappiness and danger 
elinor‘e delight as she saw what each felt in the meeting was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing arisen of further else but mrs dashwood could be calm could be even rudent when the life of a child was sake and anne satisfied in knowing her mother wan near her and conscious of being too weak for conversation eubmitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nuree around her 
m wood would it up with her all night and elinor in compliance with her rnother’l entreat went to bed

of the most wearing anxiety seemed to make spirits was lee t or 
irritation of irish 
willourg‘lilsy poor willoughby 9 at she now as owed herself to call him was constantly in her thou htt 
the would not but have heard his vindication for e world and now blamed now uitted herself for having judged him so harshly he re 
but her promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful 
she dreaded the performance of it dread what it effect on marianne might be 
doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another and for a moment wished willoughby a widower 
then remembering colonel brandon reproved herself felt that to be suffering and by constancy far more than to hit rivals the reward of her sister was due and wished anything rather than mrs willoughhy'l death 
the shock of colonel brandon’s errand at barton had been much softened to mrs dashwood by her own i alann 
for so great we her uneuineet about me that the had already determined to set out for cleveland on that very day without waiting for any farther intelligence and had so far settled her journey 1

to judge from the colonel spirits however you have not yet made him equally sanguine “no

arianne’s illness though weakening in its kind had not been long enough to make her recovery slow 
and with youth natural strength and her mother presence in aid it proceeded so monthly up to enable her to remove within four after the arrival of the latter into my palmer drening-room 
when there at her own particular request for she wan impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her mother colonel brandon was invited to vi n't her 
his emotion in entering the room in seeing her altered looks and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him was such an in elinor’s conjecture must arise from something more than his affection for marianne 
or the consciousness of its being known to others 
and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying complexion an he looked at her sister the probable recurrence of many pan scenes of misery to his mind brought back by that resemblance between marianne and eliza already acknowledged and now strengthened by the hollow eye the sickly skin the rest of declining weakness and the warm acknowl guest of peculiar obligation

mrs dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former favourite 
she rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his imputed guilt 
she was sorry for him 
she wished him happy 
but the feelings of the past could not be recalled 
nothing could restore but with a faith unbroken 
a character unblemished to marianne 
nothing could do away the knowledge of what the latter had offered through his menus nor remove the guilt of hit conduct toward eliza 
nothing could place him therefore in her former «teem nor injure the interest of colonel brandon

the servant who now only that mine marianne wan taken ill had sense sought to call one of the maids 
who with mr duhwood’s nuance supposed her into the other room

quite dashwood immediately took all that trouble on behalf and elinor had the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it

7 a yes nui’am i just see him leaning hack in it but he did not look up 
— he never wan a gentleman much for talking as elinor i heart could easily account for his not putting herself forward 
and mrs dashwood probably found the earnest explanation

they come straight from town as miss lucy 
mr f errors told me a and are going further westward 
a yes madam 
but not to hide long 
they will soon he back again and then they be cure and call here mrs dashwood now looked at her daughter 
but elinor knew better than to expect them 
she recognized the whole of lucy in the manage and was very confident that edward would never come near them 
she observed in a low voice to her mother that they were probably going down to mr l’ratt’l near 1’ month 
homn’u intelligence seemed over 
elinor looked a. if she wished to hear more

a no ma'am 
the horses was just coming out but i could not hide any longer 
i was afraid of being lasted a did mrs ferraro look well 21 a yes madam she said how she was very well 
and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady 
and she seemed vastly contented 
mrs dashwood could think of no other question and thomas and the table-cloth now alike needless were soon after dismissed 
marianne had already sent to say that she should eat nothing more 
mrs dashwood and elinor s appetite were equally lost and margaret might think herself very well off that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced so much reason as they had often had to be careless of the meals she had never been obliged to go without her dinner here 
when the dessert and the wine were arranged and mrs dashwood and elinor were left to themselves they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfiilneand silence 
mrs dashwood feared to hazard any remark and ventured not to offer consolation 
she now found that she had erred in relying on elinor’s representation of herself 
and justly concluded that 
everything had been expressly softened at the time to spare her from an increase of unhappiness suffering as she then had suffered for marianne 
she found that she had been misled by the careful the considerate attention of her daughter to think the attachment which once she had so well understood 
much slighter in reality than she had been wont to believe or than it was now proved to be 
she feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust inattentive 
nay 
almost unkind to her elinor 
that marianne’s aﬂliction because more acknowledged more immediately before her had too much engrossed her tenderness and led her away to sense and sensibility 
19 forget that in elinor she might have a daughter suﬂ‘erisg almost as much certainly with less self-provocation a greater fortitude 
chapter ﬁll-13 
nor new found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event however cermin the mind m be told to consider it and certainty itself 
she now found that in spite of herself she had always admitted a hope while edward remained single that something would occur to prevent his marrying lucy 
that some resolution of his own some education of friends or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady would arise to assist the happiness of all 
but he was now married and she condemned her heart for the lurking latter which so much heightened the pain the intelligence 
that he should be married so soon before as she imagined he could be in orders and consequently before he could be in possession of the living surprised her a little at first 
but she soon saw how likely it was that lucy in her self-provident care in her haste secure him should overlook everything but the risk of delay 
they were married married in town and now hastening down to her uncle 
what had edward felt on being within four miles of barton on seeing her mother servant on hearing lucy’s message 
they would soon she supposed be settled at deal or 
delaford that place in which so much conspired to give her an interest 
which she wished to be acquainted with and yet desired to avoid 
she saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house 
saw in lucy the active conniving manager uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality and ashamed h. s 4 sense and sensibhjtv 
to he expected of half mr economical practice 
— pursuing her own intern in every thou ht owning the favour of colonel bmmlon of an evening and of every wealthy friend 
in edward she knew not what the law nor what the wished to see 
ham or unhappy 
nothing pleased her 
— she hunted away her head from every sketch of him 
l'ilinor flattered herself that some one of their connexions in london would write to them to announce the event and give farther particulars 
but day after day passed off and brought no letter no tidings 
though uncertain that any one were to blame the found fault with every absent friend 
they were all thoughtless or indolent 
a when do you write to colonel brandon ma’arn 2 a was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on 
a i wrote to him my love last week and rather expect to see than to hear from him again 
i mostly pressed his coming to us and should not be surprised to see him walk in to-day or to-morrow or any day this was gaining something something to look forward to 
colonel brandon rum 
have some information to we 
learn or had the so determined it when the cure d a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window 
he stopped at their gate 
it was it gentleman it was colonel brandon himself 
now she should hear more 
— and she trembled in expectation of it 
but 
it was not colonel brandonuneither his air nor his height 
were it possible she should say it must be edward 
she looked again 
he had just mounted 
— she could not he mistaken 
it was edward 
she moved away and sat down

i will be calm

2 in a moment she perceived that the other were likewise aware of the mistake 
she saw her mother and marianne change colour 
saw them look at herself and whisper a few sentences to each other 
she would have given the world to be able to speak 
and to make them understand that she hoped no coolness no slight would appear in their behaviour to him 
— 
but she had no utterance and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion 
not a syllable passed aloud 
they all waited in silence for the appearance of their visitor 
his footsteps were heard along the gravel path 
in a moment he was in the passage and in another he was before them 
his countenance as he entered the room was not too happy even for elinor 
his complexion was white with agitation and he looked as it fearful of his reach son and conscious that he merited no kind one 
mrs dashwood however conforming as she trusted to the wishes of that daughter by whom the then meant in the warmth of her heart to be guided in everything met him with a look of forced complacency gave him her hand and wished him joy 
he coloured and atammcrcd out an unintelligible reply 
elinor’s lips had moved with her mother and when the moment of action was over she wished that the had shaken hands with him too 
but it was then too late and with a countenance meaning to be open she sat down again and talked of the weather 
marianne had related as much as possible out of sight to conceal her distress 
and margaret understanding some part but not the whole of the case thought it incumbent on her to he dignity and therefore took a seat as far from him as she could and maintained a strict silence 
when elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season a very awful pause took place 
it was put 196 sense and sensibility 
an end to by mr dashwood who felt obliged to hope that he had left mrs fears very well 
in a hurried manner he replied in the affirmative 
another pause 
elinor resolving to exert herself though fearing the sound of her own voice now said 
2 in mr ferraro 
at languaple 2 a at longsuiple 
— 
he replied with an air of surprise 
a no my mother is in own a i meant it elinor taking up some work from the table a to inquire after mr edward ferrari.” she dared not look up 
— but her mother and marianne both turned their eyes on him 
he coloured seemed perplexed looked doubtingly and after some hesitation said 
— 
perhaps you mean 
my brother 
you mean mr 
mrs rain-i fermnt” 5 on robert ferraro 
s was repeated by marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement 
— and though elinor could not speak even per eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder 
he rose from his seat and walked to the window apparently from not knowing what to do 
took up a pair of scissors that lay there and while spoiling both them and their health by cutting the latter to pieces an he spoke said in an hurried voice 
— a perhaps you do not know 
you may not have call that my brother is lately married to 
to the youngest 
to miss lucy steele his words were echoed with unspeakable altonithment by all but elinor who eat with her head leaning over her work in a state of such agitation as made her hard

edward who had till then looked anywhere rather than at her now her hurry away and perhaps as 
or even hard 
her motion 
for immediately afterwards fell into a reverie which no remnrkl no enquiries no affectionate address of mr dashwood could penetrate and at last widqu saying a word quitted the room and walked out toward the village leaving the others the greatest punishment and anxiety on a change in his situation so wonderful an no sudden 
a. perplexity which they had no mean of evening but by their own conjecture 
chapter 15 
unaccountable however an the circumerzncee of still release might a or to the whole family it was certain that edward was free 
and to what purpose that freedom would be employed wu euily predetermined by all 
for after experiencing the blessings of an imprudent engagement contracted without his mother consent as he had already done for more than four years nothing less could be expected of him in the failure of bath than the immediate connection of another 
his errand at barton in fact we a i m lee one 
it won only to all elinor to marry him 
an considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in inch a question it might be strange that he could feel an uncomfortable in the present one no he really did so much in need of encouragement and fresh air

nay i am sure it would never have happened 
for though i left longttaple with what i thought at the time a most unconqnerable preference for his niece yet had then had any pursuit any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months i should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment especially by mixing more with the world an in such a case sense and sensrmnm

but instead of having anything to do 
instead of having any profusion chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any myself i returned home to he one idle 
and for the hint twelvemonth afterwarda him even the nominal employment which belonging to the university would have given me for i war not entered at oxford till i was nineteen 
i had therefore nothing in the world to do 
but to fancy myself in love 
and at m mother did not make my home in every respect com enable 
as i had no friend no companion in my brother and talked new acquaintance it was not unnatural for me to be very often at longstaple where i always felt myself at home and was always sure of a welcome

the change which a few hours had brought in the mind and the happiness of the dashwood was inch

he had quieted oxford within four-and-twenty hours after lucy s letter arrived end with on one object before him the nearest mad mbsrton had no leisure to form an there of conduct with which that road did not the most intimate connexion 
he could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with miss dashwood 3 end by his rapidity in seeing that fate it in to be supposed in to of the jealous with which he had once thought of colonel 
bundon 
in spite of the with which he met his own deserts and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts lie did notuponthewhoe expect me rec tion 
was his business however to at he rﬁdflnhd he said it very prettily 
what he might say on the subject a twelvemonth sister must he re erred to the imagination of huahnnda and wives 
that lucy had certainly meant to deceive to go of with s ﬂourieh of malice against him in her e by them was my clear to elinor 
and e ward himself now you my enlightened on her character had no en 
less in leaving her ca leg of the utmost woeo wanton ill-nature 
though his eyes 20 sense and sensibiu’i’y 
been long opened even before hit acquaintance with elinor began to her ignorance and a want of liberty in some of her opinions they had been equally impulse by him to her want of education 
and till her last letter reached him he had always believed him s to be a gale ditpoeed good-hearted girl and though my attach to himself 
nothing but inch 2 pertuation could have prevented hit putting an end to an engagement which one before the discovery of it laid him open to hit mothth anger had been 3 continual course of disquiet and regret to him 
i thought it my duty 3 said he independent of my feelings to give her the opinion of containing the engagement or not when i war renounced by my mother and mode to all appearance without a friend in the world to insist me 
in inch 3 station at that where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature how could i suppose when the to earnestly to wamrly insisted on sharing my fate whatever it might be that anything but the most disinterested affection was her-inducement 
and even now i cannoti comprehend on what motive the acted or what fancied advantage it could be to her to be lessened to a mind for whom the had not the smallest regard and who had only two thousand pounds in the world 
she could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me i live 
i but the might suppose that something would occur in your favour 
that your own family might in time relent 
and at anyrate the lost nothing by continuing the engagement for the hat proved that it lessened neither her inclination nor her actions 
the connexion was certainly a respectable one and probably gained her conﬁdention among her friends 
and if nothing more advantageously occurred it would be better for her to marry you than he tingle.” sense and sensibility 
not edward was of course immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than lucy’s oon~ duty nor more self-evident than the motive of it 
elinor scolded him harshly as ladies always scold the impnrdcnoe which compliments themselves for having spent so much time with them at norland when he most 
have felt his own inconmncy 
your behaviour was certainly very wrong 3 said she a because 
to say nothing of my own conviction 
our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect wm as you were less situated could never be he could only plead an ignorance of his own heart and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement 
a i was simple enough to think that because my family wan plighted to another there could be no danger in my being with you 
and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred up my honour 
i felt that i admired you but i told myself it wan only friendship 
and till i began to make comparisons between yourself and lucy i did not know how far i was got 
after that i cup so i must wrong in remaining so much in sussex antixihc arguments with which i mooncilcd myself to the expediency of it were no better than these 
t he danger is my own i i am doing no injury to anybody but myself 
elinor smiled and shook her head 
edward heard with pleasure of colonel brandon being expected at the cottage as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him but to have an opportunity of convincing him thathenolonger resented hrl giving him the living of delaford 
a which at present a said he a after thank-so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion he must think i have never forgiven him for offering 
now he felt maished himself that he had never yet been to the place 
but so little interest had he taken in not sense and sensrsrurv 
the matter that he owed all his knowledge of the house garden and glebe extent of the risk condition of the and and rate of the tithes to linger herself who had heard so much of it from colonel brandon and heard it with so much attention as to beentirely mistress of the subject 
no question after this one remained undecided between them one difficulty only was to be overcome 
they were brought together by mutual affection with the warmest zrp approbation of their real friends 
their intimate knowl age of each other seemed to make their happiness certain 
and they only wanted something to live upon 
edward had two thousand pounds and elinor one which with delaford living was all that they could call their own 
for it was impossible that mrs dashwood should advance anything and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and at months a year would supply them with the comforts of a 
edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable than e in his mother towards him 
and on that he rested or the residence of their income 
but elinor had no such dependance 
for since edward would still be unable to marry miss barton and his chusing herself had been spoken of in mrs fen-ars’s ﬂattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing lucy steele she feared that robert olﬁmoc would serve no other purpose than to enrich fanny 
about four days after edward s arrival colonel brandon appeared to complete my dashwood’s satisfaction an to give her the dignity of having for the first time since her living at barton more company with her than her house would hold 
edward was allowed to retain the privilege of ﬁrst-comer and colonel brandon therefore walked every night to his old quarters at the park 
from whence he usually returned in the sense and sensibility 
27 morning earl enough to interrupt the lover lint titea-tétc before renkfut 
a three weeks residence it delaford where in listening hour at lemhehadlittletodobuttocalenlate the disproportion between thirty-nix nod mm brought him to barton in a turn s of mind which needed all the improvement in morrmne’e loch all the kindness of her welcome and all the encourath of her mother’language to make it cheerful 
among such friend 
however and we latter he did revive 
no rumour of lucy’s marriage had yet reached him 
he knew nothing of what had passed and the list hour of hit visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering 
everything wan explained to him by mr dashwood and he found fresh moon to rejoice in what he had done for mr few line eventually it promoted the interest of elinor it would be needles to nay that the gentlemen dance in the good opinion of each other a they advanced in each other acquaintance for it could not be otherwise 
their resemblance in good principle 
and good operate in disposition end manner of thinking would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship without any other attraction 
but their being in love with two linen and two listen fond of each other made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment 
the letterfrom town which a few before would have made every never in elinor’s body thrill with tramport now arrived to be read with less emotion than mirth 
mr jennings wrote to tell the wonderful able to vent her honest indignation against the jiltﬂg andpourforthhercompouiontowardlpoor ward who nhewnuure hadquitedoated uponthe worthleu hurry and was now by all accounts 
almost broken 
at oxford 
i do think a the con.208 sens 
and slnslblllty 
turned “nothingwaseveroaniedonsosly 
foritwas but two days before lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me 
not a soul suspected anything of the matter not even fanny who poor soul 
came crying to me the day after in a great fright for fear of ferraro as well as not knowing how to get to plymouth 
for lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married on put we sup 
rose to make a shewwitluandpoor ancyhad not seven shillings in the world 
— so i was very glad to give her ever reads to take her down to exeter where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with mrs business in hopes as i tell her to fall in with the doctor again 
and i must say that lucy’s crossness not to take her along with them in the chaise is worse than all 
poor mr edward 
i can not t him out of my head but you must send for him to son and miss marianne moat try to comfort him mr dashwood’s strains were more solemn 
mrs ferraro was the most unfortunate of women 
poor fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility 
and he considered the existence of each under inch a blow with grateful wonder 
robert offence was in but lucy’s was infinitely worse 
neither of them was ever again to be mentioned to mrs ferraro 
and even if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter nor be submitted to appear in her presence 
the secrecy which every long had~heen carried on between them was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime because had any suspicion of it occurred on the others proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage 
and he called on elinor to join with him in regretting that such s engagement with edward had not ratherlbeen fu liked than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family 
he thus continued 
mr and muniu‘rv 
of my fears has never yet mentioned edward’s name which due 
not surprise up but to our gm utoniuhrnent

but though mr fears did come to see them and always treated them with the make-believe of decent aﬂ'ection they were never insulted by her real favour and preference 
t but was due to the folly of robert and the cunning of his wife

it was an arrangement however justified in its effects if not in it cause 
for nothing ever appeared in robert’s after of living or of talking to give a suspicion of hit regretting the extent of his income as either leaving l'lll brother too little or bringing himself too much
