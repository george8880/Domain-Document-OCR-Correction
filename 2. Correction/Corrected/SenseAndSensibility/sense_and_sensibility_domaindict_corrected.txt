he family of dnshwood had been long settled in guesses 
their estate was large and their residence was at morland park in the centre of their property where for many generations they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance 
the ate owner of this estate was a single man who lived to a very advanced age and who for many years of his life had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister 
but her death which happened ten years before his own produced a great alteration in his home 
for to supply her loss he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew mr henry wood the legal interior of the scotland estate and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it 
in the society of his nephew and niece and their children the old gentleman days were comfortably spent 
his attachment to them all increased 
the constant attention of mr and mrs hey dashwoorl to his windows which proceeded not merely from interest but from goodness of heart gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive 
and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence 
i 
a i sense and sensibility 
by a former marriage mr henry dashed had one son 
3 his present lady three daughters 
the son a step ye be young man was amply provided for by the one of his mother which had been large and half of which resolved on him on his coming of age 
by his own mania e likewise which hasp soon afterwards he had to his wealth 
to him therefore the succession to the scotland estate was not so really important as to his sisters 
for their fortune independent of what might arise to them from their fathers inheriting that property could be but small 
their mother had nothing and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal 
for the remaining society of his first wife fortune was also secured to her child and he had only a life interest in it 
the old gentleman died 
his will was read and like almost every-lather will gave as much disappointed as pure 
e was neither so unjust nor so ungrateful as to leave his estate from his nephew 
but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest 
mr dashed had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son 
but 
to his son and his son s son a child of four ears old it was secured in such a way as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him and who most needed a provision any charge on the estate or by any leg of its vast unable woods 
the whole was tied up for the benefit of this child who in occasional visits with his father and mother at morland had so far gained on the affections of his uncle by such attractions as are by no was unusual in children of two or three years old an imperfect articulate an earnest desire of having his own way many cunning tricks and a great deal of noise as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which for years he had received from his voice and her daughters 
send 
and sensibility 
3 he meant not to be unkind however and as a mark of his affection for the three girls he left them a thousand pounds apiece 
mr dashwood’s die interest was at first severe 
but his temper was cheer up and sanguine and he might reasonably hope to live many years and by living economically lay by 1 considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large and capable of almost immediate improvement 
but the fortune which had been so hardly in coming was his only one twelvemonth 
he survived his uncle no longer 
and ten thousand pounds including the late legacied was all that remained for his widow and daughter his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known and to him mr dashed recommended with all the strength and urgency which illness could come mad the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters 
mr john dnshwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family 
but he was affected by a rest commendation of such a nature at such s time and he promised to do everything in his power to make them comfortable 
his father was rendered easy by such an assurance 
and mr john dnshwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them 
he was not an ill-disposed young man uncle to be rather cold-hearted and rather llellllllll is to be ill shed out he was in new we respected 
for lreﬁnducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties 
had he married a more amiable woman he might have been made still more respectable than he was 
he might even have been made amiable himself 
for he was very young when he married and very fond of his wife 
but mrs john dashed was a silent caricature of himself 
more narrow-minded and self she 
4 sense and sensibility 
when he gave his promise to his father he hesitated within himself to increase the fortunes of his letters by the present of a thousand pounds apiece 
he then a really thought himself equal to it 
e pmsycct of four thousand years in addition to his present income besides the remaining half of his own mother fortune warmed his heart and made him feel ca hide of generosity 
yes he would give them three 22nd pounds it would be liberal and handsome 
it would be enough to make them completely ear 
three thousand pounds 
he could he so candid able a sum with little inconvenience e thought of it all day long and for many days successively and he did not repent 
no sooner was his father's funeral over than my john dalhwood without sending an notice of her intention to her mother-in-law arrived with her child and their attendants 
no one could dispute her right to come 
the house was her husband from the moment of his father's decease 
but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater and to a woman in mrs dashwood’s situation with only common feeling must have been highly unpleasing 
but in her mind there was a sense of honour to keen a generosity so romantic that any offence of the kind by whomsoever given or received was to her a source of immovable disgust 
mrs john dashed had never been a flavour in with any of her husband's family but she had had no opportunity till the present of showing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it 
so acutely did mrs dashed feel this ungracious behaviour and so earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it that on the arrival of the latter she would have quitted the house for ever had not the entirely of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going and her own tender love for sense and sensibility 
5 all her three children determined her afterwards to stay and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother 
liquor this eldest daughter whose advice was so effectual possessed a strength of understanding and coolness of judgment which qualified her though only nineteen to be the counsellor of her mother and enabled her frequently to counteract to the advantage of them all that eagerness of mind in mrs dashed which must generally have led to imprudence 
she had an excellent heart 
her disposition was affectionate and her feelings were strong but she knew how to govern them it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be 
taught 
ah arranges politics were in man respects unite equal to eleanor's 
she was sensibly and clever 
but eager in everything 
her sorrows her joy i could have no moderation 
she was generous amiable e interesting she was everything but prudent 
the resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great 
liquor saw with concern the excess of her sister's sensibility 
but by mrs dashed it was valued and cherished 
they encouraged each other now in the violence of their affection 
the agony of grief which overpowered them at first was voluntarily renewed wan sought for was created again and again 
they gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future 
liquor too was deeply affected 
but still she could struggle she could often herself 
she could consult with her brother could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival and treat her with proper mention and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion and encourage her to similar forbearance 
6 sense and sensibility 
margaret the other sister was a good-humoured well-disposed 
d 3 but as she had already imbibed a good deal of an'anne’s romance without having much of her sense 
the did not at thirteen bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life 
both 3 
is john dashed now insulted herself mistress of scotland 
and her mother and sister-in-law were dreaded to the condition of visitors 
as such however they were treated by her with quiet civility 
and by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself his wife and their child 
he really pressed them with some eagerness to consider morland as their home 
and as no plan appeared so eligible to my dashed as remaining there till she could accommodate heroelfwith a house in the neighbourhood his invitation was accepted 
a continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight was exactly what suit her mind 
in season of cheerfulness no temper could be more cheerful than hers or doom in a greater degree that sanguine expectation of happiness which is his itself 
but in narrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy 
mrs john dashed did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters 
to take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be inqmvcrishing him to the most dreadful degree 
she begged him to think again on the subject 
how could he answer it to himself to rob his child and his only child too of so large a sum 
sense and sensibility 
7 and what possible claim could the main dadrwoods who were related to him only by half blood which the considered an no relationship at all have on his generosity to to large an amount 
it war very well known that no affection war ever in to exist between the children of any man by i rent marriages 
and why was he to ruin himself and their poor little harry by giving away all his money to his half-witted 
it was my father last request to me replied her husband that i should again his widow and daughter 1 he did not know what he was talking of i dare to 3 ten to one but he wan light-hearted at the time 
he been in his right senses he could not leave thought of such a thing in begging on to give away half our fortune from our own chill 
a e did not tip ate for any particular urn my dear fanny 
he only requested me in general terror to admit them and make their situation more uncomfortable than it was in his power to do 
perhaps it would have been at well if he had left it wholly to myself 
he could hardly suppose i should neglect them 
but an he required the promise i could not do leaf than give it at least i thought so at their 
the promise therefore was given and must be something must be done for them whenever they leave ireland and settle in a new home well then it 
something be done for them 
but him 
something need not be three thousand consider 4 the added 2 that when the money ll once parted with it never can return 
your listen will marry and it will be gone for ever 
if indeed it could ever be restored to our poor little in 
-5 why to be mine said her husband very gravely 2 that would make a neat difference 
the time may come when harry will regret that in large a turn was 8 sense and sensibility 
parted with 
if he should have a numerous family for instance it would be a very convenient addition 1 to be sure it would a perhaps then it would be better for all parted the sum were diminished one half 
five hundred would be a prodigious increased to their fortune 
oh beyond an thing great 
what brother on earth would do hill 
a much for him listen even if really his sisters 
and as it it 
only hdfbloodl but on have such a generous spirit i a a would not with to do anything mean he replied a one had rather on inch occasions do too much than too little 
no one at least can think i have not done enough for them even themselves they can hardly expect more there is no knowing what they may expect a laid the lady but we are not to think of their expectation the relation in what you can afford to do a fairly and i think i may afford to give them over hundred pounds a 
piece 
at it in without any addition of mine they will each have above three thousand pounds on their mother's death a very comfortable fortune for any young woman 1 to be sure it it and indeed it strikes me that they can want no addition at all 
they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them 
if they marry they will he sure of doing well 
and if they not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest often thousand pounds 
2 that is very true and therefore i do not know whether upon the whole it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while the lives rather than for them 
something of the antiquity kind i mean 
my sisters would feel the good child of it on well as herself 
a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable sense and sensibility 
9 his wife hesitated a little however in giving her consent to this plan 
to be sure a said she it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once 
but then if mrs wood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in a fifteen years 
my dear fanny 
her life can not be worth half that purchase certainly not 
but if you observe pale always live for ever when there is any anxiety w them 
and the in very stout and healthy and hardly forty 
an anxiety i. a very serious business 
it comes over and over every year and there is no getting rid of it 
you are not aware of what you are doing 
1 have known a great deal of the trouble of anxieties 
for my mother wan flogged with the payment of three to old supemnnuated served by my father s will and it is hung how disagreeable the found it 
twice every year these inquiries were to he paid 
and then then was the trouble of getting it to them 
and then one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing 
my mother was quite sick of it 
her income was not her own she said with such perpetual claims on it 
and it worth more unturned in my ear because otherwise the money would have been entirely it in others disposal without any restrictions whatever 
t hat given me such an abhorrence of anxieties that i am sure i would not in myself down to the payment of one for all the world a it is certainly an unpleasant thing replied mr dashed 1 to have those kind of yearly reins on one income 
one fortune as your mother justly says is no 
one own 
to be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum on every rent day 
is by no mean desirable it takes away never independence undoubtedly 
and after all you have no thanks to sense and sensibility 
for it 
they think themselves endure you do no more than what it expected and it nine no gratitude at all 
if i were you whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely 
i would not bind myself to allow them anything yearly 
it may be very inconvenient some years to apart a hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expense i believe you are right my love 
it will be better that there should be no ingenuity in the cave 
whatever i may give them occasionally will be of far greater distance than a yearly allowance because they would only enlarge their water of living if they felt sure of a larger income and would not 
be expense the richer for it at the end of the year 
it will certainly be much the best way 
a present of fifty pounds now and then will prevent their ever being directed for money and will ll think he amply discharging my promise to my father to be sure it will 
indeed to by the truth i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all 
the since he thought of i dare say was only such as might be reasonably expected of you 
for instance such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them helping them to move their things and lending them present of cash and game and so forth whenever they are in season 
i ll la my life that he meant nothing further 
indeed it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did 
do but conrirlcr my dear mr dashed how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings them in fifty pounds amor pieces and of come they will pay their mother for their board out of it 
altogether they will have live hundred youmr amongst them and what on earth can sense and sensibmjtv 
i four women want for more than that 
they will live so cheap 
their housekeeping will be nothing at all 
they will have no carriage no horses and hardly any servants 
they will keep no company and can have no expenses of any kind 
only conceive how comfortable they will be 
five hundred years 
i am sure i can not imagine how they will spend half of it 
and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it 
they will be much more able to give you something upon m word said mr dashed 
i believe you are be thy right 
my either certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you an 
i clearly understand it now and i will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described 
when in mother remove into another house my services she be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can 
some little present of furniture 
too may be acceptable then 
certainly returned mrs john dushwood 
a but however one thing must be considered 
when your father and mother moved to scotland though the furniture of still was sold all the china plate and linen was saved and is now left to your mother 
her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it that is a material consideration undoubtedly 
a valuable legacy indeed 
and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here eyes 
and the net of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house 
a got deal too handsome in my opinion for any place long can ever afford to live in 
but however so it is 
your father thought only of then 
and i must my this that 12 sense and sensibility 
you owe no particular gratitude to him nor attention to hit whither 
or we very well know that if he could he would have left ill everything in the world to 152m.” this argument was irresistible 
it gave to his intense 
from whatever of decision we wanting before 
and he finally resolved that it would be absolutely momentary if not highly indecorous to do more for the widow and children of his father than such kind of neighbourly acts at his own wife pointed out 
throm333 
is dashed remained at morland several months 
not from any disinclination to mine when the sight of every well-known spot offered to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while 
for when her spirits began to revive and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affections by melancholy remembrance she was impatient to be gone and in estimable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of scotland 
for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible 
but the could hear of no alteration that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease and suited the presence of her eldest daughter whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income which her mother would have approved 
mrs dauhwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour which gave comfort to his lost earth rejection 
she doubted the sincerity of this mania no more than he had doubted it himself and the thought of it for her daughters woke with connection though sense and sensibility 
13 as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than seven thousand pounds would support her in affluence 
for their brother sake too for the sake of his own heart she rejoiced 
and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before in believing him incapable of generosity 
his attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their silence was dear to him and for a long time she warmly relied on the liberality of his intentions 
the contempt which she had very early in their acquaintance felt for her daughter-in-law was very much increased by the further knowledge of her character which half-a-yenr’s residence in her family afforded 
and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility according to the opinions of mrs dashwoo‘d to her daughters continuance at morland 
this circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of mrs john wood a gentleman-like and pleasing young man who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sisters establishment at ireland and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there 
some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest for edward fed was the eldest son of a man who had died very rich 
and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence door except a train sum the whole of his fortune depended on the will no his mother 
but mrs dashed was alike uninfluenced by either consideration 
it was enough for her that he a dared to be amiable that he loved her daughter an that eleanor returned the partiality 
it was contrary to every decline of hen 4 sense aid shsybhjtv 
that difference of fortune should keep couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of a ton 
and that eleanor's merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her was to her company in he 
toward terror was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address 
he was not handsome and his manners required intimacy to make then pleasing 
he was too diffident to do justice to himself 
but when his natural shyness was overcome his behaviour gave every indication of an open affectionate heart 
his understanding was good and his education had given it solid improvement 
but he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister who longed to see him distinguished 
as 
they hardly knew what 
they wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other 
his mother wished to interest him in politician concerns to get him into parliament or to alice him connected with some of the great men of the day 
mrs john daehwood wished it likewise 
but in the meanwhile till one of these superior blessings could be obtained it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche 
but edward had no turn for great men or barouche 
all his wishes centred in domestic comfort and the quiet of private life 
fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising 
edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of mrs dashed s attention 
for she was at that time in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects 
she saw only that he was quiet and obtrusive and she liked him for it 
he did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation 
she was first called to observe and approve him further by a reflection which eleanor sense and sensibility 
15 chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister 
it was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother 
it is enough said she 
to say that he is unlike fanny is enough 
it implies everything amiable 
i love him already 
i think you will like him a said eleanor 1 when you know more of him 
like him 
a replied her mother with a smile 
a i can feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love 
a you may esteem him a i have never yet known what it 
was to separate esteem and love 
mrs dashed now took pains to get acquainted with him 
her manners were attaching and soon banished his'reserve 
she speedily comprehended all his merits 
the persuasion of his regard for liquor perhaps assisted her penetration 
but she really felt assured of his worth and even that witness of manner which irritated against all her established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affectionate 
no sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to plainer than she considered their serious attachment as certain and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching 
a in a few months my dear arrange a said she a minor will in all probability be settled for life 
we shall miss her 
but 11 will be happy a t mamma 
how shall we do without her 
a 
my love it will be scarcely 1 separation 
we shall live within a few miles of each other and shall meet every day of our lives 
you will gain a brother 
no real affectionate brother 
i have the highest opinion in the world of edward hurt 
but you ll sense and sensibility 
look grave variance 
do you disapprove your sister choice 
a perhaps a said arrange a i may consider it with some surprise 
edward is very amiable and i love him tenderly 
but yet he is not the kind of young man 
there is a something wanting his figure is not striking 
it has none of that grace which i should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister 
his eyes want all that spirit that tree which at once announce virtue and intelligence 
and besides all this i am afraid mamma he has no real taste 
music seems scarcely to attract him and though he admires eleanor's drawings very much it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth 
it is evident in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws that in fact he knows nothing of the matter 
he admires as a lover not as a connoisseur 
to satisfy me those characters must be united 
i could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every net coincide with my own 
he must enter into all my feelings 
the same books the same music mum charm us both 
a moral how spiritless how tame was towards manner in reading to us last 
night 
i felt for my sister most severely 
yet she bore it with so much composure she seemed scarcely to notice it 
i could hardly keep my seat 
to hear those beauties lines which have frequently almost driven me wild pronounced with such impenetrable calmness such dreadful indifference 
he would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose 
i thought so at the time 
but you would give him cowper 
nay mamma if he is not to be animated by cowper 1 
but we must allow for difference of taste 
liquor has not my feelings and therefore she may overlook it and be happy with him 
but it would have ﬂaw/ﬂimsy sense and sensibility 
1 broken m heart had i loved him to hear him read with no little mailaility 
mamma the more i know of the world the more am i convinced that i shall never see a man whom i can really love 
i require is much 
he must have all edward s rule and his potent and manners must ornament hire goodness with every possible charming a remember my love that you are not seventeen 
it in yet too early in life to despair of such an happiness 
why should you be i 
fortunate than your mother 
in one circumstance only my marriage may your destiny bediil‘crcnt from here 
a better 3 
a hat a pity it in eleanor aid variance 
that edward should have no note for drawing 
no taste for drawing 
replied eleanor 
why should or think so 
e does not new kind indeed t he has great pleasure in seeing the performance of other people and i assure you he in by no means deficient in natural taste though he i not had opportunities of improving it 
had he ever been in the way of learning think he would have drawn very well 
he slam his own joy t in such matters to much that he in away until in to give his opinion on any picture 
but he ha an innate and simplicity of taste which in general direct him perfectly right marriage was afraid of attending and laid no more on the subject 
but the kind of approbation which eleanor described an excited in him by the drawing e of other people was very far from that rapturous delight i. us 18 sense and sensibility 
which in her opinion could alone be called taste 
yet though smiling within herself at the mistake the honoured her sister for that blind partiality to edward which produced it 
a i hope arrange a continued eleanor 1 on do not consider him is deficient in general taste 
indeed i think i may say that our can not for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial and infirm 
were your opinion i am sure you could never be civil to him variance hardly knew what to my 
she would not wound the feelings of her sister on any account and et to say what she did not believe as impossible 
at length she he lived 
do not offended eleanor if my praise of him it not in everything equal to your sense of his merits 
i have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minute propensities of his mind his inclination and tastes as you have 
but i have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense 
i think him everything that is worthy and amiable 1 i am sure replied eleanor with a smile that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with inch come emendation as that 
i do not perceive how you could ox rest yourself more warmly glinrianne was rejoiced to and her sister so easily pleased 
of his sense and his goodness 1 continued eleanor 1 no one can i think be in doubt who has seen him often enough he to engage him in unreserved conversation 
the excellence of his understanding and his prince is can be concealed only by that shyness which too often kick him silent 
you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth 
but of his manner propensities as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself 
he and i have been at times thrown a good deal together while sense and sensible 
19 you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother 
i have seen a run deal of him have studied his sentiments and his opinion on subjects of literature and taste 
and upon the whole i venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed his enjoyment of books exceedingly great his imagination lively his observation just and correct and his taste delicate and pure 
his abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person 
at first sight his address is certainly not striking 
and his person can hardly be called handsome till the expression of his eyes which are uncommonly good and the general sweetness of his countenance is perceived 
at present i know him so well that i think him really handsome 
or at least almost so 
what my you variance 
a a i shall we soon think him handsome eleanor if i do not now 
hen you tell me to love him as a brother i shall no more see imperfection in his face than i now do in his heart eleanor started at this declaration and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into in speaking of him 
she felt that edward stood very high in her opinion 
she believed the regard to be mutual 
but she required greater certainty of it to make marines conviction of their attachment agreeable to her 
she knew that what marriage and her mother conjectured one moment they believed the next 
that with them to wish was to hope and to hope was to expect 
she tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister 
a i do not attempt to deny a said she 2 that i think very highly of him 
that i greatly esteem that i like him variance here burst forth with indignation 
yes him 
like him 
cold-hearted eleanor 
20 sense and sensibility 
oh 
one than cold-hemedl ashamed of being otherwise 
are the world again and will leave the room this moment 
liquor could not help laughing 
excuse ire laid her and be assured that i mantnooﬁ'ume to our latin into uietawa.ofm ownfeell'ngl 
byill-lite the trouble stronger than have clump 
believe them in about trouble such a lie merit and the suspicion 
the hope of hit affection for me my warrant without impudence or folly 
but further than thin on must not believe 
i am by no mean 
assured of he regard for me 
there are moments when the extent of it means doubtful 
and till his sentiments use fully known you not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality b 1 or calling it more than it is 
in my heart myself little 
scarce ye any doubt of his preference 
but there are other point 
to be convinced maiden he inclination 
he ll very far from being independent 
what his mother really ll we can not know 
but from fanny occasional mention of her conduct and opinions we have never been disposed to think her amiable 
and i in 
very much mistaken if edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way if he were to with to marry a woman who had not either a gun 
fortune or high rank 
variance wan astonished to and how much the imagination of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth 
and you really are not engaged to him 
a said she 
yet it certainly soon will happen 
but two advantage will proceed from thin delay 
i shall not low you in won and edward will have greater hope purity of improving that natural mute for your lavauriu pursuits which must be a indispensably necessary to your future felicity 
oh 
if he should sense and sensibility 
a 
be so far nimulzted by your genius as to learn to draw himself how delightful it would be 
a liquor had given her real opinion to her sister 
she could not consider her partiality for edward in so prosperous a state as marriage had believed it 
there was at times a want of spirit 
about him which if it did not denote indifference spoke a something almost as unpromising 
a doubt of her regard supposing him to feel it need not give him more than inquietude 
it would not be likely to produce that direction of mind which frequent 
attended him 
a more reasonable cause might be and in the de bent situation which formed the indulgence of his i action 
she knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself without strictly attending to her views for his i inducement 
with such a knowledge as this it was impossible for liquor to feel easy on the subject 
she was far from depending on that result of his preference of her which her mother and sister still considered as certain 
nay the longer they were together the male doubtful seemed the nature of his regard 
and sometimes for a few painful minutes she believed it to be no more than fnendvhi 
ifbut whatever might really be its limits it was enough when perceived by his sister to make her energy 
and it the same time which was still more common to make her uncivil 
she took the first opportunity of aﬂ'ronting her mother-in-law on the occasion talking to her so expressively of her brothers gout expectation of mrs ferrars’s resolution that both her sons should marry well and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to draw pin in that mrs wood could neither pretend to he unconscious nor endeavour to be calm

marked her contempt and instantly left the room 
resolving that whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a retreat her beloved eleanor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations this state of her spirit a letter was delivered to her from the post which contained a proposal particularly well-timed 
it was the offer of a small hours on very easy terms belonging to a relation of her own a gentleman of consequence and property in devoirs 
the letter was from this gentleman himself and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation 
he understood that she was in need of a dwelling and though the house he now entered her was merely a cottage he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary if the situation pleased her 
he earnestly pressed her after giving the particulars of the house and garden to come with her daughters to pardon park the lace of his own residence from whence the might judge herself whether baron cottage for the houses were in the some parlour could by any alteration be made comfortable to her 
he seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style at could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin 
more especially at a moment when she was sinking under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections 
she needed no time for delibcmtinn or inquiry 
her a solution was formed as she read 
the situation of parson in a county so far distant from uses a devonxhire which but a few hours before would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every blue advantage belonging to the place war now its met recommendation

it was a blessing in comparison of the misery of continuing sense and sensibility her daughter 
was guest and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress

the house too as described by sir john was on so simple a scale and the rent so uncommonly moderate as to leave her no right of objection on either point 
and therefore though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy though it was a removal from the vicinity of scotland beyond her wishes she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending her letter of acquiescence

or sooner was her answer despatched than mrs dashed indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife that she was unprovided with a house and should incommoded them no longer than till everything were read for her inhabit it 
they heard her with s pride 
like john dashed said nothing 
but her husband civilly that she would not be settled far from morland

she concluded with a very kind invitation to mr and my john daahwood to visit her at baron 
and to edward the gave one with still greater affection 
though her late conversation with her day father-in-law had made her resolve on remaining at morland no longer than wan unavoidable it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally ended

no difficulty arose on either side in the agreement 
and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at ireland and to determine her future household before she set all for the west 
and this as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her was soon done 
— the horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his duty and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter 
for the come forth of her children had she consulted only her own wishes she would have kept it 
but the discretion of liquor prevailed 
her wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three 
two maids and a man with whom they were speedily divided from amongst those who sinned their estates banishment st morland 
the man and one of the maids were sent of immediately into derbyshire to prepare the house for their distress arrival 
for as lady middle was entirely unknown to mrs dashed she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at baron park 
and she relied so doubtingly on sir john describe

her ear eagerness to be gone from morland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the roof act of her removal 
a satisfaction which was but lee ye attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure

art park was about half a mile from the cottage 
the ladies had passed near it on their way along the valley but it was screened from their view at home by the protection of m hill 
the house was large and handsome 
and the middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance 
the former was for sir john gratification the latter for that of his lady 
they were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood 
it was necessary to the happiness of both 
for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which contained the employments unconnected with such as society produced within a very narrow compass 
sir john was a sportsmen lady middle a mother 
he hunted and shot and she humoured her children 
and these were their only resources 
lady middle had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round while sir john independent employments were in existence only half the time 
continual engage events at home and abroad however supplied all the decencies of nature and education 
supported the good spirits of sir john and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife 
lady middle piqued herself upon the elegance of her table and of all her domestic amusement 
and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties 
but sir john satisfaction in society was much more real 
he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold and the noise they were the better was he 31 sense and sinsibili'i'v 
pleased 
he was a blessing so all the venice part of the neighbourhood for in summer he was for ever forming parties to out cold ham and chicken out of doors and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not muttering under the inestimable appetite of fifteen 
the arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitant 
he had now procured for his cottage at baron 
the miss daubwoods were young 
pretty and unaffected 
it was enough to secure his good of inn for to be unaﬂ'eued was all that a pretty girl you d want to make her mind as captivating as her person 
the friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating taller whose situation might be considered in comparison with the past an unfortunate 
in showing kindness to his cousins therefore 
he had the real satisfaction of a good heart 
and in settling a family of females only in his cottage he had all the satisfaction of a sportsmen 
for a sportsmen though he esteem on 
those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise is not of cox desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor 
mrs dashed and her daughters were met at the door of the house by sir john who welcomed them to pardon park with unabated sincerity 
and as he attended them to the drawing-room repented to the young ladies the concern which the am subject had drawn from him the day before at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them 
they would lee he said only one gentleman there besides himself 
a particular friend who was staying at the park but who was neither very young nor very gay 
he hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party and could assure them it should never happen so again 
he had sense and sensibility 
31 been to several families that morning in of procure some addition to their number 
t it was moon might and even body wan full of engagements 
luckily lady i elton's mother had arrived at baron within the last hour and as she we a very cheerful agreeable woman he hoped the young ladies would not and it so very dull as they might imagine 
the young ladies as well as their mother were perfectly ye satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party and wished for no more 
mrs beginnings lady middleton’s mother was a good-humoured merry fat elderly woman who talked a great deal seemed very happy and rather vulgar 
she was full of jokes and laughter and before dinner was over had said many witty thing the subject of lovers and husbands 
hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in guesses and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not 
marriage was vexed at it for her sisters sake and turned her eyes towards eleanor to see how she bore these attacks with an earnestness which gave eleanor far more pain than could arise from such common-place miller at mrs jennings’s 
colonel grandson the friend of sir john seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend than lady middle was to be his wife or my bearings to be lady middleton’s mother 
he was silent and grave 
his 2 france however was not unpleasing in spite of tall being in the opinion of marriage and margaret an absolute old bachelor for he was on the wrong side of five-and-thirty 
but thou he his face was not handsome his countenance was noon e and his address was particularly gentlemanlike 
there was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them a companions to the dashwoods 
but the cold insipidity of lady middle was so part 
c 14 sense and sensibility 
particularly repulsive that in comparison of it the gravity of colonel branch and even the boiaoemua north of sir john and hit mother-in-law was intending 
lady middle seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the enhance of her four noisy children after dinner who pulled her about tire her clothes and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves 
in the evening as marriage was discovered to be musical she was invited to play 
the instrument was unlocked everybody prepared to be charmed and marriage who can very well at their rev neat went through the chief of the son i which lady skeleton had brought into the family on her marriage and which perhaps had lain ever trace in the name poison on the pianoforte 
for her lad ship had celebrated that event by giving up music though by her mother s account the had plea end extremely well and by her own was very fond of it 
marines performance was highly applied 
sir john was loud in his admiration at the end of every inn and as loud in his conversation with the other while every tone lasted 
lady middle frequently called him to order wondered how any one attention could be diverted from music for a moment and asked marines to lift a particular song which marriage had just ﬁnilhcd 
colonel grandson alone of all the party heard her without being in raptures 
he paid her on ye the compliment of attention 
and the felt a manner for him on the occupation which the other had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste 
his leisure in music though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own wan estimable when contrasted against the horrible sensibility of the others 
and the was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five-and-thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite guns and senstnrm'v 
as power of enjoyment 
she perfectly disposed to make every chance for the colonel advanced state of life which humanity required 
than 1791 
as beginnings wan a widow with an ample jointure 
she had only two daughters both of whom the had lived to alice respectably married and the had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world 
in the promotion of this object she wan zealously active as far an her inability reached and missed no opportunity of projecting wedding among all the young pen e of her acquaintance 
she was remarkably quick in discovery of attachment and had enjoyed the advantage of raining the blue and the vanity of many a young lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man 
and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at button decisively to pronounce that colonel branch was very much in love with minute dashed 
she rather suspected it to be no on the very first evening of their being together from his listening to attentively while she sang to them 
and when the visit wan returned by the middletons dining at the cottage the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again 
it fun 
be so 
she was perfectly convinced of it 
it would be an excellent match for b was rich and as wan handsome 
mrs beginnings had been anxious to see colonel grandson well married ever since her connection with sir john first brought him to her know

and she was always anxious to get a good husband 5 every pretty girl 
the immediate advantage to herself wan by no means 16 sense and smsrnru'rv 
inoonsidmble for it applied her with endless jokes against them both 
at the park she laughed at the colonel and in the cottage e at variance 
to the former her ramble was up by as far as it only himself exactly indifferent 
but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible 
and when its object was understood the hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity or censure its impertinence for the considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel advanced years and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor 
mrs dashed who could not think a man ever years younger than herself so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter ventured to clear mrs beginnings from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age 
a but at least woman you can not deny the absurdity of the accusation though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured 
colonel grandson is certainly younger than mrs beginnings but he is old enough to my father 
and if he were ever animated enough to be in love must have long outlived every sensation of the kind 
it is too ridiculous 
when is a man to be safe from each wit if age and enormity will not project him 3 “inﬁrmit i said eleanor 
do you call colonel random in run 
i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother 
but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs 
a did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism 
and in not that the commonest infinity of declining life 2

3 mamma you are not doing me justice 
i know very well that colonel grandson is not old enough to make his friends yet 
a retentive of losing him in the corner of nature 
e may live twenty years longer 
but thirty-one has nothing to do with matrimony 
perhaps said eleanor 
thirty-one and seventeen had better not have anything to do with matrimony together 
but if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is in life at seven-and-twenty i should not think colonel random being thirty-one any objection to his marrying her 
a woman of seven-and-twenty a said variance after pausing a moment can never hope to feel or inquire affection again 
and if her home be uncommon able or her fortune small i can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse for the sake of the provision and security of a wife 
in his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable 
it would be a compact of convenience and the world would be satisfied 
in my eyes it would be no marriage at all but that would be nothing 
to me it would seem only a commerce exchange in which each wished to be seated at the expense of the other it would be impossible i know a replied eleanor to convince you that a woman of seven-and 
twenty could feel for a man of thirty-one anything near enough to love to make him a desirable come on to her 
but i much object to your coming cow angel branch and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber merely because he chanced to complain yesterday a very cold damp day of a alight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders

we have now been here almost a fortnight

nothing but real and tom could occasion this extraordinary delay 
hat else can detain him at morland 2 had you any idea of his coming so soon 
said my dashed 
i had none 
on the contrary if i have felt any anxiety at all on the subject 
it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation when i talked of his coming to pardon 
does eleanor expect him already -5 
i have never mentioned it to her 
but of wine she must

what can be the meaning of it 
but the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable

he dashwoods were now settled at baron with tolerable comfort to themselves 
the house and the garden with all the objects surrounding them were now become familiar 
and the ordinary pure suits which had given to scotland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than morland had been able to afford since the loss of their father 
sir john middle who called on them every day for the first fortnight and who was not in the habit of seeing much occur actions at home could not conceal his amazement on making them always employed 
their visitors except those from parson dark were not many 
for in spite of sir john s up t entreaties that they would mix more in the being food and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service the independent of mrs dashwood’s spirit overcame the wish of society for her children 
and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk 
there were but few who could be so classed 
and it was not all of them that were attainable 
about a mile and a half from the cottage along the narrow winding valley of allen which issued from that of baron as formerly described the ground in one of their earliest walks discovered an ancient no sense and swsmru'n 
respectable-looking mansion 
which by reminding them a little of scotland interested their inclination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it 
but they learnt on in airs that in possessor an elderly lady of very g character was unfortunately too farm to mix with the world and never mind from home 
the whole country about them abound in beautiful walks 
the high down which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their comments were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valley beneath shut up their superior beauties 
and towards one of these hills did marriage and margaret one remarkable morning direct their steps attracted by the partial sunshine of a shower sky and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned 
the weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book in spite of marines s declaration that the day would be wasting fair and that every threatening cloud would be drawn of 
from their hills 
and the two girls set all together 
they gain ascended the down rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky and when they caught in their faces the animating gale of a high south-easterly wind they pitied the fear which had prevented their mother and finer from sharing such delightful sensations 
2 is there a felicitous in the world said variance superior to this

and they pursued their way against the wind missing it with laughing delight or about twenty minutes longer when suddenly the clouds united over their heads and a driving rain set full in their faces

4 chagrin and so raised they were obliged though unwillingly to turn cake for no shelter was nearer than their own house 
one consolation however remained for them to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety 
it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate 
they set off 
marriage had at first the advantage but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground and margaret unable to stop herself to assist her was involuntarily hurried along and reached the bottom in so 
gentleman carrying a gun with two points playing round him was passing up the hill and within a few yards of marriage when her accident happened 
he put down his en and ran to her assistance 
she had raised herself worn the ground but her foot had been twisted in the fall and she was scarcely able to stand 
the gentleman offered his services and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered nieces 
mary took her up in his arms without farther delay and carried her down the hill 
then passing through the garden the gate of which had been left open by margaret he bore her directly into the house whither margaret as just arrived and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour 
liquor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance and while the eyes of that were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprang from his appearance he apologised for his intrusion by relating its cause in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person which was uncommonly handsome received additional charms from his voice and expression

more than common graceful were instantly the theme of general admiration and the laugh which his gallantry failed against variance received particular spirit from his exterior attraction variance herself had seen tens of hit pen than the rest for the confusion which crimson over her face on his lifting her up had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house 
but the had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others and with an energy which always adorned her praise 
hit person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite itor 
and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality there was a rapidity of thou hat which particularly recommended the action to her

sir john called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of sense and sensibility 
of doors 
and marianne’a accident being related to him he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of willoughby at allen 
“willoughbyl

i do not know much about him as to all back but he is a pleasant goodhumoured fellow and has got the nicest little black pitch of a point i ever saw

but variance could no more satisfy him as to the colour of mr willoughby’s later than he could describe to her the shades of is mind 
but who is he 
a said eleanor 
a where does he come from 
has he a house at allen 
a on this point sir john could give more certain intelligence 
and he told them that mr willoughby had no property of his own in the country 
that he resided there only while he was visited the old lady at allen court to whom he was faded and whose stones he was to inherit 
adding a yes yes he is very well worth catching i can tell you miss catchword

you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic 
another meeting will suffer to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty and second running and then you can have nothing farther to ask 
a a minor 1 cried variance 2 is this fair 
is this just 
are my ideas so scanty 
but i see what you mean 
i have been too much at my ease too ha by too frank 
i have erred against every common acre notion of decorum 
i have been open and sincere where i on hit to have been reserved spiritless dull and deceit 
had i walked only of the weather and the roads and had i spoken only once in ten minutes this reproach would have been spared my love a said her mother you must not be offended with eleanor 
hat was only in i should scold her myself if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friends marriage was softened in a moment 
willoughlry on his side gave every roof of his leisure in their acquaintance which an evil end which of improving it could offer 
he came to them every day 
to inquire after marriage was at first his excuse 
but the encouragement of his reception to which every day gave greater kindness made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible by marianne'u perfect recovery 
she was confined for some days to the house but never had any confinement been less irksome 
willoughby was a young man 8 laws and sensram-rv 
of good abilities quick imagination lively spirits and open affectionate manners 
he was exactly formed to engage marines heart 
for with all this he joined not only a captivating person but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the exact leg of her own and which recommended him to her soon beyond everything else 
his society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment they read they talked they sang together 
his musical talents were considerable 
and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which edward had unfortunately wanted 
in mrs dashwood’s estimation he was as faultless as in marines 
and finer saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister of saying too much what he thought on every occasion without attention to persons or circumstances 
in hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly proof gaiety he displayed a want of caution which eleanor con d not approve in spite of all that he and marriage could say in its sup rut 
variance began now to perceive that ll desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection had been rash and unjustifiable 
willoughby was all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every brighter period as capable of attaching her 
and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that red act as men as his abilities were strong 
her brother too in whose mind not one speculate thought of their marriage had been raised by his prospect of riches was led before the end of a week to hope and expect it and secretly to congratulate herself sense and sensibility 
4 on having gained two such sons-in-law as edward and willoughby 
colonel brandon’s partiality for marriage which had so early been discovered by his friends now first became perceptible to minor when it ceased to be noticed by them 
their attention and wit were drawn on to his more fortunate rival 
and the raillery which the other had incurred before any partiality arose was removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility 
editor was obliged though unwillingly to believe that the stem 
many which mrs beginnings had designed him for her own satisfaction were now actually excited by her sister 
and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of mr willoughby an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the red rid of colonel grandson 
she saw it with concern 
or what could a silent man of five-and-thirty hope when exposed by a very lively one of five-and-twenty 
and as she could not even wish him successful she hurt wished him indifferent 
she liked him 
in spite of his gravity and reserve she beheld in him an object of interest 
his manners though serious were mild 
and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloonriness of lee 
sir john had dropped hints of past injuries and appointments which sustained her belief of his being an unfortunate man and she regarded him with respect and compassion 
perhaps she tried and esteemed him the more because he was signed by willoughby and marriage who prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young seemed resolved to undervalue his merits 
a branch is just the kind of man a said willoughby one day when they were talking of him together when everybody speaks well of and nobody cares i 
d no sense and sensibility 
about 
whom all are delighted to see and nobody remember to talk to that it exactly what i think him cried variance 
do not boat of it however a laid eleanor for it is injustice in both of you 
he in highly mute all the family at the park and i never see him in without taking paint to converse with him 
2 that he in patronised by him lived willoughhy la certainly in all favour 
but for the esteem of the others it in a reproach in itself 
who would admit to the indignity of being approved by such women as lady middle and my denying that could command the indifference of anybody ll 2 1 but perhaps the blue of such people as yourself and marriage will make amends or the regard of lady middle and her mother 
if their la censure your censure may be praise 
for they are not more undiaccrning than you ate prejudiced and unjust 
in defence of your prove you can even be saucy

yes variance even in a man between this and forty 
he has been 3 great deal of the world

i have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects and he had always answered my inquiries with the readiness of good-breeding and good-nature that is to say a cried variance contemptible he has told you that in the e induce the climate in hot and the mosquitoes are troublesome

i consider him on the contrary as a very respectable man who ha everybody

chapter 13 
little had an wood or her daughter imagined when they came light into devonahire that so many engagement would arise to on a their time as shortly presented themselves or that they should have such frequent invitations and such come visitors an to leave them little leisure for serious employment 
yet such was the case 
when marriage was recovered the schemes of amusement at home and abroad which sir john had been seriously forming were put in execution 
the private ill at the park then began 
and articles on the water were made and accomplished as of ten at a shower october would allow 
in every meeting of the kind willoughby want included 
and the case and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give incrmu'ng intimacy to his acquaintance with the daehwoodt to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellence 
of marines of marking his animated admiration of her and of receiving in her behaviour to himself the most pointed assurance of her affection 
liquor could not be surprised at their attachment 
she only wished that it were less openly shown and once or twice did venture to suggest the prey of come self-command to marriage 
but variance abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve 
and to aim at the restraints of sentiment which were not in themselves audible appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions 
willoughby thought the same 
and their behaviour at all times was an illustration of their opinions 
when he was present the had no eye for any one sense and sensibilities 
if else 
everything he did was right 
everything he did was clever 
if their evenings at the park were concluded with cards he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand 
if dancing formed the amusement of the night they were partners for half the time 
and when obliged to separate flora couple of dances were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke in word to anybody else 
such conduct made them of course most exceedingly lad had at 
but ridicule could not shame and seemed hare ye to provoke them 
mrs dashed entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them 
to her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind 
this was the season of happiness to marriage 
her heart was devoted to willoughby and the fond attachment to scotland which she brought with her from sex was more likely to he softened than she had thought it possible before by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home 
a errors happiness was not so great 
her heart was not so much at ease nor her satisfaction in their amusementssopure 
the adored her no come notion that could make amends or what she had left hand nor that could teach her to think of ireland with less regret than ever 
neither lady middle nor my bearings could sup lay to her the conversation she missed 
although e latter was an everlasdng talker and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which insulted her a large share of her discourse 
she had already led her own history to minor three or four times 
and had eleanor's memory been equal to her means of improvement she might have known very early in her acquaintance all the particulars of mr jennings’s last 4 sense and sinslbllﬂ'v 
illness and what he laid to hit wife a few minutes before he died 
lady middle was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent 
liquor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve wan a mere calmness of manner with which came had nothing to do 
towards her husband and mother the wan the same as to them 
and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired 
she had nothing to lay one day that she had not said the day before 
her rapid 
it was invariable for even her spirit were always the same 
and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband provided everything were conducted in after and her two eldest children attended her she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in getting at home 
— 
and so little did her presence add to the plea of the others by any chin in their action that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys 
in colonel grandson alone of all her new acquaintance did editor and a prison who could in any degree claim the respect of linen excite the interest of friendship or give pleasure an a companion 
willing was out of the question 
her admiration and red even her miserly regard wan all his own but he won a lover 
his attention were wholly variance and a far less agreeable man might have been more general pleasing 
colonel grandson unfortunately for himself had no such encouragement to think only of marriage and in conversing with minor he found the greatest consolation for the total indifference of her finger 
eliza companion for him increased as he had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known by him 
this suspicion was given by some word which accidentally dropt from him sense a 
sensibility 
one evening at the park when they were sitting down together b mutual consent whip e the others were dancing eyes were fixed on marriage and after a silence of some minutes he said with a faint smile 1 your sister i understand does not approve of second attachments 1 no replied eleanor 
a her opinions are all romantic 1 or rather as i believe she considers them impossible to exist 1 i believe she does 
but how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father who had him two wives i know not 
a few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation 
and then they may be more easy to dine and to than they now are by an my but herself a hill will probably be the case he replied 
and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions 
a i can not agreed with you there a said eleanor 
there are inconveniences attending such feelings as marines which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for 
her eyes have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought 
and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forward to as her greatest possible advantage after a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying 
a does your sister make no distinction in her objections a just a second attachment 
or is it equally criminal in everybody 
are those who have been disappointed in their first choice whether from the inconstancy of its object or the perverseness of circumstances to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives 2 1 ay sir 
and sensibility 
upon my word 
i am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles 
i only know think i never yetheordher admit any more of mood attachment i being pardonable 
within a said he a can not 
hold 
but i change 
a total change of moment 
no 
no do not done it 
for when the romantic refinement of a young mind are obliged to give way how frequently are they intended by such opinion as are but too common and too dangerously i speak from experience 
i once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly notch 5 sister who thought and judged like her but who am an enforced change 
from a series of unfortunate circumstances 
— here he stopped suddenly 
appealed to think that he had said too much and by his countenance gave rise to conjecture 
which might not otherwise have entered eleanor's paul 
the lad would probably have rated without suspicion in he not convinced mix wood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips 
or it was it required but a alight effort of fancy to connect hit emotion with the tender recollection of past regard 
liquor a no more 
but arrange in her place would not have done so little 
the whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination and everything emblilhed in the most melancholy order of dimatrour love 
chapter 13 
s editor and marriage were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of new to her visitor which in spite of all that he knew before of marianne'r imprudence and want of thought surprised her by it extravagant testimony of sense and sensibility 
both 
variance told her with the greatest delight that willoughby had given her a horse one that he and bred himself on his estate in somersetshire and which was exactly calculated to any a woman 
without considering that it was not in her mother s plan to keep any one 
that if the were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift she must buy another for the servant and keep a servant to ride it and after all build a stable to receive them 
the had accepted the present without hesitating and told her sister of it in rapture 
he intends to send his groom into somersetshire immediately for it she added and when it arrived we will ride every day 
you shall share its use with me 
imagine to yourself my dear eleanor the delight of a all on some of these gowns 
most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to tom reached all the unhappy truths which attended the a air and for some time she resigned to submit to them 
as to an additional servant the expense would be a trifle 
command the was sure would never object to it 
and any horse would do for in 
he might always get one at the park 
as to a simple the merest shed would be sufficient 
liquor then ventured to doubt the proof gaiety of her receiving such a present from a man so lit e or at least so lately known to her 
this was too much 
you are mistaken eleanor 1 aid the warm 
in supposing i know very little of 
willoughby 
have not known him long indeed but i am much better acquainted with him than i am with any other creature in the world except yourself and moral 
it is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy 
— it is disposition alone 
seven years would be inwﬂicient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven days are more than enough for others 
i should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a 8 sense and sensibility 
home from my brother than from willoughhy 
of john i know very little though we have lived together for years 
but of willoughhy my judgment has long been formed eleanor thought it 
wisest to touch that point no more 
she knew her sisters temper 
opposition on so tender 2 subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion 
but by an appeal to her affection for her mother by representing the inconvenience which that indulgent mother must draw on herself if as would probably be the case she contented to this increase of establishment marriage was shortly subdued 
and she promised not to turn t her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the other and to tell willoughby when the saw him next that it must he declined 
she was faithful to her word 
and when willoughby called at the cottage the tame day eleanor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present 
the reasons for this alteration were at the same time related and they were such as to make further enemy on his side impossible 
his concern however was very apparent 
and after ox resting it with earnestness he added in the same low voice 
a but marriage the horse ll still yours though you can not use it now 
i shall keep it only till you can claim it 
when you leave baron to ever your own establishment in a more lasting 
home queen male shall receive on 
my this was all overheard by miss dashed 
and in the whole of the sentence in his manner of pronouncing it and in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone she instantly saw an intimacy 10 decided a meaning so direct at marked a perfect agreement between them 
from that moment she doubted not sense and smxruurv 
s. of their being engaged to each other 
and the belief of it created no other rise than that the or any of their friend should be left by temper no frank to recover it by accident 
margaret related something to her the next day which placed this matter in a still clearer light 
willingly had spent the preceding evening with them and margaret by being left come time in the parlour with only him and prince had had opportunity for observations which with a most important face the communicated to her eldest linger when they were next by themselves 
of liquor 1 she cried 
i have such a secret to tell you about marriage 
i am cure the will be married to mr willoughby very soon 
you have laid to a replied eleanor almost every day since they burst met on high-church down and the had not known each other a week i believe here you were certain that meantime wore his nature round her neck 
but it turned out to be any the miniature of our great-uncle 
a but indeed thin in quite another thing 
i am nun they will he married very soon for he has got a lock of her hair take care margaret 
it may be only the hair of some great-uncle of bit 
a but indeed plainer it in marriage s 
i am almost sure it is for i saw him out it on 
last night after tea when you and mamma went out of the room were whispering and talking together up an as could be and he seemed to be begging something of her and presently he took up her scissors and cut of a long lock of her hair for it was all tumbled down her back 
and he kissed it and folded it up in a piece of white paper and put it into his pocket-book from such particular stated on such authority to since and sensibility 
liquor could not withhold her credit nor was she disposed to it for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself 
margaret sagacity was not always imaged in a way so satisfactory to her sister 
when as beginnings attacked her one evening at the park to give the name of the young man who was eleanor s particular favourite which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her margaret answered by looking at her sister and saying i must not tell may i eleanor 
this of course made everybody laugh 
and finer tried to laugh too 
but the effort was painful 
she was convinced that margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with mrs beginnings 
variance felt for her most sincerely 
but she did more harm than good to the cause by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to margaret 
a remember that whatever your conjectures may be you have no right to repeat them i never had any conjectures about it replied margaret 
it was you who told me of it yourself 
this increased the mirth of the company and margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more 
oh 
pray miss margaret let us know all about it said mrs beginnings 
what is the gentleman's name i must not tell ma'am 
but i know very well what it is 
and i know where he is too 
a yes yes we can guess where he is 
at his own house at morland to be sure 
he is the curate of the parish i dare say not sum 
he is not 
he is of no profession at all 
margaret a said marriage with great warmth sense and sensibility 
6 
you know that all this is an invention of your own and that there is no such person in existence 
well then he is lately dead arrange for i am sure there was such a man once and his name begins with an f most grateful did eleanor feel to lady middle for observing at this moment 2 that it rained very hard a though she believed the interruption to proceed less from an attention to her than from her lad ships great die like of all such inelegance subjects of rain cry as delighted her husband and mother 
the idea however started by her was immediately pursued by colonel grandson who was on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others 
and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them 
willoughby opened the pianoforte and asked marines to sit down to it 
and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic it fell to the ground 
but not so easily did eleanor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her 
a party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very line place about twelve miles from parson belonging to a brother-in-law of colonel grandson without whose interest it 
could not be seen as the proprietor who was then abroad had left strict orders on that head 
the grounds were declared to be highly beautiful and sir john who was clearly warm in their praise might be allowed to a tolerable judge for he had formed parties to visit them at least twice every summer for the last ten years 
they contained a noble piece of water 
a sail on which wan to form a great part of the mornings amusement 
cold provisions were to be taken open carriage only to be employed and everything conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure 
2 sense and sensibility 
to some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking 
considering the time of year and that it had rained every day for the lane fortnight 
— and my danhwood who had already a cold was persuaded by eleanor to stay at home 
then off 
heir intended exception to whiten turned out very differently from what liquor had expected 
she was prepared to be wet through fatigued and fro hastened 
but the event was still more unfortunate or they did not go at all 
by ten o'clock the whole party were assembled at the park where they were to breakfast 
the morning was rather favourable e though it had mind all night i 
the clouds were then dispersing across the city and the inn frequently appeared 
they were all in high spirits good humour eager to be happy and determined to submit to the greater 
convenience and hardship rather than be otherwise 
while they were at breakfast the letter were brought in 
among the rent there wan one for colonel grandson 
— he took it looked at the direction changed colour and immediately left the room 
a what in the matter with grandson -5 laid sir john 
nobody could tell i hope he has had no bad news laid lady middle 
a it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel grandson leave my breakfast-table to suddenly in about ever minute he returned 
a no bad news colonel i hope 3 
said men running as noon at he entered the room 
sense and sensmu'rv 
by a none at all ma'am i thank you 
two it from vision 
i hope it in not any that your sister in worse 
a no main 
it came from town and in merely a letter of business 
v but how came the hand to discompose you in much if it was only a letter of business 
come come this wo n't do colonel 
so let us hear the truth of it no i a a my dear madam a said lady middle 1 recollect what you are no single a weight it up to tell you that your cousin fanny in married 2 a said mrs beginnings without attending to her daughter rev roof 
a no indeed it in not a a well then i know who it in from colonel

a whom do you mean ma'am 2 mild he colouring a little 
oh

i am particularly sorry ma'am said he addressing lad middle 2 that i should receive thin letter today 5 it in on business which requires my immediate attendance in town 
in town i 
cried my bearings 
what can you have to do in town at thin time of year 
a my own lose in great a he continued a in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party 
but i am the more concerned as i fear my presence in necessary to gain our admittance at white 
hat a blow upon them all was thin 
but if you write a note to the housekeeper mr grandson laid variance eagerly a will it not be sufficient 
a he shook his head 
we must go laid sir john 
it shall not be of sense and sensibility 
nut ill when we are so near it 
you can not go to town till to 
morrow branch that in all i wish it could be no sin nettled 
but it in not in my power to delay my journey after one day 
a life you would but let know what your business is said mr beginnings 2 we might see whether it could be put of or not a you would not be six hours later laid willoughby 1 if you were to defer your journey till our return i can not afford to lose an hour 
liquor then heard willoughby say in a low voice to arrange a there are some pack who moor 
bear a party of pleasure 
london is one of them 
he wan afraid of catching cold i dare say and invent thin trick for getting out of it 
i would lay fifty guinea 
the letter was of his own writing a i have no doubt of it a replied variance 
there it no persuading you to change your mind pardon i know of old a said sir john 
a when once you are determined on anything 
but however i hope on will think better of it 
consider here are the two lain carry come over from mention the three mile dnahwoods walked up from the cottage and mr willoughby got into hours before his usual time on put as to a to hitwell.” lovely moon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of deep winning the party but at the nine time declared it to let unavoidable 
a well then when will you come back again i hope we shall see you at baron added her lad ship 1 at noon at you can conveniently leave town 
an we must put or the party to whiten till you returned a you are very obliging 
but it in no uncertain when i may have it in my power to return that i dare not engage for it at all sense and sensibility 
as a oh he knelt and shall come back a cried sir john 
a if he in not here by the end of the week i shall go after him 
ay if do sir john cried my bearings 
and then that you may end out what his burden in 
a do not want to pray into other unconcern i up he it it something he in ashamed of colonel brandon’a home were announced 1 you do not go to town on horseback do you i 
added sir john 
no 
only to him 
i shall then go poet 
a well as you are resolved to go i wish you a good journey 
but you had exchange your mind 
i nature you it in not in my power 
he then took leave of the whole party 
a in there no chance of my seeing you and your finger in town thin winter maria 
dashed i i am afraid none at all 
then i must bid you farewell for a longer time than i could with to do to marriage he merely bowed and said nothing 
come colonel said mr 
joining before you go do let us know what you are going about 
he wished her a good morning and attended by sir john let the room 
the complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto restrained now burst forth universally 
and othersall agreed again and again how provoking it war to so disappointed 
i can guess what his business in however a laid my bearings exultingly 
can you ma'am 
said almost everybody 
a yet 
it is about in millions i am m 
2 and who in miss william 
asked variance 
what 
do you not know who miss william in 
i am sure you must have heard of her before 
she is i. e of sense and smsrnru'rv. a relation of the colonel my dear 
a near relation 
we will not say how near for m of shocking the young ladies then lowering her voice a little she said to minor she in his natural daughter 
a indeed 
oh 
yes 
and as like him as she can stare 
i dare any the colonel will leave her all his fortunes when sir john returned he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event 
concluding however by observing that as they were all got together they must do something by way of being happy 
and after some consultation it was agreed that although happiness could only he enjoyed at white 
they might procure a tolerably composure of mind by driving about the country 
the carriages were then ordered 
willoughby’n was lit and marriage never looked ha pier than when the out into it 
he drove through time part very fast an they were soon out of sight 5 and nothing more of them we seen till their return which did not happen till after the return of all the rent 
they both seemed delighted with their drive but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes while the others went on the down 
it was settled that there should be a dance in the evening and that everybody should be extremely merry all day long 
some more of the days came to dinner and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table which sir john observed with great contentment 
willoughby took his moral place between the two elder miss dashwooda 
my bearings hat on elinor‘a right hand 
and they had not been long seated before the leant behind her and willoughby and said to marriage loud enough for them both to hear if have found you out in spite of all your tricks 
i know where you spent the morning 
sense all angry 
by marriage coloured and replied very hastily 1 where in i a 
up did not you know a aid willoughby that we had been out in my curricle 1 yes yes mr impudence i know that very well and i wan determined to and out where on had been to 
i hare you like your home in reliance 
it in a very large one i know and when i come to see you i hope you will have new-fumiuhed it for it wanted it very much when i was there six year a 2 
variance turned away in great confusion 
my bearings laughed heartily 
and finer found that in her resolution to know where they had been he had actually made her own woman inquire of mr willaughhy’r groom and that the had by that method been informed that they had gone to allen and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house 
liquor could hardly believe this to be true a it seemed likely that fellow he should m or maxim consent to enter the home while smith was in it with whom marriage had not the valley acquaintance 
a 
soon as they left the dining-room eleanor inquired of her about it 
and great vex her surprise when the found that every circumstance related by man leaning was perfectly true 
variance wan quite an my with her for doubting it 
why should you imagine eleanor that we did not go there or that we did not see the house 
ii not it what on have often wished to do yourself 
a s marriage but i would not go while smith way there and with no other companion than mr willoughby 
mr willoughhy however in the only person who by sense and sunsrolu'rv 
can have a right to draw that home 
and wet in an open foliage it we impossible to have any other come union 
i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life 
i am afraid 1 replied plainer than the plenumneea of an employment doze 
not always evince its propriety 
on the contrary nothing can be a stronger proof of it eleanor 
for if there had been arrear impropriety in what i did i should have been sensible of it at the time for we always know when we are acting wrong and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure 1 but my dear arrange a it has already explained on to some very impertinent remarks do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct 
if the impertinent remarks of mrs beginnings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct we are all offending every moment of all our lives 
i value not her censure any more than i should do her commend ton 
i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mr 
sighs round or in seeing her home 
they will one day be mr willoughby'u and 
— a if they were one do to be your own arrange you would not be justified in what you have done 
she blushed at thin hint 
but it was even waiting gratifying to her 
and after a ten minutes interval of earnest thought she came to her inner again and laid with great good humour perhaps plainer it war rather ill-judged in me to go to allen 
but mr willoughby wanted particularly to allow me the place 
and it is a charming home i assure you 
there in one remarkably pretty sitting-room upstairs of a nice comfortable size for compact made and with modern future it would be delightful 
it is a corner room guns and snusrnxurv 
by and has windows on two sides 
on one side you look roll the bowling-green behind the house to a beautiful hanging wood 
and on the other have a view of the church and village and on them of those fine hold hills that we have so of admired 
i did not see it so advance for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture 
but if it were newly fitted up 
of couple of hundred pounds willoughby says would make it one of the pleasantest supper-room in england could eleanor have listened to her without interruption from the others she would have described every room in the house with equal delight 
hum 17 
he sudden termination of colonel ardours visit at the park with his steadiness in concealing its cause filled the mind and raised the wonder of mrs bearings for two or three days she was a great wonder as ever one must be who takes a very lively interest in the coming and goings of all their acquaintance 
she wondered with little intermission what could he the reason of it 
was sure there must be some bad news and thou hat over every kind of distress that could have belle en him with a fixed determination that he should not escape them all 
something very melancholy must be the matter i am sure a said she 
i could see it in his face 
poor man 
i am afraid his circumstances may he had 
the same at delal‘ord was never reckoned more than two thousand a year and his brother left everything sadly involved 
i do think he must have been sent for about to sense and sensibilities 
money matters for what else can it be 
i wonder whether it is no 
i would give anything to know the truth of it 
perhaps it is about miss alland by the bye i dare say it it became he looked in conscious when i mentioned her 
may she it ill in town 
nothing in the world more likely for i have a notion the is always a rather sickly 
i would lay any wages it is about in millions 
it is not so very likely he should be distressed in hit circumstanced am for he is a very prudent man and to be cure me have cleared the male b full time 
i wonder what it can be 
make his sister is wore at vision so ha sent for him over 
hit setting off in such hurry seems very like it 
well i wish him out of all hit trouble with all my heart and a good wife into the bargain so wondered so talked mrs beginnings 
her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture and all seeming equally probable as they arose 
liquor though she felt really interested in the welfare of colonel grandson could not bestow all the wonder on his going to suddenly away which man leaning was desirous of her feeling 
for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation her wonder was otherwise disposed of 
it was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and willoughby on the subject 
which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them all 
an this fence continued every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the dim tone of both 
why they should not a only know edge to her mother and herself what their constant behaviour to each other declared to have taken place eleanor could not imagine 
she could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power 
for though willoughby was independent there was no reason to believe him rich 
his estate had been rated by sir john at about ix or sense and sensibility 
7 i seven hundred a year 
but he lived at an xx to which that corner could hardly be equal a he had himself often complained of his 
poverty 
but for thin strange kind of secrecy maintained by them relative to their en event which in fact concealed nothing at all the cow d not account 
and it was no wholly contradictory of their general opinions and practice that a doubt sometimes entered her mind of their being really engaged and this doubt wan enough to prevent her making any inquiry of marines 
nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all then willoughhy’n behaviour 
to arrange it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover heart could give and in the mat of the family it wan the affectionate attention of a m and a brother 
the cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home 
many more of his 
hours were spent there than at allen 
and if no general engagement collected them at the park the exercise which called him out in the morning wan almost certain of ending there where the rest of the day was pen by himself all the tide of marriage and by his favourite pointed at her feet 
one evening in particular about a week aﬂercolonel grandson had felt the country his heart seemed more than usually open to ever feeling of attachment to the objects around him 
an on my duhwood’e happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring he warmly blamed every alteration of a place which affection enahliehed as perfect with him 
what 
a he exclaimed 
a improve this dear cottage 
no 
it i will never consent to 
not a none must be added to its walls not an inch to in rites if my feelings are regarded do not be alarmed aid in daahwood 7 sense and sensibility 
a nothing of the kind will he done 
for my mother will never have no enough to attempt it 
i am he ay glad of it a he cried 
sayshe always s be poor if the can employ her riches no better thank you willoughby 
but you may be assured that i would not sacrifice one sentiment of coals attachment of yours or of anyone whom i loved for all the improvements in the world 
depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain when i make up my accounts in the spring i would even rather la it useless 
by than dispute of it in a manner so ill to you 
light are you really so attached to this alice as to see no defect in it i 
i am a said he 
to me it is spiritless 
nay more i consider it as the only form of building to which happiness is attainable 
and were i rich enough i would instantly pull borne down and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage 
a with dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that strike i suppose said eleanor 
a yes cried he in the same eager tone 1 with all and everything belonging to it 
— in no one convenience or inconvenience about it should the least variation be perceptible 
then and then only under such a most might perhaps be as happy at table as i have been at baron 
a i better myself a replied eleanor 
that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase you will hereafter and your own house as faultless as you now do this 
a there certainly are circumstances said willingly which might greatly endear it to me 
but this place will always have one claim on my affection which no other can any share 
mrs dashed looked with pleasure at variance whose ones eyes were fixed so expressively on sense and smsimurv 
3 willoughby a plainly denoted how well she understood him 
how often did i wish added he 
when i was at allen this same twelvemonth that parson cottage were inhabited 
i never passed within view of it without admiring its situation and grieving that no one should live in it 
how little did i then think that the very first news i should hear from my smith when i next came into the country would be that parson cottage was taken 
and i felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event which nothing but a kind of science of what happens i should experience from it can account for 
must it not have been so marriage i 
speaking to her in a lowered voice 
then continuing his former tone he mad and yet this home you would spoil mrs dalhwood 
you would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement 
and this mr parlour in which our acquaintance hint began and in which so many happier hours have been since not i 
us together you we d disgrace to the condition of a common entrance and everybody would be eager to pass through he the room which has hitherto contained within take more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could poring afford 
my dashed again natured him that no alteration of the kind should be attempted 
you are a good woman 1 he warmly replied 
your promise makes me easy 
extend it a little farther and it will make me happy 
tell me that not only our house will remain the same but that i shall ever and you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling 
and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me 
the promise was readily given and willoughby’u 4 snusr-z and snusrnru'rv 
behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness 
a shall we see you to-morrow to dinner 2 a mind my dashed when he was leaving them 
a i do not ask you to come in the morning for we must walk to the park to call on lady middleton.” he engaged to he with them by four o'clock 
hum 
do 
as dashwood’s visit to lady middle took place the next day and two of her daughter went with her 
but variance excused herself from being of the party under name trifling present of m lament 
and her mother who concluded that a promise had been made in willoughhy the night before of calling on her while they were about 
perfect fatigued with her remaining at home 
on their return me the park they found willoughby’l curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage and my dashed was convinced that her conjecture had been just 
so far it wan all as she had foreseen 
but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect 
they were no sooner in the passage than variance came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent agitation with her handkerchief at her eyes and without noticing them run upstairs 
surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted where they found only willoughby who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his back towards them 
he turned round on their coming in and his countenance showed that he strongly pack of the emotion which overpowered variance 
sense and sensibility 
15 
is anything the matter with her i cried my dashed as she entered 
2 is the ill 
i hope not he replied trying to look cheerful 
and with a forced smile presently added a it is i who may gather expect to be ill 
for i am now muttering under a very heavy disappointment 
damp intent 
a a yes or i am unable to keep my engagement with mrs smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor d eat cousin by sending me on business london 
have just received my despatches and taken my farewell of allen 
and by way of explanation i am now come to take my furcwcl of you 
a a to london 1 
and are you going this morning in a almost this moment 
this is very unfortunate 
but mr smith must be obliged 
and her business will not detain you from us long i hope 
he coloured as he replied a you are very kind but i have no idea of returning into devonlhire immediately 
my visits to mrs smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth 
2 and is mrs smith your only friend 
is allen the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome 
for shame willoughby 
can you wait for an invitation here 2 1 his colour increased 
and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied a you are too good 
my danhwood looked at eleanor with surprise 
liquor felt equal amusement for a few moments every one was silent mrs daahwood first key 
i have only to add my dear wife cough that at baron cottage you will always be welcome 
for i will not press you to return here immediately because you only can judge how far that might be up asking to me my sense and sensibility 
smith 
and on this head i shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclinations 
a my engagements at present a replied willoughby confessedly 
are of such a nature 
that 
i dare not matter myself 
— he stopt 
mrs dashed was too much astonished to speak and another pause succeeded 
this was broken by willnughby 
who said with a faint smile 1 it is folly to linger in this manner 
i will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy he then hastily took leave of them all and left the room 
they saw him step into his carriage and in a minute it was out of sight 
mrs dashed felt too much for speech and instantly quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned 
eleanor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother 
she thought of what had just passed with anxiety and disgust 
willoughby’s behaviour in taking leave of them his embarrassment and agitation of cheerfulness and above all his unwillingness to accept her mother invitation a awkwardness so unlike a lover 
so unlike himself greatly disturbed her 
one moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side 
and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister 
the distress in which marriage had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for 
though when she considered what marines love for him was a quarrel seemed almost am able 
but whatever might be the particular as of their separation her sisters application was indubitable 
and she thought with the tenderest come vision of that violent sorrow which marriage was in all probability not merely guns and sensibility 
my giving way to as relief but feeding and encouraging as a a 
in atlysout half an hour her mother returned and though her eyes were red her countenance was not uncheerful 
a our dear willoughby is now some miles from parson eleanor said she as she sat down in work and with how heavy a heart does he travel i a 
it is all very strange 
so suddenly to be gone 
it seems butcher work of a moment 
and last night was with us so happy so cheerful so affectionate 
and now after only ten minutes notice-gone me without intending to return 
something more than what he owned to us must have happened 
he did not speak he did not behave like himself 
thou must have seen the difference as well up i 
what can it be 
can they have quarrelled why else should he have shown such unwillingness to accept your invitation here 
— a it was not inclination that he wanted eleanor 
i could plainly see ifbut 
he had not the power of accepting it 
i have thought it all over i assure you and i can perfectly account for everything that at rest seemed strange to me as well as to you a can you indeed i 
yes 
i have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way 
— 
but you editor who love to doubt where you can 
it will not satisfy you i know 
but you shall not talk in out of my trust in it 
i am persuaded that mrs smith suspects his regard for marriage disapproved of it 353mm because she has other views for him and on t account is eager to get him away 
— and that the business which she sends him off to transaction is inverted as an excuse to dismiss him 
this is what i believe to have happened 
he is moreover aware that she does disapprove the connexion he dares 8 sense and snusmu'rv 
not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with marriage and he feel himself obliged from his dependent situation to give into her scheme and absent himself from devonahire for a while 
you will tell me i know that thin may or may not have happened 
but i will listen to no cavil unleeeyou can point outcry other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory as this 
and now eleanor what have you to any 
a 
nothing for you have anticipated my only/er.” 1 then you would have told me that it might or might not have happened 
oh 
liquor how incomprehemibk are your feelings 
you had rather take evil upon credit than good 
you had rather look out for misery for marriage and guilt for poor willoughlry than an apology for the latter 
you are resolved to think him blameable became he took leave of us with less objection than his usual behaviour renown 
and is no allowance to be made for inadvertence 
or far spirited departed by recent disappointment 
are no probabilities to be accepted merely became they are not certainthat 
in nothing due to the man whom we have all i 
much reason to love and no mean in the world to think ill of 
to the possibility of motive 
untameable in themselves though unavoidably secret for a while 
and after all what in it you rope him of 
i can hardly tell you myself 
but suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable con fence of such an alteration an we have just wit in him 
there it great truth however in what you have now urged of the allowance 
which ought to be made for him and it it my wish to be candid in my judgment of everybody 
though may undoubtedly have very sufficient runs for his conduct and i vii hope that he hat 
but it would have been more like willoughby to acknowledge them at once 
secrecy my be advisers and sensibility 
7th able 
but still i can not help wondering at its being practised by him a do not blame him however for parting from his character when the deviation is necessary 
but you really do admit the justice of what i have said in his defence 
— i am happy 
and he is acquitted a not entirely 
it may be proper to conceal their engagement if they are engaged from mrs smith 
and if that is the case it must be highly expedient for willoughhy to be but little in devoirs at present but this is no excuse for their concealing it from us 
concealing it from all my dear child do you accuse willoughby and marriage of concealment 
this is strange indeed when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiously 
i want no proof of their affection a said eleanor 
a but of their engagement i do a i am perfectly satisfied of both yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject by either of them 
i have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly 
has not his behaviour to marriage and to all of us for at least the last fortnight declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation 
have we not perfectly understood each other 
has not my consent been daily asked by his looks his manner his attentive and affectionate respect 
my editor is it possible to doubt their engagement 
how could such a thought occur to you 
how is it to he supposed that willoughh persuaded as he must he of your sister love should d leave her and leave her perhaps for months without telling her of his all'ecu'on 
— 
that they should part without a mutual exchange of conﬁdence.” 
i confess 1 replied eleanor that every circuit sense and sensiiiili‘i'v 
dance except one it in favour of an engagement but that an is the total silence of both on the object and with me it almost outweighevery others a how strange this is 
you run think wretchedly indeed of willoughby if after ill that ha openly between them you can doubt the nature the tea on which they are together 
half he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all thin time 
do you in pane him really indigent to her 
a a xi i can not think that 
he must and do 
love her i am sure about with a range kind of gentlemen if he can leave her with such indifference touch careleuneu of the future as you attribute to him 
a you must remember my dear mother that i have never considered thin matter as certain 
i have had my doubts i confess 
but they are fainter than they were and they may noon be entire 
done away 
if we find they correspond every fear of mine will be removed 
a a mighty concession indeed 
if you were to see them at the altar you would suppose that they were going to be married 
ungracious girl i but i require no luck roof 
nothing in my opinion ha ever paused to justify doubt 
no secrecy ha 
been attempted 5 all has been uniformly open and unreserved 
you can not doubt your sister wishes 
it must be willoughby therefore whom you expect 
but why 
is he not a man of honour and feeling 
hand there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm 
can he be deceitful 
a i he not i believe not cried eleanor 
a i love willing ye sincerely love him 
and on crown of hit integrity can not be more painful to yourself than to me 
it has been involuntary and i will not encourage it 
i wan startled i confess by the alteration in his manner this morning 
he did not speak like himself and did sense and snitsrsan-v. 31 not return your kindness and with cordiality 
but all this may be explained by such a situation a his affairs as you have supposed 
he had just parted from my him had seen her leave him in the greatest affection 
and if he felt obliged from a fear of offending mrs smith to resist the temptation of returning here soon and yet aware that by declining your invitation by saying that he was going away for some time he should seem to act an generous a suspicious part by our family he might well be embarrassed and disturbed 
in arch a case a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour i think as well as more consistent with his general character z 
it i will not raise objections against any one conduct on so illiberal in foundation up a difference in judgment from myself or a deviation from what i may think right and consistent 
a you m very no i 
willoughb certainly does not one boy siifpeyeted 
though we m not known him long 
he is no stranger in this part of the world 
and who has ever key to his disadvantage 
had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once but this is not the case 
it is an engagement in some respects not prosperous begun for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance 
and even secrecy as far as it can be observed may now be very advisable 
they were interrupt by the entrance of margaret 
and editor was then at lip to think over the presentation of her mother to acknowledge e the probability of many and hope for the justice of 
they saw nothing of prince till dinner time when she entered the room and took her place at the table without saying a word 
her eyes were red and swelled 
i. i 8 sense and srmsmu'rv 
and it seemed a if her dearer even then restrained with difficulty 
she avoided the looks of them all could neither eat nor speak and after came time on her mother silently pressing her hand with tender companion her small degree of fortitude was quit overcome 
the burst into tears and left the room this violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening 
she wan without any power became the was without any desire of command over herself 
the slightest mention of anything relative to willoughby overpowered her in an instant 
and though her family were coat anxiously attentive to her comfort it up impose table for them if they keep at all to keep clear of every subject which her feelings connected with him 
calm 1791 variance would have thought here we inexcusable had she been able to sleep at i the first night after parting from willoughby 
she would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning had she not rise from her bed in more need of repose than when the lay down in it 
but the feelings which made such complain a disgrace 
left her in no danger of nursing it 
she wan awoke the whole night and the wept the greatest part of it 
she or up with a headache wan unable to talk and until in to take any punishment 
giving pain e moment to her mother and sisters and forbidding attempt at consolation from either 
her sensibility woe potent enough 
when breakfast was over she walked out by herself and wandered about the village of allen indulging the recollection of part enjoyment and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning 
july sense and ansmu-rv 
31 the evening of in the usual indulge cup of feeling 
slave favourite mggtel‘iatehe had been to play to illoughhy every air in which their voice had been often joined and at 2 the imminent gazing on every line of music that he had written out for her till her heart wan i have that no farther hadnot could be gained 
and thin nouriuhment of grief was every day applied 
she spent whole hour at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying her voice often totally suspended by her tears 
in books too as well at in mimic the courted the which a contract between the put and present was certain of giving 
she read nothing but what they had been used to read together 
such violence of action indeed could not be supposed for ever 
it sunk within a few day into a calmer melancholy 
but these employments to which the daily resumed her solitary wall and silent meditations i produced occasional effusion of sorrow a lively an ever 
no letter from willoughby came and none deemed ox fed by marriage

why do you not ask variance at once a aid she a whether the in or in not engaged to willonghbyl from you her mother and to kind to indulgent a mother the question could not give offence 
it would be the natural result of your affection for her 
she need to be all reserve and to you more especially 
i would not ask inch 3 question for the world 
supposing it be that they are not engaged what distress would not such an inquiry inflict at any rate it would be most generous 
i should never deceived her confidence again after forcing from her a confession of what in mean at present to be unacknowledged to any one 
i know marianne’e heart i know that she dearly love me and that i shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known when circummncea make the resentment of it eligible 
i would not attempt to force the confidence of any one of a child much lieu became a fence of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct eleanor thought thin generosity overstrained considering her sister youth and urged the matter farther but in vain

but it gave eleanor pleasure as it produced a tray from marriage so expressive of confidence in w ought and knowledge of his intentions 
one morning about a week after his leaving the country marriage was prevailed on to join her sister in their usual walk instead of wandering away by herself 
hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in her rambles 
if her sisters intended to walk on the down she directly stole away towards the lanes if they talked of the valley the was as speedy in coming e hills 
and could never be found when the others set off 
but at length she was secured by the exertions of editor who great disapproved touch continual seclusion 
they walked along the road through the valley and cried in silence for marines mind could not be continued and finer satisfied with gaining one point would not then attempt more 
beyond the entrance of the valley where the country though still rich was less wild and more even a long stretch of the end which they had travel on first coming to bestow lay before them 
and on reaching that point they stopped to look around them and examine a prospect which formed the distance of their view from the cottage from a mat which they had never happened to reach in any of their walks before 
amongst the objects in the scene they soon discovered in arm one 
it was a man on horseback riding towards them 
in a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman 
and in a moment afterwards variance rapturously exclaimed it is he 
it is indeed

edward returned to them with each admiration of the surrounding country 
in hit walk to the village he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage 
and the village itself in a much higher situation than the cottage afforded a general view of the whole which had exceedingly pleased him 
thin was a subject which induced mananne'l attention and she wan beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes and to mention him more minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him when edward interrupted her laying

not inquire too far variance

but why should you boast of it 
a i inspect a said plainer than to avoid one kind of nﬂ'cctntion edward here fully into another 
because believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel and it disgusted with such pretensions he effects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than she he ll fastidious and will have an aﬁ'ectau'on of his own 
a it is very true laid variance 2 that admiration of landscape energy it become a mere urgent 
everybody pretend to feel and tried to desire with the fate and e elegance of him who lit defined what picturesque beauty was 
i detect art a of every kind and sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself because i could and no language to describe them in but what we worn and hackneyed out of all same and leaning 1 i am convinced said edward 2 that you really feel all the delight in a one prospect which on prefer to feel 
but in return your infer must allow me to feel no more than i profess 
i like a one prospect but not on picturesque principles 
i do not like cocked twisted blasted trees 
i admire them much more if they are tall might and flourishing 
i don't like ruined flattered cottages 
i am not fond of nettles or titles or heath blossoms 
i have more pleasure in a snug farm-house than a watchtower

variance looked with amazement at edward with compassion at her anger 
linger only laughed 
sense and sensibility 
go the subject was continued no farther 
and marriage remained thoughtfully silent all a new object suddenly engage led her attention 
she was sitting down and in taking his tea from mrs dash his hand passed so directly before her as to make a ring with a pair of hair in the centre very conspicuous on one of his fingers 
a i never saw you wear a ring before edward 1 she cried 
is that fanny's hair 
i remember her promising to give you some 
but i should have thought her hair had been darkened variance spoke inconsiderate what she really felt 
but when she saw how much she had need edward her own vexation at her want of thing r. could not be surpassed by his 
he coloured vex deeply and giving a momentary glance at eleanor reap led a as it is my sister s hair 
he setting always cast a different shade on it you know liquor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise 
that the hair was her own she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as variance 
the only difference in their conclusions was that what variance 
considered as a free gift from her sister editor was conscious must have been procured by some three or contrivance unknown to herself 
she was not in s humour however to regard it as an afloat and affecting to take no notice of what had passed by instantly talking of something else she internally resolved hence forward to catch every ofpommity of eyeing the hair and satisfying herself beyond all doubt that it was exactly the shade of her own 
towards embarrassment lasted some time and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled 
he was particularly grave the whole coming 
variance severely censured herself for what she has said 
but her own i. g 8 sense and srmsrnm-rv 
forgiveness might have been more eyes had the known how little silence it had given her sister 
before the middle of the day they were valued by sir john and man leaning who having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage came to take a curve of the gun with the acquaintance of hit mother-in-law sir john was not long in discovering that the name of terror began with an f and thin repaired a future mine of raillery again the devoted eleanor which nothing but the newness of their acquaintance with edward could have prevented from being immediately sprung 
but an it was the only learned from some very significant looks how for their creation founded on mnrgalet’l instruction extent sir john never came to the dashed without either inviting them to dine at the park the next day or to drink tea with them that evening 
on the present occasion for the better entertainment of their visitor towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute he wished to engage them for both 
you my drink tea with in to-night laid he for we shall be quite alone 
and to-morrow you a mute absolutely dine with us for we shall be a large a by pain beginnings enforced the necessity 
and who know but you may raise in dance

a who in to dance

why yourselves and the cares and whither to he sure 
what 
you thought nobody could dance because i coming person that shall be name in gone 
a i will with all my soul cried sir john that wilioughby were among us again 
sense and sensibility 
go this and marines blushing gave new to edward 
2 and who is wise ought 
a said he in a low voice to miss wood by whom he was sitting 
she gave him a brief reply 
marianne’l countenance was more communicative 
edward saw enough to comprehend not only the meaning of others but much of mariannc’s expressions as had puzzled him before 
and when their minds left them he went immediately round her and laid in a whisper i have been dressing 
shall i tell you my guess 
a hat do on mean 
a shall i tell you 
certainly a well then i guess that mr willoughby haunts 
marriage was surprised and confused yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner and after a moment s silence said john edward 
how can you up 
but the time will come i hope 
i am sure you will like him 
i do not doubt it replied he rather astonished at her earnestness and warmth 
for had he not imagined it to he s joke for the good of her acquaintance in general founded only on a something or a nothing seen mr willingly and herself he would not have ventured to mention it 
hum 5 
toward remained a week at the cottage 
he was earnestly pressed by mrs dashed to stay longer 
but as if he were bent only on self-mortiﬁcation he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height 
his loo skins and sensibility 
spirit during the in two or three days though still very unusual were greatly improved 
he grew more and more partial to the house and environs 
never spoke of going away without a till he 
declared his time to be wholly disengaged 
even united to what place he should go when he left them 
but still go he must 
never had any week passed so quickly 
he could hardly believe it to be gone 
he said so repeatedly 
other things he said too which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions 
he had no pleasure at morland 
be detected being in town 
but either to scotland or london he must go 
he valued their kindness beyond anything and his greatest happiness in being with them 
yet he must leave them at the end of a week in spite of their wishes and his own and without any restraint on his time 
liquor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his father's account 
and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known m her as to he the general excuse for everything strange on the part of her son 
drift pointed however and vexed as she was and sometimes pleased with his uncertain behaviour to herself 
she very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications which had been rather more painfully extorted from her for willoughby s service by her mother 
his want of spirits of openness and of consistency were most usually attributed to his want of independence and his better knowledge of mrs fears dispositions and designs 
the shortness of his visit the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them originated in the same flattered inclination the same inevitable necessity of temporising with his mother 
the old well-cmblished grievance of dust against will parent against child was the cause of all 
she would have been glad to know when these dilﬁculsense and sensibility 
a 26 ties were to cease this opposition was to yield 
when mrs frank would be restored and her con be at l. to be happy 
but from inch vain wished 
the was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in edward affecting to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at parson and above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his anger 
i think edward a said my dashed as they were at breakfast the last morning you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plan and actions 
some inconvenience to your friends indeed might result from it 
you would not be able to give them so much of your time 
but with a smile you would be materially bench in one particular at least 
you would know where to go when you left them i do assure you he replied that i have long thought on this point as you think now 
it has been and is and probably will always be a heavy misfortunes me that i have had no necessary business to engage me no profession to give me am enjoyment or afford me anything like independence 
but unfortunately in own nicety and the nicety of my friends have made me what i am an idle helpless being 
we never could agree in our choice of a profession 
i always preferred the church an i still do 
but that was not part enough for my family 
they recommended the army 
that was a great deal too smart for me 
the law wan allowed to be genteel enough 
many young men who had chambers in the temple made a very good appearance in the first circles and drove about town in very knowing gigs 
but i had no inclination for the law even in this less absolute study of it which my family approved 
a for the navy it had fashion on its side 2 sense and sensibility 
but i wan too old when the subject rum first named to enter it 
and at length at then wan no deceit for my having any profession at all as i might be an aching and expensive without a. red coat on my back a with one idleness wan pronounced on the whole to be the most advantageous and honourable and a young man of eighteen in not in general it eagerly bent on being buy no to resist the solicitation 
of hit friend to do nothing 
i was therefore entered at oxford and have been properly idle ever since 
the consequence of which 
suppose will be a laid on dashed since leisure ll not promoted your own happiness that your tom will be brought up to at many pursuit employments professional and trees on collumella’a 
they will be brought up a said he in a serious accent to be as unlike myself as in double 
in feeling in action in condition in every 
a me come 
thrill all an delusion of immediate want of spirits edward 
you are in a melancholy humour and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy 
but remember that the pain of parting from friend will be felt by even body at times whatever be their education or state 
now your own happiness 
you want nothing but patience 
or give it a more fascination name call it hope 
your mother will secure to you in time that independence you are no anxious for 
it in her duty and it will it fun ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent 
how much my not a few months do 
a a i think a replied edward that i may defy many month m pmrlucu any good to me 
this desponding turn of mind though it could not be communicated to mrs wood gave additional pain to them all in the parting which shortly took place sense and sensibility 
on and left an uncomfortable impression on elinor’a feelings by which required name trouble and arm to use 
but an it was her determination to subdue it and to prevent herself from a ring to fuller more than what all her family ruﬂ'erecinf his going away she did not adopt the method no judicious ye employed by marriage on a similar occasion to augment and ix her now by asking silence solitude and idleness 
their meant were as different an their objects and equally united to the advancement of each 
liquor sat down to her dining-table a. took a he was out of the home busily am loved herself the whole day neither sought nor avoid the mention of his name appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general contempt of the family and if by thin conduct she did net lessen her own grief it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase and her mother and severe were spared much solitude on her account 
such behaviour an this so exactly the reverie of her own appeared no more meritorious to marriage than her own had seemed faulty to her 
the huainmof self-command the settled very c silly 
— with strong affections it was impossible with calm once it could have no merit 
that her animal actions were calm the dared not deny though she blushed to acknowledge it 
and of the strength of her own the gave a very striking proof by still loving and respecting that sister in it of thin mortifying conviction 
without shutting herself up from her family or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them or laying awake the whole night to indulge meditation eleanor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of edward and of edward behaviour in every possible variety which the direct rate of her spirit at different time could produce 
— with tender 14 sons and sensibility 
pity approbation censure and doubt 
there were moments in abundance when if not by the absence of her mother and listen at least i the nature of their e lyme conversation was forbidden among them every effect of solitude was produced 
her mind was inevitably at liberty 
her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere 
and the past and the future on a subject so interesting must be before her must force her attention and engross her memory her reflection and her fancy 
from a reverie of this kind as she sat at her dining-table the was used one morning soon after edward s leaving them by the arrival of company 
she happened to be quite alone 
the closing of the little gate at the entrance of the green court in front of the house drew her eyes to the window and she saw a large part walking up to the door 
amongst them were sir john and lady middle and mrs beginnings 
but there were two others a gentleman and lady who were quite unknown to her 
she was sitting near the window and as soon as sir john perceived her he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door and stepping across the turf obliged her to open the casement to speak to him though the space was so short between the door and the window as to make it hardly possible to speak at one without being heard at the other 
well a said he we have brought you some strangers 
how do you like them 
a rush 
they will hear you 
a never mind if they do 
it is only the paler 
charlotte is very pretty i can tell you 
you may see her if you look this way as editor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes without taking that liberty she begged to be excused

15 1 where is marriage 
has she run away because we are come 
i see her instrument is open a she is walking i believe they were now joined by mrs beginnings who had not patience enough to wait till the door was open before she told bar story 
she came hallooing to the window a how do you do my dear 
how does mrs dashed do 
and where are your sisters 
what 
all alone 
you will be glad of a little company to sit with you 
i have brought my other son and days her those you 
all think of their coming so s only 
i thought i d a carriage last night while we were drinking our tea but it never entered my had that it could be them 
i thought of nothing but whether it might not be colonel grandson come back again 
so i aid to sir john i do think i hear a carries a 
perhaps it is colonel grandson come back a sun 8 editor was obliged to turn from her in the middle of her story to receive the rest of the party 
lady middle introduced the two strangers 
mrs wood and margaret came downstairs at the same time and they all sat down to look at one another while my bearings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour attended by sir john 
mrs paper was several years younger than lady middle and totally unlike her in every respect 
she was short and plump had a very pretty face and the honest expression of good humour in it that could possibly be 
her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister s but they were much more prepossessing 
she came in with 1 smile 
smiled all the time of her visit except when she laughed and smiled when she went away 
her husband was a grave looking young man of vice or six and twenty with an air of more on and sense than his wife but of less willingness to please i of sense and sensibility 
or to be placed 
he entered the room with a look of self 
consequence slightly bowed to the ladies without making a word and after briefly surveying them and i apartments took up a newspaper from the table and continued to read it as long as he rid 
mrs paler on the contrary who was strongly endowed by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour and everything in it burst forth 
a well 
what a delightful room this is 
i never w anything so charming 
only think mamma how it is improved since i was here last 
i also i thought it such a sweet place ma'am turning to us dashed but you have made it so charming 
only look sister how delightful everything is 
how should like such a house for myself 
should not you mr paler 
a mr paler made her no answer and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper 
a mr paler does not hear me said she laughing 
a he never does sometimes 
it is so ridiculous 
a this was quite a new idea to mrs dashed 
she had never been used to and wit in the inattention of any one and could not help looking with surprise at them both 
mrs joining in the meantime talked on as loud as she could and continued her account of their surprise the evening before on seeing their friends without ceasing till everything was told 
mrs paler laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment and everybody agreed two or three times over that it had been quite an agreeable surprise 
a you may believe how glad we all were to see them a added mrs beginnings leaning forward towards editor and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard b no one else though they were seated on different of a m t but however i can sense and sensibility 
10 help wishing they had not travelled quite so full nor made such a long journey of it for they came all round by london upon account of some lies for you know nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter it was wrong in her situation 
i wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning but she would come with us 
she longed so much to see you all 
a mrs paler laughed and said it would not do her any harm 
a she expects to be confined in february continued mrs beginnings 
lady middle could no longer endure such a conversation and therefore exerted himself to ask mr calmer if there was any news in the paper 
a no none at all a he replied and read on 
a here comes arrange a cried sir john 
a now paler you shall see a monstrous pretty girl he immediately went into the passage opened the front door and ushered her in himself 
my bearings asked her as soon as she a are if she had not been to allen 
and mrs aylmers laughed so heavily at the question as to show she understood it 
mr paler looked up on her entering the room stared at 
her some minutes and then returned to hit newspaper 
my pales eye was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room 
she got up to examine them 
oh 
dear how beautiful these are 
well how delightful 
do but look common how sweet 
i declare they are quite charming 
i could look at them for ever and then sitting down again she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room 
when lady middle rose to go away mr paler rooke also laid down the newspaper stretched himself and looked at them all round 
3 sense sun sensibility 
all my love have you been asleep 
a said his wife lauﬁllnng 
e made her no answer and only observed after again examining the room that it was very low-pitched and that the ceiling was cocked 
he then made his bow and departed with the rest 
sir john had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at the park 
mrs daishwood who did not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined at the cottage absolutely refused on her own account 
her daughters might do as they pleased 
but they had no curiosity to see how mr and mrs paler ate their dinner and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way 
they attempt tried therefore likewise to excuse themselves 
the west ear was uncertain and not likely to be good 
but sir john would not be satisfied 
— the carriage should be sent for them and they must come 
lady middle too though she did not press their mother pressed them 
mrs leaning and mrs paler joined their entreaties all seemed rally anxious to avoid a family party and the younge‘ladies were obliged to yield 
a why should they ask us i said variance as soon as they were gone 
2 the rent of this cottage is said to he now 
but we have it on very hard terms if we are dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them or with us 
a they mean no less to be civil and kind to us now a said eleanor 1 by these frequent invitations than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago 
the alteration is not in them if their parties are grown tedious and dull 
we must look for the change elsewhere

ah

there is not much difference 
i never was at his house 
but they lay it in a sweet pretty place 
a a vile a post a ever i saw in my life a said mr paler

a then it must be some other place that is to pretty i sup one hen they were seated in the dining-room sir john observed with regret that they were only eight all together

i was impossible for any one to be more thoroughly good-natured or more determined to be happy than mr paler 
the studied indifference insolence ill discontent of her husband gave her no pain 
and when he scolded or abused her the was highly diverted 
a 5 partner in no droll i a said the in a whisper to minor 
a he is always out of humour 
editor was not inclined after a little observation to give him credit for being so genial and unafl'ecudly ill-natured or ill-bred as he wish to up or 
his temper might perhaps be a little secured by riding like many other of being box that through some unaccountable him in favour of beauty he wan the husband of a very silly woman

it was rather a witch of distinction

he believed which used hieonrunpunn treatment of everybody all-lid» general hue of everything before him 
it war the denial of appearing superior to otherpeople

oh he never owned his affection to yourself 
a job 
no 
but if woman had not objected it i dare nay he would have liked it of all thing

mr paler is just the kind of man i like sense and sensibility 
i in chapter 5 
he aylmers returned to livedand the next day and the two families at baron were again left to entertain each other 
but this did not lame long 
liquor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head 
had hardly done wondering at charlotte being so happy without a cause at mr aylmers acting so simply with good abilities and at the strange suitableness which often existed between husband and wife before sir john and mrs jennings’ active zeal in the cause of society procured her some other new acquaint once to see and observe 
in a moving excursion to exeter they had met with two young ladies whom mrs beginnings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her relations and this was enough for sir john to invite them directly to the park as soon as their present en events at exeter were over 
their engagements at exeter instantly gave way before such an invitation and lady middle was thrown into no little alarm on the return of sir john by hearing that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life and of whose elegance 
whose tolerable gentility even she could have no proof 
for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for nothing at all 
they being her relations too trade it so much the worse 
and mrs jennings’ attempt at consolation were therefore unfortunate founded when she advised her daughter not to care about their being so fashionable because they were all cousins and must put up with one another 
as it was if he however now to prevent their coming lady middle resigned herself to the idea of it with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman could 18 sense and sensibility 
treating shelf with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject live or six times every day 
the young ladies arrived their appearance wan by no meanungenteel or fashionable 
their dress was very smart their manners very civil they were delighted with the home and in rapture with the where and they happened to be no doatingly fond of children that lady mlddlcton’l good opinion wan engaged in their favour before they had been an hour at the park 
she declared them to be very agreeable girl 
indeed which for her ladyship was enthusiast admiration 
sir john’conﬁdence in hit own judgment hole with thin animated line and he net of directly for the cottage to tell the its dashwooda of the main select arrival and to nature them of their being the sweetest girl in the world 
from such commendation as this however there wan not much to be learned 
liquor well know that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met with in every part of england under every possible variation of from face temper and understanding 
sir john wanted the whole family to walk to the park directly and look at his aunt 
benevolent philanthropic man 
it was awful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself 
a do come now a said he 
pray come 
must come 
i declare you shall come you can in how you will like them 
lucy it monument pretty and so good-humoured and agreeable 
the children are all hanging about her already an if the wan an old acquaint once 
and they both long to see you of all things for they have heard at exeter that you are the most beautiful crcnturcl in the world 
and i have told them it it all very true and a great deal more 
you will be delighted with them i am cure 
they luck brought the whole coach full of playing for the children 
how can you be to cross at not to come 
why they sense and sensibility 
by are your mail you know after ten fashion 
to a cousins they are m wit s so must no m yes yes but sir john could not prevail 
he could only obtain i promise of their calling at the park within a day or two and then left them in amazement at their indifference to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the miss success as he had been already boasts of the miss stables to them 
when their promised visit to the park and consequent introduction to these young ladies took place by found in the appearance of the eldest who was nearly thirty with a very plain and not a sensible face nothing to admire 
but in the other who was not more than two or three and twenty they acknowledged considerable beauty 
her features were pretty and she had a sharp quick eye and s partner of air which though it did not give actual elegance or grace gave distinction to her person 
their manners were particularly civil and finer soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense when she saw with what constant and judicious attentions they were making themselves agreeable to lady middle 
with her children they were in continual raptures exulting their beauty courting their notice and murmuring all their whims 
and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demand which this politeness made on it was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing if she happened to be doing anything or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight 
fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles a and mother though in pursuit of noise for her children the most precious of human 
age is likewise the most incredulous 
her demands are exorbitant 
but she will swallow anything 
and the 20 sense and sensibility 
excessive affection and endurance of the main steeper towards her offspring were viewed therefore by lady middling without the smallest cup ride or divert 
she saw with maternal complacency all the imminent ineronehmenn and mischievous tricks to which her cousin submitted 
she saw their sashes unfixed their hair pulled about their can their work-bagsearched and their knives and actually stolen away and felt no doubt of in being a reciprocal enjoyment 
it suggested no other surprise than that editor and marriage should sit in completely by without claiming a there in what wan gang

each a reward for her then the child was too wise to cease crying 
she still screamed and rubbed luckily kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her end all their united within were ineffectual till lady middle luckily renew ring that in a scene of iirnilnr distress m week some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a raised temple the same remedy wan eagerly proposed for this unfortunate match and a slight intermission of scream in the young lady on hearing it gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected 
she was carried out of the room therefore in her mother arms in quest of this medicine and as the two boys chose to follow though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind the four young indeed were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours 
poor little creature 
a said mine stole a noon as they were gone 
a it might have been a very and accident yet i hardly know how cried variance

by what a sweet woman lady middle is laid luck steal 
prince was silent 
it was impossible for her to say what she did not feel however trivial the occasion 
and upon eleanor 
therefore the whole task of telling lie when politeness required it always fell 
she did her best when thus called on by speaking of lady middle with more warmth than she felt though with far less than miss lucy

perhaps they may be the outside of enough 
but it i 
no natural in lad middle 
and for my part i love to lee chill rein full of life and u‘pll'lll 
i can not hear them if they are tame and quite a i confess 
replied plainer than while i am at baron park i never think of tame and quiet children with any nbhorrcnce.” a short acute succeeded thin speech which at lit broken by in steal who seemed very much do for conversation and who now said rather abrupt and how do you like devonohire mien drew up i suppose you were very sorry to leave sunex.” in some surprise at the familiarity of thin question 
or at least at the manner in which it war polite eleanor replied that the war

a i think every one arm admire it a lie eleanor 1 who ever raw the place 
though it is not to be suppose that any one can estimate it beauties an we do and had you i great many smart beaux there 
i moor you have not to many in this part of the sense and sensible xlv 
i 23 world 
for my part i think they are a vast addition 1 5 
at why should you think a said lucy looking ashamed of her sister that there are not as many genteel young men in derbyshire as guesses 2 1 nay ran dear m sure i do n't pretend to say that there and 
am sure here's a met many smart been in exeter 
but you know how could i tell what smart beaux there might be about morland 
and i was only afraid the miss dashwoods might and it dull at parson if they had not so many as they used to have 
but perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux and had belief be without them as with them 
for my part i think they are vastly a feeble provided they dress smart and behave civil 
t i can hear to see them dirty and nasty 
now there s mr rose at exeter a prodigious shut young man nice a band clerk to mr simpleton you know and yet i you do but method of morning he is not lit to be seen 
i sup see your brother was quite a beau miss dashed force he married as he was so rich in upon my word replied eleanor i can not tell you for i do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word 
but this i can say that if he ever was as been before he fancied he is one kill for there is not the smallest alteration in him for

anne 1 cried her sister 1 you can talk of nothing but beaux 
— you m ll make miss dashed believe you think of nothing else and then to turn the discourse she began admiring the house and furniture 
this specimen of the miss stables was enough 
the vulgar freedom and fall of the eldest left her no recommendation and as blind was not blinded by the 14th sense and sensiihjtvv beauty or the thread look of the youngest to her want of mr elegance and anlettnett the left the home without any with of knowing them better

they mine from exeter well provided with admiration for the use of sir john mild eton hit family and all hit relation and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to hit fair confine whom they declared to be the most bmutiﬁll elegant accomplished and agreeable first they had ever beheld and with whom they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted 
and to better a minute therefore eleanor soon found wan their never let lot 
for to sir john will entirely on the tide of the mist smile their puny would be too many for position and that kind of intimacy must be submitted to which consists of sitting an hour or two together in the tame room not every day 
sir john could do no more 
but he did not know that any more was required 
to be together was in hit opinion to intimate and while hit continual scheme for their meeting were effectual he had not a doubt of their being established friends 
to do him justice he did every thing in hit war to promote their unreserve by me in the mist talent acquainted with whatever he knew or to of his cousin situations in the man delicate payment 
and liquor had not seen them more than twice before the eldest of them wished her joy on her bitter having been so lucky an to make a conquest of i very man beau since the came to pardon 
will be a one thing have her married young to be sure a aid the hand i hear he it quite a beau and prodigious handsome 
and i hope you may have at good luck yourself too 
but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already eleanor could not suppose that sir john would be more nice in proclaim hit opinion of her regard for sense and sensibility 
15 edward than he had been with respect to balance 
indeed it was rather his favourite jot e of the two as being somewhat never and more con turf and since edward visit they had never dinedletogether without his drinking to her best affections with so much signiﬁeancy and so man nods and works as to excite general attention 
tie letter f 
had been likewise invariably brought forward and found productive of such countless jokes that its character as the bitterest letter in the alphabet had been long established with eleanor the miss stables as she expected had now all the benefit of these jokes and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman alluded to which though often impertinently expressed was perfectly of a piece with her general inquiutiveness into the concerns their family 
but sir john did not it long with the curiosity which he dealt hated to raise or he had at least as much pleasure in tell in the name as miss steal had in hearing it 
his name is terror 1 aid he in a very audible whisper 
but pray do not tell it for it a great room a formal 
repeated miss steal 
mr forms is the happy man is he 
what 
your sister-imlsw’s brother 1st dashwoodi a very agreeable young man to be sure 
i know him very well 
a a how can you say so anne 
a cried lucy who generally made an amendment to all her sisters alterations 
though we have seen him once or twice at my unless it is rather too much in pretend know him v well 
liquor had all this with attention and surprise 
and who was this uncle 
where did he live 
how came they acquainted 
she wished very much to have the subject continued though she did not chose 16 sense and sensibility 
to bring in it herself 
but nothing more of it was said an for the first time in her life she thought mrs beginnings deficient either in curiosity after petty information or in a dish motion to communicate it 
the manner in which in steal had spoken of edward increased her curiosity 
for it struck her as being rather ill-natured and suggested the suspicion of that lady knowing or fancy no herself to know something to his disadvantage 
at her curiosity wan unavailing for no farther notice was taken of mr ferrari’s name by miss steal when alluded to or even openly mentioned by sir john 
calm all advance who had never much toleration for in like impertinence vulgar interior of parts or even difference of taste am here was at this time particularly ill-disposed 
from the state of her spirits to be pleased with the miss stables or to a encourage their advances 
and to the invariable coldness of her behaviour towards them which checked ever endeavour at intimacy on their side eleanor principally attributed that preference of herself which soon became evident in the manners of both but especially of lucy who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank communication of her sentiments 
lucy was naturally clever 
her remarks were often just and muslin 
and as a companion for half an hour eleanor frequent d found her agreeable 
but her powers had received no aid from education she was ignorant and illiterate and her deficiency of all mental improvement her want of information in the most common sense and sensible laity 
i 17 particular could not be concealed from mine wood in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to advantage 
liquor us and pitied her for the neglect of abilities which education might have rendered no cradle 
but she saw with less tenderer of feeling the thorough want of delicacy of rectitude and integrity of mind which her attention 
her assiduities her flatteries at the park betrayed 
and due could have no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance whose want of inaction prevented their meeting in conversation on terms of equal italy and whom conduct towards other made every now of attention and deference toward herself perfectly valueless 
a you will think my question an odd one i dare lay laid lucy in her one day as they were walking together from the park to the cottage 
a but play are you personally acquainted with your litter-in-law’l mother my fear i a minor end think the question a very odd one and her countenance expressed it an the answered that 
she had never seen mr f error 
“indccdl” replied lucy 
i wonder at that for i thought you must have seen her at morland sometimes 
then perhaps you can not tell me what on of a woman she is 
a not a returned eleanor caution of giving her real opinion of edward mother and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity 
a i know nothing of her i am sure you think me very strange for inquiring about her in such a way a said lucy eyeing eleanor attentively as she spoke 
but perhaps there may be reason 
i wish i might venture 
but however i hope you will do me the justice of believing that i do not mean to be impertinent 28 sense and sensibility 
liquor made her a civil reply and they walked on for a few minutes in silence 
it was broken by lucy who renewed the subject again by saying with some hesitation 
a i can not hear to have-you think me impertinently curious 
i am sure i would rather do anything in the world than be thought so by a person whose and opinion is so well worth having as ours 
and am sure i should not have the natural east far of turning you indeed i should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such an income noble situation as i am 
but however there is no occasion to trouble you 
i am sorry you do not happen to know mrs terrors 
a i am sorry i do not a said liquor in great astonishment of it could be of any use to m to know my opinion of her 
but really i never understood that on were at all connected with that angrily and therefore i an a little surprised i confess at so serious an inquiry into her character i dare say you are and i am sure i do not at all wonder artist 
at if i dared tell you all you would not be so much surprised 
mrs fears is certainly nothing to me at present 
but the time to come 
how soon it will come must depend upon herself 
when we may be very intimately connected 
she looked down as she said this amiable bashful with only one side-glance at her companion to observe its effect on her 
a good heavens 
cried eleanor a what do mean 
are you acquainted with mr robert fears 
can you be in and she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law 
a no replied lucy not to mr robert farm 
— i never saw him in my life 
but bring her eyes upon eleanor 1 to his elder brother what felt linger at that moment 
astonished 
sense and sensibility 
29 that would have been as full as it was strong had not an immediate dislike of the assertion attended it 
she turned towards lucy in silent amazement unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration 
and though her complexion varied she stood firm in credulity and felt in no danger of an hysterical it or a spoon 
you may well be surprised a continued lucy 
a for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before 
for i dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family 
because it was always meant to be a great secret and i am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour 
not a soul of all my relations know of it but anne and i never should have mentioned it to you if i had not felt the greatest de dance in the world upon your senses 
and i maliyelhou hit my behaviour in asking so many questions about with terriers must seem so odd that it ought to be explained 
and i do not think mr f error can be displeased when he knows i have trusted you because i know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family and looks upon yourself and the other miss dashwoods quite as his own scanty 
she used 
paling for a few moments remained silent 
her astonishment at what she heard was at rest too great for words 
but at length forcing herself to speak and to speak cautiously she said with a calmness of manner which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude 
a may i ask if your engagement is of long standing 
a 
we have been engaged these four years 
a four years 
a a cup eleanor though greatly shocked still felt unable to believe it 
i. i 30 sense and sensldllﬂ'y 
i did not know lid she that you were ever acquainted till the other day 
a our acquaintance however it of many years date 
he war under my uncle care you know a confidence while a your uncle 
a a yes 
mr pratt 
did you never hear him talk of mr pratt 
i think i have a lie eleanor with an exertion of spirit which here with her increase of emotion 
he was four year with my uncle who lives at longataple near plymouth 
it was there our acquaintance begun for m timbers and me was often staying with my uncle an it was there our engagement wan formed though not till a year after he had quitted ii a pupil 
but he was almost always with or afterward 
was vile unwilling to enter into it at you may imagine without the knowledge and approbation of his mother 
but i win too young and loved him too well to be no prudent at i ought to have hem 
though you do not know him to well a. me mine wood you men have seen enough of him to be terribly he ll very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him 
certainly a answered eleanor without knowing what the rapid 
but after a moment rejection she added with revived security of edwil‘d’l honour and love and her companion falsehood 
-5 engaged to mr edward fear i 
i confer myself to totally surprised at what you tell me that really 
i beg our pardon 
but purer there must be some mistake of person or name 
we can not mean the name mr fen-nu.” we can mean no other a cried luck uniting 
mr edward february the eldest none of me fear of park-street and brother of your sister-in-law men john daehwood is the person i mean 
you must allow sense 
and sensibility 
13 
thatlunnotlikel when deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends it is strange replied liquor in a most painful perplexity that i should never have heard him even mention your name 
a no 
considering our situation it was not strange 
our first care has been to keep the matter secret 
— you knew nothing of me or my family and therefore there could he no german for ever mention my name to you 
and as he was all particularly rid of his 
sister's suspecting anything but was reason enough for his not mentioning it she was silent 
— eleanor s security sunk 
but her self-command did not sink with it 
a four years you have been engaged a said she with a warm voice 
a yes 
and heaven know how much longer we may have to wait 
poor edward 
it puts him write out of hearts then taking a small miniature from her pocket the added to prevent the possibility of mistake he so good as to look at this face 
it does not do him justice to he mildly but yet i think you can not be deceived as to the person it was drew for 
i have had it above these three years she put it into her hands as she spoke and when eleanor saw the aiming whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision or her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind she could have none of its being edward s face 
she returned it almost instantly acknowledging the likeness 
i have never been able 1 continued lucy to give him my picture in return which i am very much vexed at for he has been always so anxious to get it but i am determined to sit for it the very next portunity.” 1 on are quite in the right 1 replied eleanor calmly 
2 sense and shisibiuty 
they then proceeded a few pace in silence 
lucy spoke first 
a 
i am sure a said the i have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping thin secret became you must know of what importance it ll to us not to have it reach kill mother 
for she would never a veil of it i dare say 
i shall have no fortune 
and i fancy she is an exceeding proud woman i certainly did not seek your commence a aid eleanor 
a but you do me no more than justice in imagining that i may be depended on 
your seem in safe with me 
but pardon me if i explore some surprise at so unnecessary a communication 
you must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to in safety 
as the said this she looked earnestly at lucy hoping to discover something in her countenance 
perhaps the falsehood of the greater part of what she had been saying 
but lucy s countenance suffered no change 
a i was afraid you would think i wan taking a great liberty with you aid she in telling you all thin 
i have not known you long to be sure finally at lent but i have known you and all your mine by drop 
tom a great while 
and as won as i saw or i felt almost an if you wan an old acquaintance 
guide 
in the present case i really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about edward mother 
and i am so unfortunate that i have not a creature whose advice i can ask 
anne in the only person that know of it and she he no judgment at all 
indeed she does me a great deal more hannah good for i am in constant fear of her betraying me 
she does not know how to hold her tongue at you must perceive 
and i am here i was in the greatest fright in the world t other day when edward name was mentioned by sir john lest she should out with it all 
you sure nun sensibility 
31 can think how much i go through in my mind from it altogether 
i only wonder that i am alive after what i have suffered g edward sake these last four years 
everything in such suspense and uncertainty and seeing him so seldom 
we can hardly meet above twice vicar 
i am sure i wonder my heart is not quite broke 
here she took out her handkerchief 
but liquor did not feel very compassionate 
a sometimes a continued lucy after wiping her eyes a i think whether it would not better for us both to break of 
the matter entirely as she said this she looked directly at her companion 
but then at other times i have not resolution enough for it 
i can not bear the thoughts of making him so miserable as i know the very mention of such a thing would do 
and on my own account too 
so dear as he is to me 
i don't think i could be equal to it 
what would gain advise me to do in such a case miss dashed 
but would you do yourself 
a a pardon me help led eleanor startled by the question 
a but i can give you no advice under such circumstances 
your own judgment must direct you 
a to be sure continued lucy after a cow minutes silence on both sides 1 his mother must provide for him some time or other 
but poor edward it so cast down about it 
did not you think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at baron 
he was so miserable when he left us at constable to go to you that i was afraid you would think him quite ill 
did he come from your uncle then when he visited us 2 a a oh yes 
he had been staying a fortnight with us 
did you think he came directly from town e into a relied eleanor most feeling sensible of every fresh circumstance in favour of luck veracity 
4 sense and sensibility 
i remember he told us that he had been staying a fortnight with some friend near plymouth she remembered too her own surprise at the time at his mentioning nothing further of these friends 
at his total silence with respect even to their names 
did not you think him sadly out of spirits 
repeated lucy 
we did indeed particularly so when he lit arrived 
a i begged him to exert himself for fear you should an t what were the matter 
but it made him no me angrily not being able to may more than a fourth night with us and seeing me to much affected 
poor fellow 
— i am afraid it is just the some with him now 
for he writes in wretched a brief 
i heard from him just before i the extreme 
taking letter from her pocket and calmly showing the direction to minor 
a you know his hand i dare say a charming one it in 
but that in not written so well as usual 
he was tired i dare say for he had just called the sheet to me as full as possible 
liquor saw that it war his hand and oh could doubt no longer 
the picture the had allowed herself to believe might have been accidentally obtained 
it might not have been edward s gift 
but a correspondence between them by letter could subsist only under a positive engagement could be authorised by nothing else 
for a few moments the was almost overcome 
her heart sunk within her and she could hardly stand 
but exertion was indispensably necessary and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings that her success was speedy and for the lime complete 
waiting to each other a said lucy returning the letter into her pocket 2 is the only comfort we have in such long separations 
yes i have one other common sense and szrrsmnnv 
3 in his lecture 
but poor edward has not even low 
if he heath in picture he says he should be easy 
i gave him s cup of my hair set in a ring when he was at long-mph last and that was some comfort to him he said but not equal to a picture 
perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him 
a i did a said eleanor with a cow he of voice under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond anything she had ever felt before 
she was married shocked confounded 
fortunately for her they had now reached the cottage and the conversation could be continued no further 
after sitting with them a few minutes the miss steal 
returned to the park and editor was then at liberty to think and be wretched 
chin a 
however small elinor’l general dependence on lucy veracity might be it was impossible for her on serious reflections to aspect it in the present case where no tent tom could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a what lucy had asserted to be true therefore eleanor could not dared not longer doubt 
supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes 
their opportunity of an instance in the house of mr pratt was a foundation or the rest at 
once indisputable and alarming 
and towards vivant near plymouth his melancholy state of mind his dissatisfaction at his own respects his uncertain behaviour towards herself the intimate knowledge of the main steal as to scotland and their family connexion which had often surmised 5 16 sense and sensrnrun’ 
her the picture the letter the ring 
formed altogether such a body of evidence at overcame every fear condemning him unfairly and blinded up a fact which no partiality could net side his ill-treatment of herself 
her resentment of inch behaviour her at having been its dupe for a short time made her feel only for herself 
but other ideas other consideration noon arose 
had edward been intentionally deceiving her 
had he signed a regard for her which he did not feel 
what his engagement to lucy an engagement of the heart 
no 
whatever it might one have been the could not believe it such at present 
his affection was all her own 
she could not be deceived in that 
her mother lines fanny all had been conscious of his 
regard for her at morland 
it war not an intrusion of her own vanity 
he certainly loved her 
what it softened of the heart was thin permission 
how much could it not tempt her to forgive 
he had been blameable hid by blameable in remaining at morland after he first eat her influence over him to be more than it ought to be 
in that he could not lat-defended 
but if he had injured her how much more had he injured himself 
if her case were pitiable his war hopeless 
his imprudence had made her miserable for while 
but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever been otherwise 
she might in time regain tranquillity 
out in what had he to look forward to 
could he ever be tolerably ha play with lucy steal 
could he were his affection for herself out of the question with his integrity his delicate and well-informed mind be satisfied with a wife like her 
illiterate arthur and selfish 
the youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to everything but her beauty and good nature 
but the four succeeding years 
years which if rationally spent give such improvement to the understand a 
and sensibility 
3 standing must have opened his eyes to her defects of education while the me period of time spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty 
if in the en position of his seeking to marry herself his difficulties from his mother had seemed great how much greater were they now likely to be when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connexions and probably inferior in fortune to herself 
these difficulties indeed with a heart so alienated from lucy might not rest very hard upon his patience 
but melancholy was e state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness could be felt as a relief i as these considerations occurred to her in painful succession she wept for him more than for herself 
supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present anna dimness and consoled by the belief that edward ha done nothing to forfeit her esteem she thought she could even now under the first smart of the heavy blow command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the cloth from her mother and sisters 
and so well was she able s answer her own expectations that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes no one would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters that editor was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love and that marriage was internally dwelling on the perfections of a man of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house 
the necessity of concealing from her mother and marriage what had been entrusted in confidence to her 18 sermon nun snusnnm-rv 
self though it in her to unceasing exertion 
was no aggravation of eleanor's distress 
on the contrary it was a relief to her so be spared the communication of what would give such alllicﬁon to them and to he saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of edward which would probably now from the excess of their partial affection for herself and which was more than she felt equal to support 
from their counsel or their conversation she knew she could receive no assistance 
their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress while her self-command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise 
she was stronger alone and her own good sense so well supported her that her harness was as unshaken her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable as with regrets so poignant and so fresh it was possible for them to be 
much as she had suffered from her first conversation with lucy on the subject she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it and this for more rooms than one 
she wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement are hated again she wanted more clearly to understand xli 
lucy really felt for edward whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him and she particularly wanted to convince lucy by her readiness to enter on the matter again and her calmness in converting on it that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend which she very much feared her involuntary addition in their morning discourse men have left at least doubtful 
that lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable 
it was plain that edward had always s spoken highly in her praise not merely from lucy s ambition but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance with a secret so confessedly a evidently important 
and even sir john joking intelligence must sense and sensibility 
if have had some weight 
but indeed while eleanor remained so well augured within herself of being really beloved by edward it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that lucy should be joy our 
and that she was so her very confidence was u‘gmof 
what other reason for the disclosure of the a i could there be but that eleanor i hit be informed by it of such as superior claims on reward and be night to avoid him in future 
she had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rivals intention and while she was warmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed to combat her own attention for edward and to see him as little as possible 
she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince luck that her heart was announced 
and as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already been told she did not mistrust her own nobility of going through a repetition of particulars with composure 
but it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could he commanded though lucy was as well disguised as herself to take advantage of any that occurred 
for the weather was not often one enough to allow of their joining in a walk where they might most easily separate themselves from the other 
and though they met at least every other evening either at the park or come e and cried at the former they could not be up to meet for the sake of conversation 
such a thought would never enter either sir john or lady milton s head and therefore very little leisure was ever given for general chat and none at all for particular discourse 
they met for the sake of eating drinking and laughing together playing at cards or consequences or any other game that was sufficiently noisy 
one or two meetings of this kind had taken place 4 sense and sensibility 
without according eleanor any chance of engaging lucy in private when sir john called at the cottage one morning to beg in the name of charity that they would all dine with lady middle that day as he was obliged to attend the club at exeter and the would otherwise be quite alone except her mother and the two mist steeper 
editor who force a fairer opening for the point she had in view in such a party as thin was likely to be more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well-bred direction of lady middle than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose immediately accepted the invitation 
margaret with her mother permission we equally complaints and marriage though always unwilling to join any of their parties was subdued by her mother who could not bear to have her secluded herself from any chance of amusement to go likewise 
the young ladies went and lady middle wan happily preserved from the fruit hateful solitude which had threatened her 
the inside city of the meeting wan exactly such as liquor had expected 
it produced not one novelty of thought or expression and nothing could he lets interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing-room to the latter the children accompanied them and while they remained there she was too well convinced of the impossibility of en arguing lucy attention to attempt it 
they quitted it on my with the removal of the tea-things 
the constable was then placed and editor began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of finding time for conversation at the park 
they all rose up in preparation for a round game 
a i am glad said lady middle to lucy you are not going to wish poor little annamaria’a basket this evening 
for i am sure it must hurt your eye 
to work disagree by candlelight 
and we will make the sense and shsibiuty 
is dear little love some amends for her disappointment tomorrow and then i hope she will not much mind it 
thin hint wan enough 
lucy recollected himself instantly and replied a indeed you are very much mistaken lady middle 
i am only waiting to know whether you can make our party without me or i should have been at my disagree already 
i would not disappoint the little angel for all the world 
and if you want me at the card-table now 1 am resolved to finish the basket after sup ere you are very good 
hope it went hurt your eyes 
will you ring the bell for some working candles 
my poor little girl would be sadly disappointed i know if the basket was not finished to-morrow for though i told her it certainly would not i am sure she depend 
upon having it done lucy directly drew her workvtahle near her and resented herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could me no greater delight than in making a lillngree basket for a point child 
lady middle proposed a rubber of cousin to the others 
no one made any objection but variance who with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility exclaimed 1 your lady will have the goodness to excuse it 
you know i erect cards 
i shall go to the pianoforte 
i have not touched it since it was turned and without farther ceremony she turned away and walked to the instrument 
lady middle looked as if she thanked heaven that 11 had never made so rude a b 
a marriage can never keep long worn that moment you know madam a said eleanor endeavouring to smooth away the offence 
and i do not much wonder at it for it is the very beet-toned pianoforte i ever heard the remaining cave were now to draw their garden

i should like the work exceedingly if she would allow me a share in it a indeed i shall be very much obliged to you for your help a cried lucy for i and there in more to be done to it than i thought there viii 
and it would i a shocking thing to disappoint dear america after l. 
a oh 
that would be terrible indeed a said in steal 
a dear little about how i do love her 
a you are very kind aid lady middle w eleanor

perhaps you will be a well pleased no to cut in till another rubber or will you take your chance now i eleanor joyfully prompted by the rest of these pool and time by a little of that address which reliance could never condescend to mine gained her own end and pleased lady mild eton at the name tire 
lucy made room for her with nearly attention and the two fair rival were than mute side by side at the same table and with the utmost harmony engaged in forward in the name work

you have set my heart at ease by it 
for i was somehow or other afraid i had offended you by what i told us that monday 
a faded me 
how could you suppose so 
believe me a and finer spoke it wide the truest sincerity 
a nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea 
could you have a motive for the trust that was not honourable and muttering to me 
a a and yet i do assure you replied lucy her little sha eyes full of meaning there seemed to me to be a cow dress and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable 
i felt sure that you was angry with me 
and have been quarrelling with myself ever since for having work such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs 
but i am very glad to and it was only my own fancy and that you do not really blame me 
i you knew what a consolation it was no me to relieve my heart by speaking to you of what i am always thinking of every moment of my life your compassion would make you overlook everything else i am sure 
a indeed i can easily believe that it was i very great relief to you to acknowledge your situation to me and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it

lucy hit her lip and looked angrily at her time 
a mutual silence took place for some time 
lucy 1st put an end to it by saying in a lower tone though marriage was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto 
i will honestly tell on of one income which hat lately come into my head for bringing matter to bear 
indeed i am bound to let you into the secret for you are a party concerned 
i dare say you have been enough of edward to know that he would refer the church to every other profusion 
now my up an in that he should take orders as noon at he can and then through your interest which i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him and i hope out of come regard to me your brother i hit be persuaded to give him morland living 
which gulf understand it a very good one and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while 
that would be enough for us to marry upon a and we might trust to time and chance for the rest i should be always happy a lie eleanor to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for mr farm

at length lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh 
a i believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by resolving the engagement 
we seem so best with difficulties on every side that though it would make us miserable for a time we should be happier perhaps in the end 
but you will not give me your advice miss dashed 
not a answered eleanor with a smile which concealed vex agitated feeling on such a subject i certainly will not 
you know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you unless it were on the side of your wishes 
indeed you wrong me a replied lucy with great solemnity 
i know nobody of whose judgment i think so highly as i do of yours 
and do really believe that if you was to say to me a i advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with edward farmer it will be more for the happiness of both of you a i should resolve upon doing it immediately 
liquor blushed for the insincerity of edward future wife and he lit a this compliment would effectually fro hates me torn giving any opinion on the subject had i formed one 
it raises my innocence much too high 
the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for in indignant person 
t is because you are an indifferent person said lucy with some pique and laying a particular urged on those words 2 that your judgment might just 
have arch weight with me 
if you could he so to be passed in on me in your own feeling 5 none would not beywo‘rlihmhazing.” 3 you up

but i dare nay you will go for all that

how unlucky that in

to which both of them submitted without any reluctance for nothing had been said on either title to make them unlike each other less than they had done before 
and finer not down to the card-table with the melancholy petition that edward was not only without affection for the person who was to he his wife but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably hasp ye in marriage which sincere affection on m tide would have given for self-interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement of which the seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary 
sense and sensibility 
4 from this time the subject was never revived by eleanor 
and when entered on by lucy who seldom missed an open rarity of introducing it and was particularly care us to inform her confidante of her ha intense whenever she received a letter from end it was treated by the former with calmness and caution and dismissed as soon as civility would allow 
for she felt much conversations to be an indulgence which lucy did not deserve and which were dangerous to herself 
the visit of the miss sleepless at baron park was lengthened far beyond what the e invitation implied 
their favour increased they could not be spared 
sir john would not hear of their going 
and in ten of their numerous and long-arranged engagements in water in it of the absolute necessity of their returning to fulfil them immediately which was in full force at the end of every week they were prevailed on to stay nearly two months at the park and to assist in the due celebration of that festivity which requires a more than ordinary share of private balls and large dinner to proclaim its importance 
chapter 5 
though mrs beginnings was in the habit of spending a large region of the year at the houses of her chin dream and friends she was not without a settled habitation of her own 
since the death of her husband who had treated with succeed in a less elegant part of the town she had resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near portmanuare 
towards this home she began on the approach of january to turn her thoughts and thither she one day abruptly and very unexpectedly by them marked the iron sense and sensibility 
elder mien dalhwooda to accompany her 
liquor without observing the varying complexion of her litter and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the lane immediate gave a grateful but absolute denial for that in which he believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations 
the rein lodge was their determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of year 
man leaning received the refusal with some so l'lllc and repeated her invitation immediately 
so hard 
i am sure your mother can spare you very well and i do beg you will favour me with your company for love quite set 
my heart upon it 
don't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me for i sha n't put myself at all out 
of my way for you 
it will only be uendmgrbetty by the coach and i hope i an afford bar 
e three shall be able to go very well in my chaise 
and when we are in town if you do not like to go wherever i do well and good you may always go with one of my dear hen 
i am sure your mother will not object to it 
or i have had such good luck in getting my own children of 
my hands that the will think me a very lit pen to have the charge of you and if i do n't get one of you at lean well married before i have done with you it shall not be my fault 
i shall speak a good word for you to all the young men you may depend us no it 
i have a moon a laid sir john that in marriage would not object to such a scheme if her elder sister would come into it 
it in very hard indeed that 
she should not have a little pleasure became in wood does not 
wish it 
so i would advise you two to set of for town when on are tired of baron without saying a word to miauhwood about it 
a nay cried my joining i am sure i shall be monstrous glad of miss variance s company whether in dashed will go or not only the more durands an d sensibility 
i s i married say i and i thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together 
because if they got tired of me that might talk to one another and laugh at my odd ways hid my back 
but one or the other if not both of them i must have 
lord bless me how do you think i can live poking by myself i who have been always used till this winter to have charlotte with me 
come miss variance let us strike lands upon the bargain and if miss dashed will change her mind by-and~bye why so much the better 
i thank you ma'am sincerely thank you said marriage with warmth 
a our invitation has insulted my gratitude for ever an it would give me such ha press 
yes almost the greatest happiness i am capable c of to be able to accept it 
but my mother my dearest kindest mother 
— i feel the justice of what eleanor has urged and if she were to be made less happy less comfortable by our absence 
oh i no not me should tempt me to leave her 
it should not must not be a struggle 
mrs beginnings repeated her since that man dashed could spare them perfectly well 
and editor who now understood her sister and saw to what indifference to almost everything else she was carried by her eagerness to be with illoughby again made no farther direct opposition to the plan and merely referred it to her mother decision from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to vent a visit which she you d not approve of for anne and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid 
whatever marriage was desirous of her mother would be eager to promote 
she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust and she dared not ox on the motive of her own disinclination for going to london

you have been beating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you there in all one objection which in my opinion can not be to an remove 
billarianne s countenance lank

what formidable obstacle in she now to bring forward 
do not let me hear a word about the expense of it a my objection is thin though i think very well of my jenningn’ heart ached in not a woman who can afford a pleasure or whole protection will give in con hence 
hat in very true 1 replied her mother 
but of her society separately from that of other people you will scarcely have anything at all and on will almost always appear in public with lady i eton 1 if e nor in frightened away by her dislike of man leaning a said variance at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation 
i have no inch temples and i am sure i could at up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little son 
liquor could not help smiling at this display of difference towards the manner of a person to whom oh 
had often had difficulty in persuading marines to behave with tolerable politeness and resolved within herself 
that if her sister pierced in going she would go likewise a 
she did not think it proper that marriage should be left the sole guidance of her own judgment or that mrs join a should be pardoned to the mercy of arrange for all the comfort of her doomed home 
to this determination the was the more pain reconciled by recollecting that edward f enhance by lucy account 
was not to be in town before february and that their visit without any unreasonable abridger might be previously banished 
4 sense and slnslblllty 
i will have you my go a did mrs dalhwood 
a these objections are nonsensical 
you will have much pleasure in being in london and especially in being together 
and if eleanor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment she would foresee it there from a variety of sources 
she would perhaps expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister-in-law s family 
liquor had often wished for an opposite of attempting to weaken her mother dependence on the attachment of edward and herself that the shock might be the less when the whole truth were revealed and now on this attack though almost hopeless of success she forced herself to begin her design by saying as calmly as she could i like edward fears very much and shall always be glad to see him 
but as to the rest of the family it is a matter of fact indifference to me whether i am ever known to t am or not mrs. dashed smiled and said nothing 
variance lifted up her eyes in astonishment and finer conjectured that she might as well have held her tone after very little farther discourse it was finally settled that the invitation should be fully accepted 
mrs beginnings received the information with a great deal of joy and many assurances of kindness and care 
nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her 
sir john was delighted 
for to a man whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of being alone the acquisition of two to the number of inhabitants in london was something 
even lady middle took the trouble of being delighted which was putting herself rather out of her way 
and as for the miss stables especially lucy they had never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence made them 
liquor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected to feel 
with regard to herself it was now a sense and sensibility 
s 5 matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not 
and when due saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan and her sister exhilarated by it in look voice an manner restored to all her usual animation and elevated to more than her usual gaiety the could not be dissatisfied with the cause and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence 
marines joy was almost a degree beyond happiness no great was the perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone 
her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness 
and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive 
her mother affection was hardly less and editor was the only one of the three who seemed to consider the separation as anything short of eternal 
their departure took place in the first week in january 
the middletons were to follow in about a week 
the miss stables kept their station at the park and were to quit it only with the rest of the family 
better he 
t a minor could not and herself in the carried with mrs leaning and beginning a hometo london under her protection and as her guest without wondering at her own situation so short had their acquaintance with that lady been 
so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition and so many had been her objections against such a measure only a few days before i but these objection had all with that ha window of youth which arising and her mother quell 
shared been overcome or overlooked 
and liquor in spite of every occasional doubt of will by constancy could not witness the rapture of delightful exert ay as all ssnsraltrrv 
plantation which filled the whole soul and bonnet in the eyes variance without feeling how blank was her own prospect how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison and how gladly she would engage in the solitude of msrianne’s situation to have the lame animating object in view the urn possibility of hope 
a short a very than time however must now dead what willoughhy’s intentions were in all probability he was already in town 
marines eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there 
and editor was resolved not only upon gaining every 
new light as to his character which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention as to ascertain what he was and what he meant before many meetings had taken place 
should the result of her observations he unfavourable she was determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister 
should it be otherwise her exertions would he of a different nature 
she must then learn to avoid every selfish comparison and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of marines 
they were three days on their journey and mariannc’s behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what her future complained and companionableness to mrs beginnings might be expected to be 
she sat in silence almost all the way wrapt in her own meditations and scarcely ever voluntarily speaking except when any object of picturesque beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively addressed to her sister 
to atone for this conduct 
therefore eleanor took immediate possession of the of civility which she had designed herself behaved with the greatest attention to mrs beginnings talked with her laughed with her and listened to her whenever she could 
and mrs evenings on her side treated them both base and sensibility 
15 with all possible kindness was solicitous on over soon for their ease and enjoyment and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their own dinners at the inn nor extort a confession of their preferring daemon to cloud or boiled fools to veal countless 
reached town by three o'clock the third day glad to be released after such a journey from the confinement of 
carriage and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good he 
the house wan handsome and handsomely fitted up and the young ladies were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment 
it had formerly been charlotte and over the mantelpiece still hung a landscape in coloured spikes of her performance in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect 
as dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their arrival eleanor determined to employ the interval in writing to her mother and sat down for that purpose 
in a few moments variance did the same 
i am writing home arrange a said eleanor 
had not you better defer your letter for a day or two 2 1 i am not going to write to my mother a replied variance hastily and as if wishing to avoid an farther inquiry 
liquor said no more 
it immediately mock her that she must then be writing to willoughby and the conclusion which as instantly followed was that however mysteriously they might winds to conduct the affair the must be engaged 
this conviction though not entire ye satisfactory gave her pleasure and she continued her letter with greater alacrity 
marines was finished in a very few minutes 
in length it could be no more than a note it was then folded up sealed in directed with eager witty 
liquor thought she could distinguish a large in the direction and no sooner was it complete then msriunne ringing the bell 
rest sense and sbnslblllty 
quitted the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed for her to the penny post 
this decided the matter at once 
her spirits still continued very high but there was a matter in them which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister and this agitation accused as the evening drew on 
she could scarcely eat any dinner and when they afterwards returned to the drawing-room seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage 
it was a great satisfaction to minor that mrs beginnings by being much engaged in her own room could see little of what was passing 
the ten things were brought in and already had variance been disappointed more than once by a rise at a neighbouring door when a loud one was sudden ye heard which could out be mistaken for one at an other house 
liquor felt secure of its announcing illoughby s approach and marriage starting up moved towards the door 
everything was silent 
this could not be borne many seconds she opened the door advanced a few steps towards the stairs and after listening half a minute returned into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce 
in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming do plainer it is willoughhy indeed it is 
2 and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms when colonel grandson a red 
it was too great a shock to be borne wixteaoslmness and she immediately left the room 
editor was distant pointed too 
but at the same time her regard for colonel grandson inured his welcome with her and she felt regularly hurt that a man partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him 
she instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him that he even observed sense 
and sensibility 
19 marriage so she quitted the room with such punishment and concern as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself 
is your sister ill 
a said he 
liquor snow in some distress that she was end then talked of head-aches low-spiritn and over-fatigues 
and of everything to which she could recently attribute her sister s behaviour 
he heard her with the most earnest mention but seeming to recollect himself said no more on the subject and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in london making the usual in cities about their journey and the friends they had left he rid 
in this calm kind of way with very little intent on either side they continued to talk both of them out of s rites and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere 
liquor wished very much to ask whether willoughby were then in town but she was afraid of giving him by any inquiry after his rival 
and at length by way of saying something she asked if he had been in london ever since she had seen him last 
yes 1 he he lived with some embarrassment 1 almost ever since 
i have been once or twice at holford for a few days but it has never been in my power to return to pardon 
this and the manner in which it was said immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place with the business and suspicions they had caused to mrs. leaning and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt 
mrs beginnings soon came in 
so closely 
said she with her usual noisy cheerfulness a i am monstrous glad to see you 
sorry i could not come before 
beg yougardon but 
i have been forced to look about me s life e and settle my matters

a world of little odd thing 
to do after one been away for any time 
and then i have had birthright to settle with 
lord i have been at truly a a been ever since dinner 
but am colonel how came you to conjecture out that i should be in town to-day 2 i had the pleasure of hearing it at r. aylmers where i have been pining for

how does charlotte do 
i warrant you she it a one size by thin time 
a mrs. paler appeared quite well and x urn commissioned to tell you that you will certainly tease her tomorrow 1 ay to be sure i thought much 
well colonel i have brought two young ladies with me you dog 
till it you see but one of them now but there in another somewhere 
your friend in marriage too

i do not know what you and mr. willoughby will do between you about her 
ay it it a one thing to young and handsome

i was young once but i never wan very handsome wan luck for me 
however i got a very good husband and i don't know what the grated beauty do more 
ah 
poor man 
he hatbeendead these eight years and better 
but colonel where have you been to since we parted 
and how does your business go on 
come come let i have no secrets among friends he replied with his accustomed mildness to all her inquiries but without satisfying her in any 
liquor now began to make the tea 
and marriage veal obliged to appear again 
after her entrance colonel grandson became more thoughtful and silent than he had been before and 
joining could not prevail on him to my long 
no other visitor appeared that evening and the father were inanimate in agreeing to go early to bed sense and sensibility 
16 
variance rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks 
the disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the expectation of what wan to he that day 
they had not long finished their oh before mrs aylmers barouche stopped the door and in a few minutes she came laughing into the room 
to delighted to see them all that it was hard to any whether she received most pleasure from meeting her mother or the miss woods again 
so surprised at their common to town though it was what she had neither expected along 
so angry at their accepting her mother invitation after having declined her own though it the same time she would never have forgiven them if they had not come 
a mr paler will be so 11 my to see you a aid the

a after an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat or in other words in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on in jennings’s side and in laughter without candle on my paler it was proposed by the latter that they should i all accompany her to some shops where she had busineuthnt mamma to which man leaning and finer readily contented as having likewise some purchases to make theme 
and a one though declining it at first was induced to go likewise 
wherever they went she won evidently many on the watch 
in bond-street especially where much of their business lay her eyes were in contact inquiry 
and in whatever shop the party were engaged her mind w equally abstained from everything actually before them from all that interested and occupied the other

was only impatient to he at home again and could with direct my govern her vexation at the seriousness of cramer whose eye was caught by everything pretty expensive or new 
who was wild to buy all could determine on none and guided away her time in rare and indecision 
it was late in the morning before they returned home 
and no sooner had they entered the house than marriage drew eagerly upstairs and when eleanor followed the found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance which declared that no willoughhy had been there 
a has no letter been left here for me since we went out 9 a said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels 
she was answered in the negative 
a are you quite sure of it 13 she replied 
are you certain that no mean no partner has left any letter or note 3 the man replied that none had 
a how very odd said she in a low and disappointed voice as she turned away to the window 
a how odd indeed 
a repeated eleanor within herself regarding her sister with uneasiness 
a if she had not known him to he in town she would not have written to him as she did 
she would have written to corners negus 
and if he is in town how odd that he should neither come nor write

marriage was of no use on these occasions 
as she would never learn the game 
but though her time was therefore at her own disposal the evening wan by no man more productive of place to her nun to minor for it was spent in all the anxiety of expect trio and the air of dim intent 
she sometimes endeavoured or a few minutes to read

for although nearer settled in town sir john had contrived to collect around him nearly twenty young life and to amuse them with a ball 
this won an m however of which lady middle did not approve 
in the country an unpremeditated dance was very allowable 
but in london 
where the reputation of elegance was more important and less cabin obtained it was talking too much for the gratification of a few girls to have it known that lady middle had given a small dance of eight or nine couple with two villains and a mere sideboard collation 
mr and mrs paler were of the city

variance gave one glance round the apartment as he entered 
it was enough be was not there

after they had been assembled about an hour mr paler sauntered toward the main dahwooda to express his inn-price on seeing them in town though colonel grandson had been at informed of their arrival at his home and he had himself aid something very droll on hearing that they were to come

so my daughter middle told me for it ice sir john met him nowhere in the street thin morning 
variance paid no more but looked exceedingly hurt 
impatient in this intimation to be doing something that might lead to her fingers relief eleanor resolved to write the next morning to her mother and hoped by waking her fear for the health of marines to procure these inquiries which had been to long delayed 
and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after hreakﬁwl on the sorrow that marriage was again writing to willoughby for the could not pursue it to he to any other pen 
but the middle of the day an ending went out b herself on hunting and editor began her letter directly 
while variance too reader employment too anxious for conversation walked from one window to the other or sat down by the tree in melancholy meditation

and for this party net wholly dispirited careless of her appearance and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or mind without one look of hope or one expression of place

after one time spent in saying little and doing leaf lady middle let down to cabin and a marriage was not in spirit for moving about she and finer luckily succeeding to chain placed themselves at no great distance from the table 
they had not remained in this manner long before eleanor perceived willoughby standing within a few yards of them in earnest conversation with a very fashionable-looking young woman 
she soon caught his eye and he immediately bowed but without attempting to freak to her or to approach variance though he ca d not but see her 
and then continued his discourse with the lame lady 
editor turned involuntarily to marriage to ice whether it could be unobserved by her

he hoped and addressing himself rather to plainer than a no as if wishing to avoid her eye and determined not to observe her attitude inquired in a hurried manner after mrs dashed and asked how long they had been in town 
editor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address and was unable to say a word 
but the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed 
her face was crimson over and she exclaimed in i voice of the greatest emotion good god ll willoughby what is the meaning of this 
have you not received my letters 
will you not shake hands with me 
he could not then avoid it but her touch seemed insult to him and he held her hand only for a moment 
using ill this time he was evidently struggling for composure 
liquor watched his countenance and saw its expression becoming more tranquil 
after a moment's use he spoke with calmness

for heaven sake tell me what is the matter 
he made no reply 
his complexion changed and all his embarrassment returned 
but as if on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking he felt the necessity of instant exertion he recovered himself again and after saying a yes i had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town which you were so as to send to me turned hastily sway with a light how and joined his friend

a a short time eleanor saw willoughbﬁ quit the room by the door towards the staircase and me in marriage that he was gone urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that evening as a fresh argument for her to be calm

it was some minutes before the could go on with her letter and the frequent hum of grief which still obliged her at intervals to withhold her pen were proof enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that the was writing for the last time to willoughby

and seating herself on the bed took her hand kissed her affectionately several times and then gave way to a burst of tears which at me was scarcely less violent than marines

and he was silently grieving over the impudence which had handed lock solicited roof of tenderness not wanted by anything preceding and mot severely condemned by the event when variance perceiving that the had finished the letters observed to her that they contained nothing but what any one would have written in the lame situation

nor advised her to lie down again and for a moment he did 10 
but no attitude could give her cup 26 sense and swsruru’rv 
and in restless pain of mind and body the mud from one posture to another till growing more and more hysterical her litter could with difficulty keen her on the bed at all and for name time wan fearful of being constrained to call for admittance 
some lavender drops however which the was at length persuaded to take were of use 
and from that time till man leaning 
returned the continued on the bed quiet and motionless 
chasm was 
as sending came immediately to their room on her return and without waiting to have her request of admittance answered opened the door and walked in with a look of real concern 
a how do you do m dear 
a said she in a voice of great companion to dinner who turned away her face without after taking to answer 
a how in she in daahwood 
poor thing 
the look very bad 
no wonder 
ay it is but too true 
he ll to be married very noon 
a good-for-nothing fellow 
i have no patience with him 
my taylor told me of it half an hour ago and the was told it by a particular friend of mist grey herself else i am sure i should not have believed it 
and i was almost ready to like a it wan 
well said i all i can lay in that 
if it is true he has used a young lad of my acquaintance abornimbly ill and i wish with my soul his wife my plague hall heart out 
and so i shall always lay my dear you may depend on it 
i have no notion of mental going on in this way 
and if ever i meet him again i will give him such a dressing as he has not had thin many a day 
but there ii one comfort my dear mix variance 
he in not the only young man in the world sense and sensibility 
27 worth having 
and with your pretty face you will never want admirers 
well poor thing 
i went disturb her my longer for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with it 
the carrying andersons luckily are coming to-night you know and that will amuse her 
she then went away walking on to the out of the room as if she so passed her young friend's sillictiou could be increased ye noise 
v marines to the rise of her sister determined on diningwith them 
nor even advised her against it 
but a no she would go down 5 she could bear it very well and the bustle about her would be less eleanor pleased to have her governed flora moment by such a motive though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner said no more 
and autumn hardest for hers well as she could while variance remained on the bed was ready to assist her into the dining-room up soon as they were summoned to it 
when there though looking most wretchedly she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected 
had she tried to speak or had she been conscious of half mrs gleaning s s well-meant but ill-judged attentions to her this firmness could not have been maintained 
but not a syllable escaped her lips and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of everything that as using before her 
e nor who did justice to mrs jennings’s kindness though its effusions were often distressing and sometimes almost ridiculous made her those acknowledgments 
and returned her those civilities 
which her sister could not make or return for herself 
their good friend saw that 
marriage was unhappy and felt that everything was due to her which might make her at all less so 
she treated her therefore with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of its 18 sense and sensibility 
holidays 
marriage was to have the best place by the fire watson betemptedto eat hyeverydeliucyin the house and to be unused by the relation of all the news of the day 
had not liquor in the sad countenance of her sister seen a check all mirth she could have been entertained by mrs beginnings s endeavours to cure 3 appointment in love 
by s variety of twelve and of ives and a good fire 
as noon however no the consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on variance she could stay no longer 
with an hasty exclamation of misery an a sign to her sister not to follow her she directly got up and hurried out of the room 
a poor soul i 
cried my bearings as soon as she was gone a how it gives me to see her 
and i declare if the is not gone away without unyielding her wine and the dread cherries too 
lord 
nothing seems to do her any good 
i am sure if i knew of anything she would like i would send all over the town for it 
well it is the odd thing to me that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill 
but when there is plenty of money on one side and next to none on the other lord bless you 
there no more about such things 1 
2 the lady then 
mist grey i think you called her 
— is very rich 
a fifty thousand pounds my dear 
did you ever see her 
a smart missish girl the lay but not handsome 
i remember her aunt very well bid henshawe 
the married a very wealthy man 
but the family are all rich together 
fifty thousand pounds 
and by all accounts it don't come before it is wanted 
for they say he is all to pieces 
no wonder 
dashing about with his curricle and hunger 
well it done at if talking 
but when i young man be he who he will comes and makes love to a pretty girl and promises marriage he has no business to fly off from his word only brute sense and sensibility

why on t he in and a cut tell hit llul’iel let hit house turn of hit tenants and make a thorough reform at once 
i warrant a mist marriage would have been ready to wait till mattercnme round

nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this again a do you know what kind of t girl mist grey it

and t pretty choice the ill

heir own good-nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know anything about it when the in recent 
and the led that may ever be mad to m reel on the subject the more my feelings will be park at you my dear madam will easily believe no words yes that i do indeed 
it must be terrible for you to hear it talked of

found at the expected in her own room leaning in silent misery over the small remains of a tree which till elinor’e entrance had been only light 
you had better leave me a was all the notice that her litter received from her 
a i will leave you a said editor of you will go to bed but this from the momentary pervenenen of impatient murdering the at first refused to do 
her bitter earnest though gentle 
persuasion however moon offered her to compliance and finer saw her lay her aching head on the pillow and now her an the hoped in a way to get some quiet rate before the left her 
in the drawing-room whither the then repaired the was soon joined by an ending with wine-glue full of something in her hand 
a my dear laid the entering i have just recollect that i have some of the nest old constantly wine in the home that ever wanted 
so i have brought a glass of it for your litter 
my poor husband how fond he was of it 
whenever he had a touch of hit old clock gout he laid it did him more good than anything job in the world 
do take it to your linen dear madam replied eleanor smiling at the difference of the company for which it was recommended how good you are 
but i have just left arrange in bed and i hope almost asleep 
and up i think sense arm sbnsibhjty

and linger at the loved the chief of it reflected that thou m in good erect on a cholickygout were at present a little importance to her in potent on a disappointed hem might be at reasonably tried on herself at on her time 
colonel grandson came in while the were at tea and by hit manner of looking round room for marriage eleanor immediate fancied that he neither expected nor wished to ice her there and in than that he was already aware of what occurred her absence 
mr joining wet not struck by the tame thought 
for noon after hit entrance the walked wrote the room to the temple where eleanor presided and whispered 
the colonel look at grave at ever you see 
he knows nothing of it 
do tell him my dear 
he shortly afterward drew a chair close to here and with a look which perfectly assured her of hit good information enquired after her sir 
a arrange it not well a said the 
a she hat been wander andwehavepertuaded heroism perhaps then he hesitatingly replied what i heard this morning nay he true 
there may be more truth in it than i could believe pot-'hle at in what did you hear

quedoknowittl thitteelntrohtvebeen i ii 
c 14 sense and sensibility 
day of general elucidation for this very morning 1st unfolded it to in 
mr willoughby is unfathomable 
where did you hear it 
a in a stationary shop in all wall where i bad business 
two ladies were waiting for their carriage and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match in a voice so little attempting concealment that it was impossible for me not to hear all 
the name of willoughhy john willaughby fervently repeated lit caught my attention and what for owed was a positive assertion that everything was now finally settled respecting his marriage with miss c 
it was no longer to be a secret 
it would take 5 
face even within a few weeks with many particulars of up on and other matters 
one thing especially 
remember because it served to rectify the man still more 
— as soon as the ceremony was over they were to go to come man his seat in somersetshire 
my astonishment 
but it would be impossible to describe what i felt 
the communicative lady i learnt an enquiry for i staid in the shop till they were gone was a mrs prison and that as i have been since informed is the name of miss grey guardian 1 it is 
but have you likewise heard that miss grey has fifty thousand pounds in that if in anything we may and an explanation 
a it may be so 
but willoughby is capable 
at least i think 
— he stopped a moment 
then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself a and your sister how did shelf 1 her sufferings have been very severe 
i have only to hope that they my be proportionably short 
it has been it it a most cruel affliction 
till yesterday i believe she never doubted his regard 
and even now perhaps 
but i am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her 
he has been very deceitful 
sense and sum as sad in some points there seems a hardness fears about him 
ah i a said colonel grandson 1 there is indeed 
but your sister does not 
i think you said so 
she does not consider it quite as you do in a you know her disposition and may believe how a cry she would still justify him if she could 
e made no answer 
and soon afterwards by the removal of the tea things and the arrangement of the card the subject was necessarily mrs beginnings who had watched them with pleasure while the were talking and who expected to see the effect of its dashwood’s communication in such an instantaneous gaiety on colonel brandon’s side as might have become a man in the bloom of youth of hope and happiness saw him with amazement remain the whole evening more serious and thoughtful than usual 
«eb-9m 5 room i night of more sleep than she had expected f variance awoke the next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had closed her eyes 
liquor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt 
and before breakfast was ready they had gone through the subject again and again 
with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on eleanor's side the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on marines as before 
sometimes she could believe willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself and at others lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him 
at one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all 16 sense and sensibility 
the world it mother she would elude herself from it for ever and at a third could resist it with energy 
in one thing however she was uniform when it come to the point in avoiding where it was possible the presence of mrs leaning and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it 
her heart was hardened against the belief of mrs jennings’s entering into her sorrows with any compassion 
a no no no it can not be a she cried 
she can not feel 
her kindness is not sympathy 
her good-nature is not tenderness 
all that she wants is gossip and she only likes me now because i supply it liquor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others by the irritable refinement of her own mind and the too great importance placed by her on the delicacy of a strong sensibility and the graces of a polished manner 
like half the rest of the world if more than half there be that are clever and good marriage with excellent abilities and an excellent disposition was neither reasonable nor candid 
she expected from other place the name opinions and feelings as her own and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself 
thus a circumstance occurred while the sisters were together in their own room after bmaltfatt which sunk the heart of mrs beginnings still lower in her estimation 
because through her own weakness it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself though mrs beginnings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost good-will 
with a letter in her stretched hand and countenance gaily smiling from the persuasion of bringing comfort she entered their room saying 
— a now my dear i bring you something that i am sure will do you good 
variance heard enough 
in one moment her images and srnsxbilh'y 
3 inaction placed before her a letter from without by full of tender and contrition explanatory of a that had satisfactory convincing 
and instantly followed willoughb herself rushing eagerly into the room to force at her feet by the offence of hit eyed the france of his letter 
the work of one moment was delayed by the next 
the handwriting of her mother never till then unwelcome wan before her 
and in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an ecstasy of more than none the felt as if till that instant the had never suffered 
the cruelty of mrs beginnings no language within her reach in her moment of happiest eloquence could have expressed 
and now the could reproach her only by the tent which screened from her eyes with parsonage violence 
a knock however so entirely lost on its object that 5 many expression of pity the withdrew still referring her to the letter for comfort 
but the letter when the was calm enough to read it broke hat little comfort 
willoughby called every page 
her mother still confident of her engagement and relying a warmly at ever on his constancy had only been roused by elinor’t application to centre from nine greater openness toward them both and thin with such tenderness toward her such affection for willoughby and each a conviction of their future happiness in each other that the wept with agony through the whole of it 
all her impatience m be at home again now returned 
her mother wan dearer to her than ever 
dearer through the very excess of her mistake confidence in willing and he was wild urgent to be gone 
liquor unable e herself to determine whether it were better for marriage to be in london or at baron offered no counsel of her own excess of patience till their mother s wieheeeauld could be now 
and at length the obtained her sisters content to wait for that knowledge 
3 sense and sensibility 
man leaning left them earlier than none 
for die cmrldnotbeeuytillthemiddletom and palmeriwere able to grieve in much an herself and positive renting elinor’e offered attendance went out alone for the rent of the morning 
liquor with a very heavy heart aware of the in the will going to communicate and perceiving by annexed letter how ill the had proceeded in laying any foundation for it then eat down to write her mother an account of what had paused and intreat her direction for the future 
while variance who came into the drawing-room on my jenninga’l going away remained vexed at the table where eleanor wrote watching the advancement of her pen grieving over her for the hardship of inch a task and grieving mill more fondly over its effect on her mother 
in thin manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour when marriage when never could not then bear any sudden noise war startled by a rap at the door 
a who can this be 
a cried eleanor 
a so early too 
i thought we bad been care variance moved to the window 
a it is colonel grandson 1 a said the with vexation 
2 we are never safe from jar 
a he will not come in as mrs denying it from home a i will not me to bear retreating to her own room 
a a man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of other 
the event proved her conjecture right though it was founded on injustice and error for colonel grandson did come in 
and editor who was convinced that solitude for marriage brought him thither and who raw beat solitude in hit disturbed and melancholy look and in hit anxious though brief inquiry after her could not forgive her sister for entering him an lightly

3 1 i met my joining in bond street a laid he offer the list caution and who encouraged me to come on 
and i was the more easily encouraged became i thought it probable that i might and you alone which i was very dim

i think i am justiﬁedé-though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that i am right in there not name reason to fear i may be wrong 2 
he stopped 
a i understand you a said eleanor 
a you have something to tell me of mr willoughby that will open hit character farther 
your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shown no variance 
my gratitude will be insulted immediately by any infornuﬁon tending to that end and be must be gained by it in time 
pray my let me hear it

and to be brief when i quitted baron last october

he stopped a moment for recollection and then with another night went on 
a you have probably entirely forgotten a conversation 
it i. not to be supposed that it could make any impmnon on you 
of conversation between us one no sense and sensibility 
evening at button park 
it war the evening of a dance 
in which i alluded to a lady i had once known as resembling in some measure your sister variance 
and a answered eleanor i have not forgotten it he looked pleased by this remembrance and added 
a if i am not deceived by the uncertainty the partiality of tender recollection there is a very many resemblance between them as well in mind as person the name warmth of heart the same eagerness of fancy and spirits 
thin lady was one of my nearest relations an orphan from her infancy and under the guardianship of my father 
our ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years we were plan how 
and friend 
i can not remember the time when did not love eliza 
and my affection for her as we grew up was arch as perhaps judging from my present forlorn and cheerlegmvityhyou might think me since blue of having ever eat 
ran for me was i believe fervent up the attachment of your sister to mr willoughby and it was though from a different cause no less unfortunate 
at seventeen she was lost to me for ever 
she was married 
married against her inclination to my brother 
her fortune wan large and our family estate much encumbered 
and this i fear is all that can be paid for the conduct of one who war at once her uncle and guardian 
my brother did not deserve her 
he did not even love her 
i had hoped that her regard for me would so it her under any difficult and for some time it is 
— but at last the misery of her situation for she experienced great unkindness overcame all her resolution and though she had promised name that nothing 
but how blind i relate ll have never told you how this war brought on 
we were within a few hours of groping together for scotland 
the treachery or the folly of my cousin 
maid betrayed us 
i was sense and seusrmu’nv‘ 
or banished to the house of a relation far distant and she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement till my father s point was gained 
i had depended on her fortitude too far and the blow was a severe one 
but had her marriage been happy so young as i then was a few months must have reconciled me to it or at least i should not have new to lament it 
this however was not the one 
my brother had no regard for her his pleasures were not what they ought to have been end from the first he treated her kindly 
the consequence of this a a mind so young so lively so inexperienced as he grandson s was but too natural 
she herself at first to all the misery of her situation 
and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned 
but can we wonder that with such a husband to provoke inconstancy and without a friend to advise or restrain her for my father lived only s few months after their marriage and i was with m regiment in the east indies she should fall 
had remained in england perhaps 
but i meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years and for that purpose had procured my exchange 
the shock which her marriage had given me a he continued in a voice of great agitation 
was of training weight 
— was nothing 
to what i felt when i heard about two years afterwards of her divorce 
it was box 
which threw this gloom 
even now the recollection of what i suffered 
he could so no more and rising still walked for a few minutes a at the room 
liquor a bed by his relations and still more by his distress could not speak 
he saw her concern and coming to her took her hand pressed it and kissed it with grateful respect 
a few minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure 
2 sense and sensibility 
a it was nearly three year after this unhappy period before i returned to england 
my first care when i did arrive was of course to seek for her 
but the search wan as fruitless a. it wan melancholy 
i could not trace her beyond her first saucer and there wan every moon to fear that the had removed from him only to think deeper in a life of sin 
her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance and i learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person 
he imagined and calmly could he imagine it that her extravagance and consequent distress had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief 
at in however and after i had been six months in england i m and her 
regard for a former servant of my own who had since fallen into misfortune carried me to visit him in a apunging-houae where he wan confined for debt 
and there in the same house under a similar confinement was my unfortunate linger 
so altered 
ca faded 
tom down by acute suffering of every kind 
hardly could i believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me to be the remain of the lovely blooming healthful girl on whom i had once doated 
what i endured in so beholding her 
but i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it 
i have pained you too much already 
that the was to all appearance in the lamp 
stage of a consumption wan 
yet in such a situation it was my great comfort 
life could do nothing for her beyond giving time for a better preparation for death 
and that wan given 
i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings and under proper attendants 
i visited her every day during the rent of her short life was with her in her at moments 
again he stopped to recover itself 
and finer sense and sensibility 
a of he her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern it the fate of his unfortunate friend 
your sister i hope can not be offend a said he by the resemblance i have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation 
their faces their fortunes can not be the same 
and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a farmer mind or a happier marriage she might have been all that you will live to see the other be 
but to what does all this lead 
i seem to have been distressing you for nothing 
ah 
miss dashed 
a subject such as this 
untouched for fourteen years 
it is dangerous to handle it at all 
i will be more collected 
more concise 
she left to my care her only little child a little girl the offspring of her first guilty connection who was then about three years old 
she loved the child and had always kept it with her 
it was a valued a precious trust to me 
and gladly would i have discharged it in the strictest sense by watching over her education myself had the nature of our situations allowed it 
but i had no family no home 
and my little eliza was therefore placed at school 
i saw her there whenever i could and after the death of my brother which happened about ever years ago and which left me the on of the family my pet pity she frequently visited me at holford 
i called her a distant relation 
but 1 am well aware that i have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her 
it is now three year 
ago she had cut reached her fourteen year that i removed her form school to place her under the care of a very respectable woman residing in dorsetshire who had the charge of four or have other girls of about the same time of life 
and for two years i had every reason to be pleased with her situation 
but last february almost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared 
i had allowed her imprudence a it my sins 
and sensibility 
huainoemmdout athereamertdeeire forgot bath with one of her young friend who wan attending her father there for hit health 
iknewhim to he very good sport of man and 1 than hot well of his daughter 
better than she deserved or with a most obstinate and ill-judged merely the would tell nothing would give no clue though the certainly knew all 
he her father 
a well 
meaning but not a quicksighted man could really i believe give no information 
for he had been generally confined to the home while the girl were hanging over the town and making what acquaintancean they chose 
and he tried to convince me a thoroughly no he war convinced himself of his daughter being entirely unconcerned in the hardness 
in short i could learn nothing but that the man gone 
all the rent for eight long month wan left to conjecture 
what i thought what i failed may be imagined 
and what i suffered too good heavens cried eleanor could it he 
could willoughby 
just the first news that reached me of her a he continued came in a letter from behalf late october 
it was forwarded to me from hereford and i received it on the very morning of our intended party to whiten 
and this war the remains of my leaving baron to suddenly which i am sure must at the time have animal image to everybody and which i believe gave thence to name 
little did mr willoughhy imagine i suppose when his look censured me for incivility in breaking up the party that i wan called away to the relief of one whom he had made m and miserable 
but ball be known it what wonltlpi’lj have availed 
would he have been gay or less happy in the rules of your sister 
no he ha already done that which no man who can feel for another would do 
he had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had sense and sensibility 
4 seduced in a situation of the utmost distress with no creditable home no help no friends ignorant of his address 
he had left her promising to return 
he neither returned nor wrote nor replied her this is beyond everything 
exclaimed eleanor 
a his character it now before you 
expensive dissipated and worse than both 
knowing all this at i hen now known it many weeks guess what i must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever and on being assured that the was to marry him 
guess what i must have felt for all your sakes 
when 1 came to you last week and found you alone i came determined to know the truth thou he irresolute what to do when it must known 
my behaviour must have seemed strange to you then 5 but now you will comprehend it 
to suffer you ill to be so deceived 
to see your sister 
but what could i do 
i had no hope of interfering with accent 
and sometimes i thought your sister s influence might yet reclaimed him 
but now after such dishonourable usage who can tell what were his eggs on her 
whatever they may have been however the may now and hereafter doubtless mix turn with gratitude towards her own condition when she compress it with that of my poor lie when the considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this 5 girl and her to herself with in affection or him at strong still at strong as her own and with a mind tormented by self-reproach which must attend her through life 
surely this comparison must have its use with her 
she will feel her own sufferings to be nothing 
they proceed from no misconduct and can bring no disgrace 
on the contrary every friend must be made still more her friend by them 
concern for her unhappiness and respect for her fortitude under it must strengthen every attachment 
use your own discretion however in communicating to her what i have told you 
you must know best what of sense and smsrsrurv 
will beineffect 
but had notseriouslysndfrom my heart believed it might be of service might lessen her regrets i would not have suffered ran self to trouble you with this account of my family a actions with s recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others 
eleanor's thanks followed this speech with grateful enrnesurest 
attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to marriage from the communication of what had passed 
a i have been more pained a said she a by her endeavours to a pit him than by all the mat 
for it imitate her in more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthily can do 
now though at first she will suffer much i am sum she will soon become easier 
have on a she continued after 1 short silence a ever seen mr willoughhy since you left him at pardon i a yes 1 he replied gravely once i have 
one meeting was unavoidable 
liquor startled by his manner looked at him anxiously saying 
— a what 
have you met him to 
a i could meet him in no other way 
eliza had confessed to me though most reluctantly the name of her lover 
and when he returned to town which was within a fortnight after myself we met by a instrument he to defend i to punish his conduct 
e much unbounded and the meeting therefore never got abroad eleanor sighed over the fancied necessity of thin 
but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it 
a such a said colonel grandson after a. pause 1 has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter 
and so imperfectly have i discharged my trust 
a sense and sensibility 
4 2 is she still in town i a knot 
as soon as she recovered from her lying-in for i found her near her delivery i removed her and her child into the country and there she remained recollecting soon afterwards that he was probably dividing eleanor from her sister he put an end to kill visit receiving from her again the urn grateful acknowledgments and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him 
that my 
hen the particulars of this conversation were repeated by miss dashed to her sister an very soon were their effect on her was entire 
such as e former had hoped to see 
not that manner appeared to direct the truth of any part of it for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention made neither objection nor remark pattern bed no vindication of willoughby and seemed to shew yes her tears that she felt it to be impossible 
but though this behaviour assured eleanor that the conviction his guilt emma carried home to her mind 
they d she saw with satisfaction the effect of it in her no anger avoiding colonel grandson when he called in her speaking to him even voluntarily speaking with it kind of compassionate respect and though she saw her spirits lest violently irritated than before 
the did not see her less wretched 
her mind did become settled but it was settled in a gloomy dejection 
she felt the loss of willoughhy’s character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart

she m commended it to her daughters therefore by all m not to shorten their visit to mr beginnings 
the length of which though never exactly vexed had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks variety of occupations 
of object and of company which could not be procured at baron would be invited 
while there and i t yet she hoped that variance at melt into come interest beyond herself and even into some amusement much an the idea of both might now be roused by her 
sense and sensibility 
4 from all danger of seeing willoughby again her mother considered her to be at least equally safe in town as in the country since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all who call themselves her friends 
design could never bring them in each other way 
negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise 
and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of london than even in the retirement of baron where it might force him before her while par g that visit at allenharn on his marriage which mrs gnuhwood from 
foreseeing at first as a probable event had brought herself to expect as a certain one 
she had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were 
a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of february and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother 
marriage had promised to be guided by her mother opinion and she submitted to it therefore without opposition though it proved perfectly different from what she wished and expected though she felt it to be entirely wrong formed on mistaken grounds and that by requiring her longer continuance in london it deprived her of the only possible alleviation of her wretchedness the personal sympathy of her mother and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent her ever know a moment rest 
but it was a matter of great consolation to her that what broughtevil to herself would bring good to her sister 
and liquor on the other hand suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid edward entirely comforted herself by thinking that though their longer stay would therefore military against her own happiness it would be better for marriage than an immediate return into devonahire

early in february within a fortnight from the receipt of willoughby’o letter liquor had the painful office of informing her sister that he was married 
she had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to herself at noon at it war known that the ceremony was over as the was desirous that marriage should not receive the list notice of it from the public papers which the saw her eagerly examining every morning 
she received the new with resolute composure

about this time the two miss stables late 
arrived at their cousin's house in bartlett’s buildings elbow presented themselves again before their more grand relations in conduct and berkeley-street and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality 
linger only was sorry to see them 
their presence always gave her pain and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of lucy in finding her mill in town 
a should have been quite disappoint if i had not found you here mill said she he readily with a song emphasis on the word 
a but i ways thought i could 
i was almost sure you would not leave london it while 
though you told me you know at baron t you should not stay above a month 
but i thought at the time that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point 
it would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came 
and now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone 
i am amazingly glad you did not keep to your ward 
liquor directly understood her and was forced to use all her sell command to make it appear that she did not 
well my dear said mrs beginnings 2 and how did you travel

i suppose you go and stay with your brother and sister miss dashed when they come to town laid lucy returning after a elevation of possible hint to the charge

a what a charming thing it it that man stood can a are you both for so long a time together 
a a long a time indeed i

i think she might see such and i on are we would not speak 3 word 
liquor with great civility declined the proposal 
a her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed or in her dressing-gown an therefore not able to come to them 
oh if that all cried miss steal we can just as well go and see her editor began to and this impertinence too much for her temper 
but she was saved the trouble of checking it by lucy sharp reprimand which now as on many occasions though it did not give much sweetness to the manners of one sister was of advantage in governing those of the other 
hum iii after some opposition 
variance yielded to her sister s entreaties and consented to go out with her and mrs beginnings one morning for half an hour 
she expressly conditioned however for paying no visits 
and would do no more than accompany them to grass in sackville-street where editor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother 
when they stopped at the door mrs beginnings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call 
and as she had no business at gray s 
it was resolved that while her young friends transplanted theirs she should pay her visit and return for them 
so sense and sensibility 
on ascending the stairs the miss woods find so many people before them in the room that there was not i person at liberty to attend to their order 
and they were obliged to wait 
all that could be done to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession 
one gentleman only was standing there and it is probable that editor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch 
but the compactness of his eye and the m delicacy of his taste proved to be beyond his politeness 
he was giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself and till its size that and ornaments were determined 
all of which a tear examining and debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop were really arranged by his own invective fancy 
he had no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies than what was comprised in dim or four very broad stares 
a kind of notice which served to print on eleanor the remembrance of a person and face of strong natural sterling insignificance though adorned in the rest after of fashion 
marriage was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment on this impertinent examination of their features and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick-cases resented to his inspection remaining unconscious of it all 
for she was as we able to collect her thoughts within herself and be as ignorant of what was passing around her in mr gray shy as in her own bed-room 
t last the fair was decided 
the very the old and the pearls all received their appointment an 
the gentleman having named the last day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of the toothpick-case drew on his gloves with leisurely care and bestowing another glance on the miss dispense and sensible 
so woods but such a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration walked of with an happy air of real conceit and affected indifference 
liquor lost no time in bringing her business forward and was on the point of concluding it when another gentleman presented himself at her side 
she turned her eyes towards his face and found him with some sue rise to be her brother 
heir affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make 3 vex creditable appearance in mr gray shop 
john as was really far from being sorry to see his sisters again 
it rather gave them i action 
and his inquiries after their mother were isle and attentive 
nor found that he and fanny had been in town two days 
i wished very much to call upon you yesterday a mind he a but it was impossible for we were obliged to take harry to see the wild beam at exeter exchange and we spent the rest of the day with mrs fears 
harry was vastly pleased 
thus morning i had fully intended to call on you if i could possibly and a spare half-hour but one has always so much to do on light coming to town 
i am come here to speak farm a seal 
but to 
morrow i think i shall certainly be a e to call in berkeley-string and be introduced to your friend mrs beginnings 
i demand she is a woman of very good fortune 
and the middletons too you must introduce me to 1810 
as my mother-in-law relations i shall be happy to show them every respect 
they are excellent neighbours to you in the county i understand a excellent indeed 
their attention to our comfort their friendliness in every particular is more than i can express 
i am extremely glad to hear it upon my word 
3 5 sense and sensibility 
extend glad indeed 
but so it oughttobe 
they repent of hrgefmmdieymnlatedwmand every civility and accommodatiogethxt can serve to make your situation learnt might reasonably expected 
and so you are most comfortably settled his your life cottage and want for nothing 
edward brought us a most charming account of the place 
the most complete thing of in kind he said that ever was and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond anything 
it was a great satisfaction to us to hear it i assure our 
liquor did feel a little ashamed of her brother 
and was not sorry to be red the necessity of answering him by the arrival of us jennings’s servant who am so tell her that his mistress waited for them it the door 
mr dashed attended them down stairs wm introduced to mrs beginnings at the door of her carriage and repeating his hope of being able to call on them the next day look leave 
his visit was duly paid 
he came with a pretence at an a long from their sister-in-law for not coming too 
a us she was to much engaged with her mother that really the had no leisure for going anywhere mrs beginnings however assured him directly that she should not stand upon ceremony for the were all cousin or something like it an she should d certainly wait on mrs john daahwood very soon and bring her sisters to see her 
his manners to in though calm were perfectly kind 
to mrs beginnings most attentive civil 
and on colonel brandon’s coming in soon after himself he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say that he only wanted to know him to be rich to be equally civil to him 
after staying with them half an hour he asked eleanor to walk with him to conduit-street and introduce him to sir john and lady middle 
the weather was sense and sensibility 
s. remarkably line and she readily commented 
as soon as were out of the house his inquiries began 
a who is colonel grandson 
is he a man of fortune g a 
yes 
he has a v wood rose in donetshire.” i am glad of incline gentlemanlike man and i think eleanor i may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life a me brother 
what do you mean i a he likes you 
i observed him arrow and am convinced of it 
what is the amount of his tone in 
i believe about two thousand 3-year.” a two thousand years 
a heathen working himself up to e pitch of enthusiast generosity he added a minor i wish with all my hurt it were nice as much for our sake 
and i believe you a lie eleanor 1 but i am very sure that colonel branch has not the smallest with of marrying rule 
a you are mistaken eleanor 
you are very much mistaken 
a very little trouble on your side secures him 
perhaps just at resent he may be undecided 
the smallness of your liirtunc may make him long back 
his friends may all advise him against it 
but some of those little attendant and encouragement which ladies can no easily give will ix him in spite of himself 
and there no reason why you should not try for him 
it is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side 
in short you know as to an nmrchmem of that kind it is quite out of the question the objections are insurmountable have too much sense not to see all that 
colonel grandson must be the man 
and no civility shall be wanting an my part to make him pleased with you and your family 
it ii a match that me give universal satisfaction 
11 short it is a kind of thing that 
— lowering his voice to an important whisper 
ye sun and sausrnrurv 
a will be exceedingly welcome to all parties recollecting himself however he added that if i mean to lay 
your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled fanny particularly for she has your interest very much at heart assure you 
and her mother too mrs fence a very good 
natured woman i am are it would give her great pleasure the aid as much the other day eleanor would not vouchsafe any answer 
a it would be something remarkable now a he continued a something droll if fanny should have a brother and i a sister settling at the same time 
and yet it is not we unlikely a world edward forward a said eleanor with resolution a going to be married 
a it is not actually settled but there in such a thing in agitation 
he has a most excellent mother 
mrs forms with the utmost lilx-rnlity will come forward and settle on him a thousand years if the match takes place 
the lady is the honourable miss meryton only daughter of the late lord meryton with thirty thousand pounds 
a very desirable connexion on both sides and i have not a doubt of its taking place in time 
a thousand years is a great deal for a mother to give away to make over for ever 
but mr error has a noble writ 
to give you another instance of her liberality 
be other day as soon as we came to town aware that money could not he very plenty with us just now the put banknotes into fanny's hands to the amount of two hundred pounds 
and extremely acceptable it is for we must live at a great expense while we are here he paused for her assent and companion 
and the forced herself to say 
a your expence both in town and country must certainly be considerable but your income is a large one a not so large i dare say as many people suppose 
sense and sensibility 
ye i do not mean to complain however 
it is undoubtedly a comfortable one and i hope will in time he better 
the enclosure of scotland common now carrying on is a most serious drain 
and then i have made a little purchase within this half-year 
am kingston farm on must remember the place where old been used to live 
the land was so very desirable for me in every rest t i immediately adjoining my own property that i felt it my duty to buy it 
i could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands 
a mud must pay for his convenience and it but coat me a vast deal of money a more than you think it really and intrineically worth 
why i hope not that 
i might have sold it again the next day for more than i gave but with regard to the purchawmoney i might have been very unfortunate indeed 
for the stock were at that time so low that if i had not happened to have the necessary sum in m banker hand i must have sold out to very great loss 
a minor could only smile 
mother great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to scotland 
our respected father an you well know bequeathed all the still effects that remained at ireland and very valuable they were to your mother 
far be it for me to repose at his doing so

she seems a most valuable woman indeed 
her house her style of living all bespeak an exceeding good income and it it an acquaintance that has not a d been of great use to you hitherto but in the end may prove materially advantageous 
her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour 
and indeed it speaks altogether so great a regard for you that in all probability when the dies you will not be forgotten 
she must have a real deal to leave nothing at a i should rather suppose 
for the had only her jointure which will descend to her children a but it in not to be imagined that shelves up to her income

a her daughters are both exceedingly well married and therefore i can not perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther 
whereas in my opinion by her taking so much notice of you and treating you in this kind of way she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration which a conscientious woman would not regard 
nothing can be kinder than her behaviour 
and she can hardly do all this without being aware of the expectations she raises 
a but she raises none in those most concerned 
indeed brother your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries on too far 1 i ye to be sure a said he seeming to recollect himself people have little have very little in their power 
but my dear eleanor what is the matter with variance 
— she looks very unwell has lost her colour and is grown quite thin 
is she ill 
a a she is not well she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks i am sorry for that 
at her time of life anything of an illness destroys the bloom for ever 
hers has been a very short one 
she was as handsome s girl lad september as any i ever saw and as likely to attract the men 
there was something in her style of beauty a to please them particularly 
i remember fanny upset my that she would marry sooner and better than you did 
not but what she is exceedingly fond of you 
but so it happened to strike her 
she will be mistaken however 
i question whether variance now will marry a man worth more than ever or six hundred years at the utmost and time very much deceived if you do not do better

having fanny and myself among the earlier and best pleased of your vinitorl.” eleanor tried vex seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood 
of her marrying colonel grandson 
but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished and he was really resolved on seeing an intimacy with that gentleman and promoting the marriage by every blue attention 
he had compunction enough lad having done nothing for his sisters himself to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal 
and an offer from colonel branch or a legacy from man leaning wait the easiest mean of storing for his own neglect 
they were lucky enough to and lady middle at home and sir john came in before their visit ended 
abundance of civilities paused on all sides 
sir john was manly to like anybody and though mr dublin did not occur to know much about horses he noon set him down as a very good-natured fellow

and man leaning too an exceeding well-behaved woman though not so elegant act her daughter 
your finger need not have any scruple even of visiting her which to say the truth has been a little the cave and very naturally 
for we only knew that man leaning wan the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way 
and fanny and my fed were both strongly prepoueoaed that she nor her daughters were such kind of women an fanny would like to associate with

editor wanted very much to know though she did not hate to ask whether edward was then in town 
but nothing would have induced fanny voluntarily to mention his name before her till able to tell her that his with miss portion was resolved on or till her husband's expectations on colonel band were entered 
because she believed them still so very much attached to each other that they could not be too sedulously divided in word and deed on ever occasion

editor was pleased that he had called and still more pleased that the had mind him 
the danhwooda were in prodigiously delighted with the middletons that though not much in the habit of giving anything they determined to give them a dinner and won after their acquaintance began invited them to dine in harley-street where they had taken a very good book for three months 
their sisters and mrs join a were invited likewise and john wood wan care to secure colonel grandson who always glad to be where the mine dashwooda were 
received his eager civilities with some surprise but much more pleasure 
they were to met mr terror 
but liquor could not learn whether her tone were to be of the party 
the expectation of seeing over however was enough to make her interested in the engagement 
for though the could now meet edward s mother without that strong anxiety which had once dprornioed to attend such an introduction though the cool now see her with perfect indifference an to her junior of herself her desire of being in tom 
party with a terror her curiosity to know what the wan like was a lively an ever 
the interfere with which she thus anticipated the party was soon uftew/arda increased more fully than pleasantly by her hearing that the m steal 
were also to be at it sense and sensibility 
be so well had they recommended themselves to lady middle so agreeable had their neliduitiee made them to her that though lucy wan certainly not elegant and her sister not even genteel she was an ready sir john to ask them to spend a week or two in conduit-amen and it happened to be rtieularl convenient the main stables at soon as the as a invitation known that their visit should begin a few days before the party took place 
their claims to the notice of my john wood an the niece of the gentleman who for many year had had the care of her brother might not have done much however towards procuring them come at her table 
but as lady middleton’s guests they must be welcome 
and buck who had long wanted to be really known to the family to have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to lease them had seldom been ha her in her life than he was on receiving mrs john ashwood’e card

and to see him forftllie first time after that poured in the cow yes m as i 
she hardly knew how she could bear plan my these apprehensions perhaps were not founded entirely on reason and certainly not at all on truth 
they were relieved however not her own recollection but by the goodwill of lucy who believed herself to be inserting a severe disappointment when he told her that edward certainly would not be in harley-street on inured end even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther ye minding her that he will kept away by that extreme a action for herself which he wild not conceal when they were together

— eleanor could have given her inuuedinte relief by exerting the possibility of its being milton mother rather than her own whom they were about to behold 
but instead of doing that she secured her and with great sincerity that she did pity her 
to the utter amazement of lucy who though really uncomfortable bent hoped at lean to be an object of inepreuiblc envy to minor 
mrs terror was a line thin woman upright even to formality in her figure and serious even to journal in her aspect 
her complexion was allow and her features small without beauty and naturally without expressions but a lucky completion of the brow had reached her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity by giving it the strong characters of pink and ill-nature 
she was not a woman of many words 
for unlike people in general the proportioned them to the number of her idea and of the few syllables that did couple her not one fell toshe share of mine daahwood whom the eyed with the spirited determination of dividing her at all events

he can d not but smile to see the seriousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person

while she herself who had comparatively no power to wound them sat pointedly slighted is both 
but while she smiled at a graciousness so misapply died she could not reflect on the weak-spirited folly from which it spur nor observe the studied attentions with which the less stables courted its con tinunnce without thoroughly despising them all four 
lucy was all exultation on being so honourably distinguished 
and miss steal wanted only to be tempted about dr. davis e s to be perfectly happy 
the dinner was a grand one the servants were numerous and everything bespoke the mistress inclination for shew and the masters nobility to support it

liquor wan much more hurt by marines warmth than the had been by what reduced it 
but colonel brandon’s eyes as they were fixed on marriage declared that he noticed only what wan amiable in it 
the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister slighted on the fallen into 
v p0ivfarinnne’e feelings did not stop here 
the cold insolence of mrs female general behaviour to her litter seemed to her to foretell such dill'icultiee and distressed to minor as her own wounded heart taught her to think of with horror 
and urged by a strong impulse of affectionate sensibility she moved after a moment to her sister s chair and putting one am round her neck and one check close to here laid in a low but eat her voice a dear dear eleanor don't mind them

in a few minutes however marriage was recovered enough to at an end to the haste and sit down among the rest

poor variance 
a said her brother to colonel random in a low voice as noon as he could secure his attention 1 she has not such good health as her sister 
he is very nervous 
he had not elinor’e constitution 
and one must allow that there in something very trying to a young woman who bar been a beauty in the loss of her mental attractions 
you would not think it perhaps up variance truth remarkably handsome a few months ago 
quite as handsome a minor 
now you see it is all one chapter 1785 
lords curiosity to see mrs terror was satisfied 
she had found in her everything that could tend to make a farther connexion between the families undesirable 
she had seen enough of her pride her meanness and her determined prejudice again here to comprehend all the picnic ties that invent have replied the engagement 
and regarded the marriage of edward and herself had he been otherwise free 
and he had seen almost enough to be thankful for her own sake that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of my ferrarl’ creation preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice or by me and smsmu'rv 
any solicitude for her good or at lean if die did not bring herself quite to rejoice in edward buying letter to lucy the determined that had lucy been more amiable the ugly to love rejoiced

for a from mrs paler won after she arrived carried running away 
a my dear friend a cried lucy up soon as they were 
themselves 
i come to talk to on of my nephew 
would anything be so uttering an errand way of treating me yesterday 
so exceedingly affable up the way i you know how i dreaded the thought of seeing her 
but the very moment i was introduced there wan much an inability in her behaviour an really should it to ray she and quite look a fancy to me

editor wished to talk of something else but lucy sense and sensibility 
is still pressed her to own that the had reason for her happiness and finer wan obliged to go on 
undoubtedly if they had known your engagement a said the soothing cox d be more flattering than their treatment of you 
but as that we 
not the clue 
a i pursued you would say no a lie la quickly 
but there wan no reason in the work d why a terrace could seem to like me if she did no 
and her liking me in thing 
you that ask me out of my satisfaction 
am sure it will all end well and there will be no difficulties at all to what i used to think 
my ferraril a charming woman and so in your sister 
they are both delightful women indeed 
... i wonder i who never hear you say how agreeable mrs dashed was up a to this liquor had no answer to make and did not after t any 
are you ill mix wood 
— you seem low 
you don't speak 
— sure you and well 
a a i never wan in better health 
i am glad of it with all my heart but really you did not look it 
i should be so so to have you ll 
— you that have been the greatest come on to me in the world 
— heaven known what i should have done without your friendship 
liquor tried to make a civil unfelt though doubling her own succeed 
but it returned to satisfy lucy for the directly replied 
indeed i am ieerﬁmly convinced of your regard for me and next to own i love it in the great comfort i have 
poor edward 
but now there in one good thing 
we shall be able to meet and meet hetty often for lady middle he delighted with my e wood 2 we shall be a good deal in harley-meet i due a and edward spend half his time with his sister 
does lady middle and mrs terror will of sons and snusrmu-rv 
visit now 
and mrs errand your sister were both so good to say more than once they should always be glad to see me 
— that are such charming women 1 
i am sure if ever you tell your sister what i think of her you can not speak too high but liquor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she low 
tell her sister 
lucy continued i am sure should have seen it in a moment if mrs fear had took a dislike to me 
if she had only made me a formal curtsey for instance without saying a word and never after had took any notice of me and never looked at me in a pleasant way 
you know what i am 
if i had been treated in that forbidding sort of way i should have gave it all up in d dr 
i could not have stood it 
for where she do i liked i know it in most violent editor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph by the door s being thrown open the servants announcing mr fears and towards immediate walking in 
a it was a very awkward moment 
and the countenance of each showed that it was so 
they all looked exceedingly foolish 
and edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again as to advance farther into it 
the very circumstance in its unpleasantness form which they would each have been most anxious to avoid had fallen on them 
they were not only all three together but were together without the relief of any other person 
the ladies recovered themselves 1st 
it was not lucy business to put herself forward and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up 
she could therefore only loo 
her tenderness and after slightly addressing him said no more 
but liquor had more to do 
and so anxious was she for his sake and her own to do it well that the forced herself after a moment s recollection to welcome him sense and sensibility 
my with a look and manner that were almost easy and almost a 
and another struggle another effort still improve them 
she would not allow the presence of lucy nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself to deter her from saying that she was ye to see him and that she had very much regretted 1 g from home when he called before in berkeley-meet 
she would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which as a friend and almost a relation were his due by the observant eyes of lucy though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her 
her manners gave some assurance to edward and he led courage enough to sit down 
but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion which the case rendered reasonable though his sex might make it rare 
for his heart had not the indifference of lucy s nor could his conscience have quite the ease of eleanor's 
lucy with a demure and settled air seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the other and would not say a word 
and almost everything that war said proceeded from editor who was led to volunteer clothe information about her brothers that their coming to town c. which edward ought to have inquired about but never did 
her exertions did not no here 
for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroic disposed as to determine under pretence of fetching marines to leave the others by themselves 
and she really did it and but in the handsomest manner for she loitered away several minutes a on the landing place with the most right-minded fortitude before she went to her finger 
when that was once done however it was time for the raptures of edward to cease 
for marines to hurried her into the drawn from immediately

but i have much to say to you on that had which can not be laid now

a but why were you not there edward 2 
why did you not come 
a i was engaged elsewhere 
a engaged i 
but what was that when such friends were to be met 
a perhaps miss variance cried lucy eager to take some revenge on her a you think young men never and upon engagements if they have no mind to keep them little at well an great eleanor went very angry but marines seemed entirely insemibic of the sting 
for the calmly pulled a not to indeed 
for seriously speaking i am very cure that conscience only kept edward from harleymeet 
and i really believe he la the most delicate conscience in the work d

a my dear edward thin must not be

said variance on her leaving them

how teazing to edward 
a a why no i 
we were all his within and lucy had been the longest known to him of any

variance looked at her steadily and aid you know eleanor that this is a kind of talking which i can not bear 
if on only hope to have your assertion contradicted an must suppose to he the case you ought to recollect that i am the last person in the world to do it 
i can not descend to be tricked out of sunrancet that are not really wanted she then left the room 
and finer dared not follow her to my more for bound as the wall by her promise of secrecy to such she could give no information that would convince variance 
and painful an the consequences of her still continuing in an error might be the was obliged to submit to it 
all that the could hope was that edward would not often expose her or himself to the dim of hearing marianne’l mistaken warmth nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended their recent meeting 
and this she had every reason to expect

lady middle wan ashamed of doing nothing before them and the flattery which lucy wan maid to think of and administered at other times the end they would despise her for ordering 
mine stable was the least discomposed of the three by their pretence 
and it was in their power to reconcile her to it entirely 
would either of them only have given her a full and minute account of the whole affair between marriage and mr willoughhy the would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best place he the here after dinner which their arrival occasioned 
but thin conciliating wan not granted 
for though the often threw out expressions of pity for her title to editor and more than once dry bed a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before one no feet we produced but a look of indifference from the former or of disgust in the latter 
an effort even yet lighter might have made her their friend 
would they only have laughed at her about the doctor 
but to little were they any more than the other inclined to oblige her that if sir john dined from home the might spend a whole day without hearing any other misery on the subject than what she was kind enough to blew on herself 
all these jealous and discontent however were to totally unsuspected by man leaning that he thought it a delightful thing for the girls to be together 
and gentlemen congratulated her young friends every night on having escaped the company of a no it old woman to long 
she joined them sometimes at sir john s and sometimes at her own house 
but wherever it wan the agony came in excellent spirits full of delight and immense and sensibility 
31 romance attributing charlotte well-doing to her own care and ready to give so exact so minute a detail of her situation as only maria steal had curiosity enough to desire 
one thin m disturb her 
and of that she made her daily camp in 
mr paler maintained the common but unfairly opinion among his sex of all infant heir alike 
and though she could plainly perceive at die rent times the most striking resemblance between this baby and every one of his relations on both sides there was no convincing his father of it 
no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like me by other baby of the same age 
nor could he even brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of in being the nest child in the world 
i come now to the relation of a misfortune which about this time befell mrs john dashed 
it so happened that while her two sisters with mrs evenings were 1st calling on her in harley-street 
another of her acquaintance had dropped in 
a circumstance in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her 
but while the imaginations a other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct and to decide on it by slight appearances once happiness must in some measure be always at the more of chance 
in the present instance this last-arrived abdy allowed her fancy so far to outrun truth and probability that on merely hearing the name of the miss dashwoods and a understanding them to be mr wood s sisters she immediately concluded them to be staying in early street 
on this misconstrued produced within 3 dusk or two afterwards cards of invitation for them as we as for their brother and sister to a small musical party at her house 
the consequence of which was that mrs john dashed was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly real inconvenience of sending her carriage for the less dashwoods but what was still 1814 sense and sensibility 
wont must be object to all the unpleasantness of up ring to treat them with attention and who could i that the might not expect to go out with her a second time the power of disappointing them it was true must always be here 
but that was not my 
for when people are determined on a mode of con act which they know to be wrong they feel injured by the e reception of anything better from them 
romance had now been brought by degrees to much into the habit of going out every day that it we 
become a matter of indolence to her whether she went or not and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every evening s engagement though without expecting the smallest amusement from any and very often without knowing till the last moment where it wan to take her 
to her dress and appearance she was growing so perfectly indiﬁ'urcnt on not to bestow half the consideration on it during the whole of her toilette which it received from miss steal in the first live minute of their being together when it was finished 
nothing escaped laura minute observation and general curiosity 
she saw everything and asked everything 
was never away till she knew the price of every art of marianne’l dress 
could have guessed the name m of her gowns altogether with better judgment than variance herself and was not without hope of finding out before they parted how much her washing cost per week and how much the had every year to spend upon lrcraclf 
the impertinence of these kind of scrutiny moreover was generally concluded with a compliment which though meant an it doer was considered by marriage up the greatest impertinence of all 
for after undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown the colour of her shoes and the arrangement of her hair the was almost sure of being told that upon a her word she looked vastly smart and she dared to say would make a gets many conquest sense and sensible 
3 with such encouragement as this was she dismissed on the present occasion to her brothers carriage 
which they were ready to enter vex minutes after it stopped at the door a punctuality not very agreeable to their sister-in-law who had preceded them to the house of her acquaintance and was there hoping for some delay on their part that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman 
the am of the evening were not very remarkable 
the party like other musical parties comprehended a great many people who had real taste for the performance and a great many more who had none at nail 
and the performers themselves were 
as usual in their own estimation and that of their immediate friends the first private performers in england 
as editor was neither musical nor affecting to he so she made no scruple of turning away her eyes from the grand pianoforte whenever it suite her and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp and a violence would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the room 
in one of these exquisite glances she perceived among the group of young men the very he who had given them a lecture on toothpick-cases at gray 
she perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself and speaking familiarly to her brother 
and had determined to find out his name from the latter when they both came towards her and mr dashed introduced him to her as mr robert fender 
he addressed her with easy civility and twisted his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done that he was exact the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by lucy 
happy had it been for her if her regard for edward had depended less on his own merit than on the merit of his nerves relations 
for then his brother s bow must have given the fishing stroke to what ill-humour of his mother -5 sense nun sensrnru-rv 
and finer would have begun 
but while the wondered at the difference of the two young men the did not and that the emptiness and conceit of the one put her at all out of charity with the modesty and worth of the other 
why they were different robert explained to her himself in the mob of a quarter of an hour conversation 
for talking of his 
brother and lamenting the extreme gaucberic which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper gaiety he candidly and generally attributed it much ll ll to any natural deficiency than to the misfortune of a private education 
while he himself though probably without any particular any material superior my nature merely from the advantage of a. public echo wan an well attend to mix in the world as any other man 
a upon my soul 1 he added a i believe it is nothing more and so i often tell my mother when he in grieving about it 
my dear madam 1 i always any to her you must make yourself easy 
the evil in now irrenrcdiablc and it has been entirely your own doing 
why would you be persuaded by my uncle sir robert against your own judgment to place edward under private station at the most critical time of his life 
if on her only sent him to westminster at well at myself instead of sending him to mr pratt all this would have been prevented this ll the way in which i always consider the matter and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error 
liquor would not oppose his opinion became whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage of a public school she could not think of edward abode in mr pratt s family with any action 
a you read in ﬂevonshire i think was till next observation in a cottage near dawlish.” eleanor set him right as to its situation and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody could live in sense and sensmu'rv 
3 devonehire without living near dawdle 
he bestowed 1 hearty approbation however on their of use 
a for my own part a said he i am excessively fond of a cottage 
there it always to much comfort so much elegance about them 
and i detest 
if i had any money to a ere i should buy a lie e land and build one myself wig a a short dinner of london where i might drive myself down at any time and collect a few friend about me and be happy 
i advise everybody who is going to build to build cottage 
my friend lord courted came to me the other city on purpose to sink in advice and laid before three different plan of noise 
i was to decide on the beat of them 
a my dear courted a said i immediately throwing them all into the fire do not do either of them but b all means build a cottage end that i fancy will the end of it 
a some people imagine that there can be no accommodation no e in a cottage 
but this in all a mistake 
i warm month at my friend elliot's near hereford 
lady elliot visit to give a dance 
a but how can it be done 
a laid the 
a my dear peruse do tell me how it it to he managed 
there ll not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple and where can the an be 2 1 i immediately thaw chatter could he no city in it so i said my dear lady elliot do not be uneasy 
the divine parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease 
card-table i may be placed in the drawing-room 
the library may be of for tea and other refreshment 
and let the upper set out in the saloon lady elliot wan delighted with the thought 
we entered the dining-room and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple and the affair war are changed precisely after my plan 
so that in fact you lee if people do but know how to set about it every 8 sun and seusruru'rv 
comfort may be at well enjoyed in a coming as in the most spacious dwelling 
liquor agreed to it all for she did not think he deserved the cow linen of rational supposition as john day wood had no more pleasure in public than hit eldest litter his mind was equally at liberty to ix on anything else 
and a thought struck him during the evening which he communicated to his wife for her approbation when they got home 
the consideration of mrs dennison’s mistake in supposing his linen their guests had suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become touch while mrs jenniugt s an engagement kept her from home 
the expense would be nothing the inconvenience not more 
and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy of his conscience inlaid out to be requisite to its complete enfranchnement from his promise to hit father 
fanny wan startled at the proposal 
a i do not see how it can be done a said she a without aﬁi'onting lady middle for they spend every day with her 
otherwise i should be exceedingly glad to do it 
you know i am always ready to pay them any attention in my power as my taking them out this evening them 
but they are lady middleton’s visitor 
how can i ask them away from her 
her husband but with great humility did not see the force of her objection 
they had already spent a week in this manner in conduit-street and lady middle could not be displeased at their giving the name number of days to such near relations 
fancy paused a moment and then with fresh vigour us -5 1 my love i would ask them with all my heart if it was in my power 
but i had just settled within myself to in the miss stables to spend a few days with us 
they are very well-behaved good kind of girls 
and i sense and sensxnm'rv 
3 think the attention is due to them as their uncle did so very well by edward 
we can ask your sisters some other year you know 
but the miss steal may not being townand more 
am sure will like them 
indeed you like them you know very much already and so does my mother 
and they are such favourites with harry 
mr dashed was convinced saw the accused of inviting the miss steal immediately and his conscience was practised by the resolution of inviting his linen another year 
at the same time however slyly suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless bringing eleanor to town as colonel brandon's wife and me a mere visitor 
farm ye can in her escape and mud of the red wit thatyhad poured it were thepuext morning to 
lucy to not her company and her sisters for some days in bar street as soon so lady middle could spare them 
this was enough to make lucy really and reasonably happy 
mrs dashed seemed actually working for her herself cherishing all her hopes and promoting all her views 
such an opportunity of being with edward and his family was above all things the most material to her interest and such an invitation the most gratifying to her feelings 
it was an advantage that could not he too graceful acknowledged nor too speedily made use of 
and the visit to lady middle which had not before had any precise limits was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two a time 
hen the note was shown to minor us it was within ten minutes after its arrival it gave her for the list time 
some share in the expectations of lucy 
for such a mark of uncommon kindness touched on so short an acquaintance seemed to declare that the goodwill towards her arose from something more than merely to sense and sbnsibiutv 
malice against henelﬁmd nightbebmghghytime mdaddmmdoeverythingzhatlu wished

sir john who on them more than once brought home such account the favour they were in a must he universally striking 
my daahwood had never been to much pleased with any young women in her life an the wet with them 5 had given each of them a needlework made by some emigrant

chili 
ﬁii'ﬂll 14 paper was to well at the end fortnight that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her 
and continuing herself with visiting her once or twice a day returned from that period to her own lawns and her own habits in which she found the main daahwoodl very ready to resume their former share 
about the third or fourth morning after their being that re-entered in berkeley-street 11 leaning on returning from her ordinary visit to my partner entered the drawing-room where editor was sitting by herself with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful 
and giving her time only to form that idea began directly to justify it by laying waymxwuuam 
me sense and sensibility 9 lord 
my dear miss wood 
have you heard the news up 
no ma'am 
what is it i a a something so strange 
but on shall hear it all 
when i got to mr papers i end charlotte quite in a fuss about the child 
she was sure it was vile ill 
it cried and fretted and was all over trim as 
t i looked at it directly and a lord 
my dear says i a it is nothing in the world but the medium 
2 and nurse said upset the same 
but charlotte she would not be said end so mr naval was sent for 
and luckily he happened to be just come in from harley-street so he stepped over directly and as soon as ever he saw the c d he said just as we did that it was nothing in the world but the medium and then charlotte was easy 
and so just as he was going away again it came into my head i am sure i do not know how i happened to think of it but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news 
no upon that he remarked and simpered and looked grave and seemed to know something or other and at last he said in a whisper a for fear any unpleasant report should reach the mud ladies under your ears m to their sisters disposition i think it advisable to say that i believe there is no great mean for alarm 
i hope mrs dashed will do very well 
what is fanny ill 3rd that is exactly what i said my dear 
a lord says i a mrs dashed ill 
a so then it all angel out 
and the long and the short of the matter by all i can lent seems to be this 
mr edward february the very young man i used to joke with you about but however as it turns out i am monstrous glad there never was anything in it mr edward farmer it seems has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin lucy 
— there s for you my dear i 
and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter except fancy 
— 9 sense and sensibility 
could you have believed such a thing possible g 
there is no great wonder in their liking one another 
but that matter 
should be brought so forward between them and nobody suspect it 
that is strange 
— i never be led to see them together or i am sure i should have no it out directly 
well and to this was kept a great secret for fear of mrs f errant 
and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter 
till this very morning poor fancy who you know is a well-meaning creature but no conjugal t it all out 
a lord 
a thinks she to herself they are 1 so fond of lucy to be sure they will make no difficulty about it 
2 and so away she went to your sister who was sitting all alone at her carpet-work little suspecting what was to come 
for she had just been saying to your brother on over minutes before that she thought to make a hate between edward and some lord s daughter or other i forget who 
so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride 
she fell into violent hysterics immediately with such scream as reached your brothers ears as he was sitting in his own dressing-room downstairs thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country 
so up he drew directly and a terrible scene took lace for lucy was come to them by that time little rearing what was going on 
poor soul 
i pity laura 
and i must we think she was used very hardly 
for your sister scolded like any fury and won drove her into a fainting fit 
fancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly 
and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know what to do 
mrs dashed declared that should not stay a minute longer in the house and your mother was forced to go down upon bill knees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes 
tom she fell into hysterics again and he was so frightened that he would send for mr naval and mr naval found the sense and sensibility 
3 house in all this uproar 
the carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away and they were stepping in as he came of 
poor lucy in such a condition he says she could hardly walk 
and fancy she was almost as bad 
i declare i have no patience with your sister 
and i hope with all my heart it will be a match in spite of her 
lord 
what a kind poor mr edward will be in when he hears of it 
t have his love used so scornfully for they say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may 
i should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest of passion 
and mr naval thinks just the same 
he and i had a great deal of talk about it 
and the best of all is that he is gone back again to harley-street that he may be within call when mrs errors is told of it for she was sent for as soon as ever m cousins left the house for your sister was sure as wo d be in hysterical too 
and so she may for what i care 
i have no pity for either of them 
i have no notion of people making such a told about money and greatness 
there is no reason on earth why mr reward and lucy should not marry 
for i am cure mrs terror may afford to do very well her son 
and though lucy has next to nothing herself she knows better than anybody how in make the most of everything 
and i dare say if mrs form would only allow him over hundred years she would make as good an a patience with it as anybody else would with eight 
lord how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours 
or a little goer 
with two maid and two men 
andibelievei couldhelpthemtoa housemaid for my beauty has a sister out of place that would it them exactly here my bearings ceased and as liquor had had time enough to collect her thoughts she was able to give such an answer and make such observations as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce 
— them to go sense and serslbllm 
and that the was not hide of any extraordinary interesting it 
that on mine an all had flame often might be the case cared no heart ached edward 
and happy above allude rut in the absence of marriage she felt very well able to break of the air without embarrass and to give herjudgmcnt an the believed

she could hardly determine rather an expectation of its event really was

and still more anxious to know how edward would conduct minnelli

she felt much compassion 
— for lucy vex little 
and it coat her name pains to rock that lit egg 
for the rest of the party none at t 
as mr joining could talk on no other subject eleanor noon saw the necessity of preparing arrange for in discussion 
— no time war to be lost in undeserving her in making her acquainted with the real truly in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by when without betraying that she felt any uneasiness her sister or any resentment against edward 
lilinor’l office was a painful own 
she wan going to remove what the really believed to be her sister s chief consolation 
room give inch particular of edward as the feared would ruin him after ever in her good and to make variance by a remembrance in their situation which to fancy would ocean strong feel all her own disappointment over again 
but unwelcome in such a tack man be it was necessary to be done and finer therefore hastened to perform it 
showery farfromwiahing dwell our own sense and sensibility 
of feelings or to represent herself as suffering much any otherwisethan as the self 
command she had practised since her first knowledge of edward s en a meat i hit suggest a hint of what was practicable to arrange 
or narration was clear and simple 
and though it could not be given without emotion it was not accompanied violent agitation nor in get 
the 
belonged rather to the hearers for prince listened with horror and cried excessively 
editor was to be the comfort of others in her own times no less than in theirs 
and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind and a very earnest vindication of edward from every charge but of irnpnulence was reading offered 
but arrange for some time would vex credit to neither 
edward seemed a second will by 
and acknowledging as eleanor did that she bad loved him most sincerely could she feel less than herself i as for luck steal she considered her so totally unnminble so also lately incapable of attaching s sensible man that she could not be persuaded at first to believe and afterwards to pardon any former affection of edward for her 
she would not even admit it to have been natural 
and finer left her to be convinced that it was so by that which only could convince her a. better knowledge of mankind 
her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement and the length of use it had existed 
marines feelings had then broken in and put an end to all regularity of detail 
and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress lessen her alarms and combat her resentment 
the first question on her side which led to farther particulars was 
— 
how long has this been known to you linger 
has he written to you 3 6 sums and sensible 
i have known it the four month 
when lucy that came to barton-park last november the told me in confidence of her engagement 
at these words arianne’l eyes express the astonishment which her i could not utter 
after a pane of wonder the exact aimed 
— a four months i 
have you known of this mr month 2 
— liquor confirmed it 
what i 
while sending me in all my misery 
he thin been on your heart 2 and i have reached you for being happy 
— a thou not at that you should then know how much i was the reverse 
a four months 
cried variance again 
a so calm 
to cheerful i how have you been supported 
a a by feeling that i was doing my duty 
my mind to lucy obliged me to be secret 
i owed it to therefore to avoid giving any hint of the truth 
and i owed it to my family and friends not to create in them a solitude about me which it could not he in my power to satisfy 
variance seemed much struck 
a i have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother a added eleanor 
2 and once or twice i have attempted it 
— 
but without betraying my must i never could have convinced you a four months 
— and yet you loved him if eyes 
but i did not love only hire 
— and while the comfort of others was dear to me i wan glad to spare them from knowing how much i felt 
now i can think and speak of it with little emotion 
i would not have you suffer on my account 
for i assure you i no longer asunder materially myself 
i have many thing to support me 
i am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any importance of my own and sense and sensibility 
by i have home it as much as possible without spreading it farther 
i acquit edward of all essential misconduct 
i wish him very happy 
and i am so sure of his always doing his duty that though now he may harbour some regret in the end he mum become so 
lucy does not want sense and that is the foundation on which every 
-thingaﬁood m be built 
and after all variance after that is taking in the idea of a single and constant attachment and all that can be said of one happiness depending entirely on any‘pam'cular person it is not meant 
it is not fit 
it is not possible that it should be so 
edward will marry lucy 
he will marry a woman superior in reason and understanding to half her sex 
and done an habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to 12 
a if such is your way of thinking a said variance if thelossofwhatismostvaluedis so easily be made up he something else our resolution your self-command are perhaps a little less to be wondered at 
they are brought more within my comprehension i understand you 
you do not so that i have ever felt much 
for four months ran i have had all this than go on my mind without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature 
knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you t unable to prepare you for it in the least 
it was to 
me 
it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself whose prior engagement mind all prospects 
and told me as i thought with triumph 
his person suspicions therefore i have had to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most deeply interested 
and it has not been only once 
i have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again 
i have known myself to be divided from edward for ever without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire ll 
6 8 sense nun sensibility 
the connexion 
nothing hat proved him forth 
nor huanythingdeeluedhimrndilferentwme 
have had to contend against the unkindness of bitter end the insolence of bid mother and have entered the punishment of an attachment without enjoying iv advantage 
and all this has been going on at a time when no you too well know it has not been my only if you can think me capable of ever feel ye you may suppose that i have suffered now 
he do of mind with which i have brought myself at present to consider the matter the consolation that i have been v willing to admit have been the effect of couch and painful exertion g 
they did not spring up of tluerruelvee 1 they did not occur to relieve m spirit at losing 
no variance 
that if i had not been bound to silence perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely 
not even what owed to my scarce friends 
from openly showing that i wait my unhappy marriage was quite subdued 
a oh 
liquor 1 she cried a you have made me hate myself for ever 
how barbarous have i been to you 
— you who have been my only comfort who have borne with me in all my misery who have seemed be only suffering for me i 
in thin my gratitude 
a thin the only return i can make you 
became your merit cried out upon myself i have been trying to do it army 
the tenderest career followed this confession 
in inch 3 frame of mind abode was now in liquor had no difficult in obtaining from her whatever profile she required 3 and at her request variance engaged never to peak of the affair to any one with the lean appear dance of bitterness 
— to meet lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her 
— and even to ice edward himself if chance should bring them together without any diminution of her usual cordiality 
theme were great confession but where variance felt that the sense and senshihjty 
ye had injured no separation could be too much for her to make 
she performed her promise of being discreet admiration 
shutter to all that man leaning had to say upon the subject with an unchanging complexion dissent from her in nothing and was heard three times to say yes ma'am she listened to her pride of lucy with only moving from one chair to another and when mrs beginnings talked of edward affection it cost her only a pair in her throat such advances towards heroism in her time made eleanor feel equal to anything herself 
the next morning brought a farther trial of it in a visit from their brother who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful affair and bring them new of his wife 
i a i a you have heard suppose a said he with solemnity as soon as he was seated of thesvleury‘ shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday 
they all looked their went 
it seemed too awful a moment for speech 
a your sister 1 he continued a had suffered dreadfully 
mr errands too 
in short it his been a scene of such complicate distress 
but i will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome 
poor fanny 
she was in hysterics all merry 
but i would not alarm you too much 
man says there is nothing materially to be apprehended 
her constitution in a good one and her resolution equal to anything 
she has home it all with the fortitude of an angel 
she says she never shall think well of anybody again 
and one can not wonder at it after being so deceived 1 
evening with each ingratitude where so much kindness had been shown so much conscience had been placed 
it was quite out of 20 sense and sbnsibili‘i‘v 
the benevolence of her heart that she had urged there young women to her house 
merely became she thought they deserved some attention were harmless well-behaved girls and would be pleasant companions 
for otherwise we both wished very much to cure invited you and marriage to he with or while your kind friend there we attending her daughter 
and not be no 1 rewarded 
i with with all my heart a lie poor fancy in her affectionate way 2 that had indeed your sister instead of then a here he stopped to be thanked 
which being done he went on 
that poor mrs terror sufferer when am fanny wrote it to her in not to be described 
while the with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connexion for him was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person i 
such a suspicion could never have entered her head i if the sun led an reputation where it could not be in ii quarter 4 the to he are a laid the i might have thought myself safety she war quite in en ago 
we consulted together however as to what you d be done and at last the determined to lend for edward 
he came 
but i am sorry to relate what ensued 
all that mrs terrace could by to make him put an end to the engagement assisted too at you may well suppose 
by my argument and fancy entreaties was of no avail 
duty nﬂ‘eetion everything war disregarded 
i never thought edward to stubborn so unfeeling before 
his mother explained to him her liberal designs in case of his marrying nice meryton 
told him the would settle on him the norfolk grate which clear of land-tax bring in a good thousand years 
opened even when matter grew deeper to make twelve hundred 
and in opposition to this if he still persisted in thin low connexion represented to him sense and sensible 
to 
the certain penury that must attend the match 
his own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all 
she would never see him again 5 and so far would she be from according him the smallest assistance that if he were enter into any profession with a view of better support she would do all in her power to prevent his advancing in it here arrange in an ecstasy of indignation wrapped her hands together and cried a gracious go an this be possible a a well may you wonder variance replied her brother 1 at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these 
your exclamation is very natural 
marriage was going to retort but she remembered her promises and forbore 
all this however he continued a was urged in vain 
edward said very little 
but what he did say was in the most determined manner 
nothing could prevail on him to give up his engagement 
he would stand to it coat him what it might a then cried mrs beginnings with blunt sincerity no longer able to be silent a he has acted like an honest man 
i beg your pardon mr dashed but if he had done otherwise i should have thought him a casual 
i have some little concern in the business as well as yourself for lucy steal is my cousin and i believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world nor one who more deserves a good husband 
john dashed was greatly astonished 
but his nature was calm not open to provocation and he never wished to offend and especially anybody of good fortune 
he therefore reap end without any resentment 
a a i would by no means a it disrespectfully of any relation of yours madam 
m lucy steal ii i dare say a very deserving young woman but in the present case you know the connexion must be impossible 
and its sense and sensibility 
have entered iritouecretengagemtwith lying a man under her uncle care the iron of a woman cordially of such very large fortune on my fear perhaps altogether a little extraordinary 
in short i do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of m whom you have a regard for my bearings 
e all wish her extreme happy and my ferrars’a conduct throughout the whole has been such an every conscientious good mother in like circumstance would adopt it had been dignified and liberal 
edward has drawn his own lot and i fear it will be i bad one variance sighed out her similar a reception 
and eleanor's heart wrong for the feelings of edward while breaking his mother threats or a woman who could not reward him 
a well sir a laid mr leaning and how did it end 2 1 i am sorry to my ma'am in a most unhappy rupture 
edward is dismissed for ever from his mother s 4 
notice 
he left her home yesterday but where he is one or whether he is still in town i do not know 
or we of course can make no inquiry 
a poor young man 
and what is to become of him in a what indeed ma'am 
it it a melancholy consideration 
born to the prospect of such nﬂiuencel i can not conceive a situation more deplorable 
the interest of two thousand pounds 
how can a man live on it 
— and when to that is added the recollection that he might hunt for his own folly within three months have been in receipt of two thousand vex hundred years for miss meryton has thirty thousand pounds i can not picture to myself a more wretched condition 
we must all feel for him 
and the more no because it is totally out of our power to artist him a poor young man i 
cried my lending a i am sure he should he very welcome to bed and board at my sense and sensibility 
3 house 
and i would tell him if could see him 
it it not at that he should be living about at his own charge now at lodging and taken 
eleanor's heart thanked her for such kindness towards edward though he could not forbear smiling at the form of it 
a if he would only have done at well by himself a laid john wood us all his friends were disposed do him might now have been in hit rope situation and would have wanted for nothing 
but i it it it must be out of anybody power to aunt him 
and there ll one thing more rearing against him which man be worse than all in mother had determined with a very natural kind of spirit to cattle that estate a robert immediately which might have been edwardiani on proper condition 
1 left her this morning with her lawyer talking over the business 
4 well i a raised my bearings 
that is bar revenge 
a mood he a way of their own 
but i don't think warning would be to make one son independent become another had plagued me variance got up and walked about the room 
can anything be more calling to the spirit of a man a continued john than to see all under brother in possession of an estate which might t have been his own 
poor reward i feel for him sincerely 
a few minute 
more spent in the lame kind of definition concluded his visit 
and with repeated auunneee on his litterthat he really believed there wan no material danger in fancy indisposition and that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it he went away 
leaving the three ladies unanimity in their sentiment on the present occasion at far at least as it regarded my female conduct 
the dashwooda’ and towards 
marinnne’t indignation burst forth as noon at he 14 sense and sensibility 
quittcdthe room 
and uhervehemeneemade reserve impossible in editor and unneoemry in man leaning 
they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party 
charm new 
as evenings we very warm in her price of edward conduct but only editor and marriage understood it true merit 
7th only knew how little he had had to tempt him m be disobedience and how small war the consolation beyond the coneciouaneta of doing right that could remain to him in the more of friends and fortune 
liquor gloried in his integrity 
and marriage forgave all his offences in companion for his punishment 
but though confidence between them am by this public discovery letter to its proper ate it was not a subjects on which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone 
liquor avoid it upon principle an tending to ix still more upon her though by the too warm too positive endurance of 7 marriage that belief of edward i continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away 
and marianne'a courage soon failed her in trying to converse upon a topic which always left her more diautieﬁed with herself than ever by the compel-icon it necessarily produced between elinor‘e conduct and her own 
she felt all the force of that comparison 
but not at her sister had hoped to urge her to exertion now 
the felt it with all the pain of continual self-reproach regretted most bitterly that the had never exerted himself before 
but it brought only the torture of penitence without the hope of amendment 
her mind wan so much weakened that the still fancied present exercise and sensibility 
15 noon impossible and therefore it only dispirited her more 
nothing new was heard by them for s d or two afterwards of affairs in harley-meet or ardent buildings 
but though so much of the matter was known to them already that mrs beginnings might have had enough to do in reading that knowledge farther without seeking after more she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousin as soon as she could 
and nothing but the hindrance of more vision than usual had prevented her going to them within that time 
the third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars was so one so beautiful a sunday as to draw many to ensign ton gardens though it was only the second week in arch 
mrs leaning and finer were of the number 
but variance who knew that the willoughbys were again in town and had a constant dread of meeting them chose rather to stay at home than venture into no public a place 
an intimate acquaintance of mrs beginnings oiled them soon after they entered the gardens and finer was not so 
i that by her continuing with them and edgar in all is jennings’s conversation she was herself left to quiet rejection 
she saw nothing of the willoughhys nothing of edward and for some time nothing of anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay be interesting to her 
but at last she found herself with some surprise accosted by miss steal who though looking rather shy expressed great satisfaction in meeting them and on receiving encourage e meat from the particular kindness of mrs turnings ere her own party for a short time to join theirs 
mrs beginnings immediately whispered to amor 
“getitallout of her my dear 
she will tell anything you ask 
you seen can not leave mrs darker 1806 sense and sensibility 
it wan lucky however for mr jenninge’l curiosity scud elinor’l too that the would tell anything without being asked for nothing would otherwise have been learnt 
i am to god w need you a said mill smell taking her familiarly by the arm a for i wanted to ice you of all things in the world 
and then lowering her voice a i suppose mrs beginnings has heard all about it 
it she angry 
a a not at all i believe with you 
2 that in a good thing 
and lady middle in is angry 
i can not suppose it be that she should 
a i am monstrous glad of it 
goodgﬂcioulld have had such a time of it 
i never saw lock in such a rage in my life 
she vowed at first the world never trim me up a new bonnet nor do anything else for me again i long as she lived 
but now she is quite come to and we are as good friend an ever 
look she made me this bow to my hat and put in the feather last night 
there now you are going to laugh at me too 
but why should not i wear pink ribbon 
i do not care if it i the doctor favourite colour 
i am sure for my part i should never have known he did like it better than any other colour if he had not happened to say 
so 
my cousins have been no plaguing me 
i declare eometirnel 
i do not know which way to look before them 
she had wandered away to a subject on which liquor had nothing to my and therefore noon judged it expedient to and her way back again to the first 
a well but miss dashed speaking turn faintly people may say what they chose about mr errant declaring he would not have lucy for it be no such a thing i can tell you 
and it i quite a shame for such ill-natured reports to be read abroad 
whatever lucy might think about it herself you know it was no business of other people to set it down for certain 
sense and sensxbili‘i'v 
on a i never heard anything of the kind hinted at before i assure on said eleanor 
oh did not you 
but it war said i know very well and by more than one 
for miss goodly told miss spars that nobody in their senses could expect mr fears to give up a woman like miss meryton with thirty thousand pen to her fortune by lucy style that had nothing at all 
and i had it from miss spars myself 
and besides that my cousin richard laid himself that when it came to the point he was afraid mr terrors would be off 
and when edward did not come near meal for three days i could not tell what to think myself 
and i believe in my heart lucy gave it all up for lost 
for we came away from your brother's w ecstasy and we saw nothing of him not all thursday friday and nature and did not know what was become with him 
once lucy the hat to write to him but then her spirit rose against that 
however this morning he came just as we came home from church 
and then it all came out how he had been sent for wednesday to harley-street and been talked to by his mother and all of them and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but lucy and nobody but lucy’would he have 
and how he had been so worried by what passed that as soon as he had went away from his mother s house he had got upon 1 his horse and rid into the country somewhere or other 
and how he had staid about at an inn all thursday and friday on purpose to get the better of it 
and after thinking it all over and over again he said it seemed to him as if now he had no fortune and no nothing at all it would be quite unkind to s her on to the engagement because it must be for her on for he had nothing but two thousand pounds and no hope of anything else 
and if he was to go into orders as he had some thoughts he could get nothing but a curacy and how was they 1803 sense and sensibility 
to live upon that 
— he could not bear to think of her doing no better and so he begged if the had the least mind or it to at an end to the matter directly and leave him to she for himself 
i heard him say all thin as plain as could possibly be 
and it was entirely for mr sake and upon bar account that he laid a word about being off and not in no his own 
i will take my oath he never dropt a style able of being tired of her or of wishing to marry miss moon or anything like it 
but to be sure lucy would not have ear to such kind of talking 
so she told him direct my with a great deal about sweet and love you know and all that 
oh in 
one can repeat such kind of things you know 
— she told him directly the had not the least mind in the world to be off for she could live with him upon such a trifle and how little over he might have she should be very glad to have it all you know or something of the kind 
so then he was monstrous ha pay and key on some time about what the shall do and they agreed he should take orders directly and they must wait to be married till he got a living 
and not then i could not hear any more for my cousin ca red from below to tell me mrs richardson was come in her coach and would take one of us to huntingdon gardens 
so i was forced to go into the room and intend them to ask lucy if she would like to go but she did not care to leave toward 
to i just run pain and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the richardson 1 i do not understand what you mean by interrupting them said eleanor 
a you were all in the same room together were not you i 
a no indeed 
not us 
la 
miss dashed do you think people make love when anybody else is by 
oh 
for shame 
— to be sure you must know better than that 
laughing affectedly 
— no no 
they were sense and sensibility 
1800 shut up in the drawing-room together and all i heard was only by listening at the door a how i a cried eleanor 
a have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door 
i am only did not know it before 
for i certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself 
how could you behave so unfairly by your sister 
a job la 
there is nothing in its 
i only stood at the door and heard what could 
and am sure lucy would have done upset the same by me 
for a year or two back when arthur sha and i had on many secrets together she never man any bones of hiding in s closet 
or behind i chimney-board on to hear what we saw a line tried to talk of something else 
but miss steal could not be kept beyond a couple of minute 
from what was uppermost in her mind 
a edward talks of going to oxford soon a said she a but now he is lodging at no 
— 
all all 
what an ill-natured woman his mother is a n't she and your brother and sister were not very kind however i shrank say anything against them to you and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot which was more than i looked for 
and for my part i was all in fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswife she had gave us a day or two before 
but however nothing was said about them and i took care to keep mine out of sight 
edward have got some buns 
nuts at oxford he says so he must go there for a time and after that as soon as he arm light upon a bishop he will be ordained 
i wonder what curacy he will get 1 
good gracious 
begging as she spoke i d lay my life i know what in cousins will say when they hear of it 
they will tell me i should write to the hot sense and sensibility 
doctor to get edward the cure of his new living 
i know they will 
but i am cure would not do inch 8 thing for all the world 
— lad shall any directly 1 i wonder how you could think of such a thing 
i write uniiuthedoctor indeed 
-5 a well a said eleanor 
it is a comfort to be prepsar‘ed’agninst the worn 
you have got your answer it ye 
miss stable was going to reply on the same subject but the approach of her own party made another more necessary 
oh la 
here come the richardson 
i had a vast deal more to say to you but i must not stay away from them not an longer 
i assure you they are very genteel people 
e makes a monstrous deal of money 2 and they keep their own coach 
i have not time to work to mrs beginnings about it myself but pray tell her am quite happy to hear she in not in anger against us and lady middle the same 
and if nothing should happen to take you and your sister away and mrs ending could want company i am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes 
i suppose lady middle wo n't ask iii any more thin but 
good-bye 
i am sorry miss marriage was not here 
remember me kindly to her 
la 
if you have not got your best spotted muslin only 
i wonder you was not afraid fit being turned such was her parting concern 
for after thin the had time only to pay her farewell come silently to mrs beginnings before her company was led by mrs ran and editor was left in possession of knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time though she had learnt v little more than what had been already foreseen andellhre-planned in her own mind 
towards marriage with lucy was i firmly determined on and the time of its taking place remained sense and sensibility 
i t i as absolutely uncertain as she had concluded it would be 
— everything depended exactly after her expectation on his stating that preferment of which at present there seem not the smallest chance 
as soon as they remained to the carriage mrs joining was eager for information 
but a editor wished to read as little as possible intelligence that had in the best place been so unfairly chained she concerned herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars as she felt assured that lucy for the sake of her own consequence would hate to have known 
the continuance of their engagement and the means that were to be taken for provoking its end was all her communication 
and this preach from mrs joining the following natural remark 
wait for his having a living i 
ay we all know how that will end 
— 
the will wait a twelvemonth and ending no good comes of it will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds year with the interest of his two thousand pounds and what little matter mr stale and mr pratt can give her 
— then they will have a child every year and lord help hem how poor they will be 
i must see what i can give them towards furnishing their house 
two maids and two men indeed i 
as i talked of other day -5 no no they must get a. stout girl of all worked 
yes sister would never do for than new 
the next morning brought eleanor a letter by the penny post from lucy herself 
it was as follows 
bunc-rr’s barnes manly 
i hope my dear miss wood will excuse the liberty take of writing her but i know your friendship ormewillmake you pleatedwhearsuchs account of myself and my dear edward alter the trouble we have went through lately therefore will make i i 
sense and sensibility 
no more apologies but proceed to say that thank god 
though have suffered dreadfully we are both quite well now and as happy as we must always be in one andrews love 
we have had great trials and great persecutions but however at the same time gratefully acknowledge many friends yourself not the least among them whose great kindness i shall always thankfully remember as will edward too who i have rid of it 
i am sure you will be glad to hear as likewise dears beginnings spent two happy flirts with him yesterday afternoon he would not hear of our parting though earnestly did i as i thought my duty required urge him to it for prudence sake and would have parted for 
ever on the spot would he consent to it 
but he said it should never be he did not regard his mother s anger while he could have my affections 
our prospects are not very bright to be sure but we must wait and for the best 
he will be ordained shortly and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to anybody that has a living to bestow am verdure you will not forget us and dear mrs beginnings too trust the will break a good word for us to sir john or mr paler or any friend that may be able to assist us 
poor anne was much to blame for what she did but she did it for the best so i my nothing 
hope mrs beginnings don't think it too much trouble to give us a call should she come this way any morning would be a great kindness and my cousins would be proud to know hen 
my paper remind me to conceal e and begging to be most gratefully and respectful remembered to her and to sir john and lady middle and the dear children when you chance to see them and love to miss marriage i am 30 31 
as soon as liquor had finished it she performed what the concluded to be its waters real design by sense and sensibility 
3 placing it in the handle of mrjenninge who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and pride 
a very well indeed i 
how pretty the write 1 
eye that was quite proof 5 to let him be off if he would 
that at like no 
— poor soul i with i could et him a living with all my beam 
she calls me deep in evenings you lee 
she is a good-hearted girl at ever lived 
very well won my word 
that sentence iaveryprettilytumed 
egyengillgonndeeeher sure enough how attentive she in to think of everybody 
an 
you my dear for showing it me 
it in m pretty 5 letter at ever i saw and does lucy head and heart great credit 
chains meat 
he in duhwoode had now been rather more than two months in town and marines in silence to be one increased every day 
she sighed m the air the ll try the quiet of the country 
and fancied that if apace could give her eye baron must do it 
editor was hardly lean anxious than herself for their removal and of my so much leaf bent on in being effected immediately at that the was conscious of the ‘ﬂicnltiet of so long a journey which variance could not be brought to acknowledge 
she began however seriously to turn her thoughts toward it accord vehement and had already mentioned their without their kind hotels who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good-will when a plan wan suggested which though detaining them from home yet i few weeks longer 
poured w eleanor altogether much more eligible than any other 
the painters were to remove to livedand about the end of march for the ear ii

— 
try it was enforced with so much real politeness by mr paler himself an joined to the very great amendment of hit manners towards them since her inner had been known to be unhappy induced her to accept it with pleasure 
when the told variance what the had done however her first reply was not very suspicious 
a livedand 
a 
she cried with great agitation 
a no i can not go to cleveland.” 1 you forget 1 aid eleanor gently that its duration in not 
that it is not in the neighbourhood of

— i not go into somerccuhirc 
— l‘hcrt, when i looked forward to going 
no eleanor you can not expect me to go there eleanor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming inch feelings 
— the only endeavoured to connect them by working on other 
— and represented it therefore an a measure which would ix the time of her referring to that dear mother whom the to much wished to see in a more eligible more comfortable manner than any other plan could do and perhaps without any greater delay 
me livedand which was within a few mile of bristol the distance to pardon was not beyond one day though a long day's journey 
and their other servant might can come there to attend them down 
and an there cox d be no occasion for their dying above a week at livedand they might now he at home in little more than three weeks time 
a marianne’r affection for her mother was sincere it fun triumph with little difficulty over the imaginary evil the had started 
spies and snusmu’rv 
15 mrs beginnings was so far from being weary of her guests that she passed them vary earnestly to return with her again in livedand 
liquor m grateful for the attention but it could not alter their design 
and their mothers concurrence being rail everything relax veil to their return was omen as far as it could be 
— and marriage found some red of in drawing a a statement of the hours that were yet in divide her form baron 
a ah colonel i do not know what you and i shall do without the miss dashwoods 1 
was mrs beginnings s address to him when he first called on her after their leaving her was settled 
— a for they are quite resolved upon my home from the papers 
— and how forlorn we shall be when i come back i 
lord 
we shall sit and peep at one another as dull as two cents 
perhaps as beginnings was in hopes by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui to provoke him to make that offer which might give himself an escape from it 
and if so she had soon afterwards good reason to drink her object gained 
for on eleanor's moving to the window to make more ox obviously the dimensions of a right which she was going to coax ye for her friend he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning and conversed with her there for several minutes 
the effect of this discourse on the lady too could not escape her observation 
for though the w too honourable to listen and had even changed her seat on purpose that she i hit not hear to one close by the pianoforte on which dinner was playing she could not key herself from seeing that eleanor changed colour latter end with agitation and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment 
still farther in confirmation of her in the interval of marines turning from one lesson to another some words of the colonel inevitably reached her ear in which he seemed to be apologising 6 skins and sensibility 
for the hardness of his house 
this let the matter beyond a doubt 
she wondered indeed at his thinking it necessary to do no 
— but supposed it to be the paper etiquette 
what eleanor said in reply the cow d not diuingniah but just red from the motion of her lip 
that the did not think i i any material objection 
— and mrs beginnings commended her heart never 5 being so honest 
they then talked on for few minutes longer without her catching a syllable when another lucky top in marianne’a performance brought her these words in the colonel m voice 
a i am afraid it can not take place very soon 
astonished and shocked at so unlover-like of speech she was almost ready to cry out a lord 
what should hide it 
— but checking her desire concerned herself to thin silent ejaculation 
v 1 this ll very strange i 
in he need not wait to be older this delay on the colonel side however did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least 
for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards and moving different ways man leaning very plainly heard editor say and in a voice which showed her to feel what she said i shall always think myself very much obliged to one ye mrs beginnings was delighted with her solitude and on 
wondered that after hearing such a sentence the cow one should be able to take leave of them as he immediately did with the utmost sang-froid and go without making her any reply 1 
she had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suit 
what had really paused between them was to this elect 
a t have heard said he with great companion 1 of the injustice your friend mr fears has suffered from sense and sensibility 1 7 his family 3 for if i understand the matter right he has been entirely cast off by them for persevere in his engagement with a very deserving young woman 
— have i been rightly informed 
— 
is it so 
liquor told him that it was 
2 the cruelty the impolitic cruelty he replied with great feeling 
of dividing or attempting to divide two ago pop e long ached to each other is terrible 
fear does not know what she may be doing 
what she may drive her son to 
i have seen mr terrors two or three times in harley-street and am much pleased with him 
he is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in s short time but i have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake and as a friend of yours i wish it still more 
i understand that he intends to take orders 
will you be so good as to tell him that the living of holford now just vacant as i am informed by this day post is his if he think it worth his acceptance 
— 
but dimly perhaps so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now it may be nonsense to appear to doubt 
i only wish it were more valuable 
— 
it is a rectory but a small one 
the late incumbent i believe did not make more than 20 ends per annum and though it is certainly capable of improvement i fear not to such an amount as to for him a very comfortable income 
such as it is however my lesson in presence him to it will be very great 
ray assure him of it linor’s.asmnlshment at this commission could hardly have been greater had the colonel been really making her an offer of his hand 
the preferment which only two day s before she had considered as hopeless for edward was already provided to enable him to many 
— and the of all people in theory was fixed on to know it 
her emotion was such as mrs beginnings had attributed to a very different cause g 
but whatever 18 sense and sensibility 
minor feelings less pure less pleasing might have a share in that emotion her esteem for the general benevolence and her gratitude for the clear friendship which together prompted colonel grandson to this act were strongly cell and warmly expressed 
she thanked him for it with all her hem spoke of edward principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure if it were really his wish to put on no agreeable on alice to no ear 
but at the same time she could not help than that no one could so well perform it at himself 
t was an office in short from which unwilling to give edward the pain of receiving an oblivion from her the would have been very glad to be spared herself 
— but colonel grandson on motives of equal delicacy declining it likewise still seemed so desirous of its age given through her means that she would not on any account make farther a position 
edward she believed was still in town an fortunately she had heard his address from miss steal 
she could undertake therefore to inform him of it in the course of the day 
after this had been settled colonel grandson began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour 
and thus it was that he mentioned with regret that the house was small and indifferent 
— an evil which eleanor as mrs beginnings had supposed her to do made very light of at least as far as regarded its size 
the smallness of the house said the 4 i can not imagine my inconvenience to them for it will be in fro motion to their family and income 
my which the colonel was surprised to and that be we considering their mania e an the certain consequence of the recantation 
or he did not suppose it possible that lord living could supply such an yawns 
and snusrnxu-rv 
19 income as and in their style of life would aversion to settle on 
and e did so 
this little rectory can do no more than make mr terror comfortable is a bachelor 
it can not enable him to marry 
i am sorry to my that my patronage end with thin 
and my interest is hardly more extended vex 
if however by any foreseen chance it should be in my power to serve him further i must think very differently of him from what now do if lain not ready useful to him then sincerely wish i could beat present 
what i urn now doing indeed come nothing at ill since it can advance him no little toward what must be hit principal his only object of hasp 
new 
his marriage mourn still be a direct good 
— at east i am afraid it can not take place we soon such was the sentence which when misunderstood so just offended the delicate feeling of me leaning 
but after this narration of what really passed between colonel branch and finer while they road at the window the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting may perhaps appear in general not let reasonably excited nor less properly worded than if it and driven from an offer of marriage 
charm it 
a 
all in due 
did me leaning ungraciously unfolding as loan as the glen man had withdrawn i do not ask you what the colonel ha 
been trying to you 
for though upon my honour i tried keep out of hearing i could not help catching enough to understand his business 
and i more you i never wan better 20 sense and sensibility 
placed in my life and i will you joy of it with all my heart a thank you ma'am aid eleanor 
a it i i matter of great joy to me 
and i feel the goodness of colonel grandson coat sensibly 
there are not many men who would act as he has done 
few people have to compose a heart 
i never was more astonished in my life lord 
my dear you are we modest 
i on the lean astonished at it in the work d for i have often thought of late 
there was nothing more likely to happen 
a you judged from your knowledge of the colonel general benevolence 
but at lean you could not foresee that the opposite would so we noon occur 1 importunity 
a repeated as sending 
2 the 
as to at when a man ha 
once made up his mind in week a thing oonxchow or other he will soon and an opportunity 
well my dear i with you joy of it again and again 
and if ever there war a happy couple in the world i think i shall won know where to look for them 
a you mean on go to hereford after them i suppose said eleanor with a faint inside 
aye my dear that i do indeed 
and up to the house being a bad one i do not know what the colonel would be at for it in as good a one as ever i saw a he he often being out of art welland whose fault is that 
why do n't he repair it up 
who should do it but himself 
a they were interrupted by the servants coming in to announce the carriage being at the door 
and man leaning immediate preparing to go laid 
well my dear must be gone before i have had half my talk out 
but however we may have it all sense and sensibility 
12 
over in the evening for we shall be quite alone 
i do not why you to go with me for i dare lay your mind in too full of the matter to care for company 
and beside you must long to tell your sister all about it begmarianne had left the room before the conversation an 
a certainly madam i shall tell variance of it 
but i shall not mention it at present to anybody else 1 oh i very well mind me leaning rather disappointed 
a then you would not have me tell it lucy for i think of going as far at bottom 00-day.” know madam not even lucy if you please 
one day delay will not he vex material 
and till i have written to mr fear i think it ought not to be mentioned to anybody else 
i shall do be directly 
it of income that no time should be lost with him for he will of count have much to do relative to his ordination this each at lit puzzled mr. joining exceedingly 
my mr terror was to be written to about it in such a hurry she could not immediately tom reached 
a few moments rejection however produce a very a happier and the exclaimed 
a b hole condemn you 
mr errors is to be the man 
well so much the better for him 
a to before he man be ordained in readiness 
and am .verygladm and things are so forward between you 
but my dear in not thin rather out of character 
should not the colonel write'himeelf 
sure he in the m n. light dint quite understand the beginning of my jenninge’l speech 
neither did he think it worth inquiring into 
and therefore only replied to in confusion 
a colonel grandson is cox delicate a man that he rather wished any one to announce his intention to mr f error than himself 22 sees 
and sensibility 
and so you are forced to do it 
well boy is an odd kind of delicacy 
however i will not disturb our stir her ring to write 
you know an concerns 13 good-bye my dear 
i of 
not heard of anything to please me so well since charlotte was brought to bed 
and away she went but returning again in a moment 
a i have been thinking of letters sister my dear 
should be very glad to get her so good a mistress 
but whether she would do for a lady maid i am sure i can tell 
she is an excellent housemaid and works very well at her needle 
however you will think of all that at your leisure 
certainly madam 1 replied eleanor not hearing much of what she said and more anxious to he alone than to he mistress of the subject how she should begin 
how she should express herself in her note to edward was now all her concern 
the particular circumstances between them made a dislike my of that which to any other person would have been the easiest thing in the world 
but she equally feared to say too much or too little and t deliberating over her paper with the m in her hand till broken in on the entrance of e ward himself 
e had met me leaning s at the door in her way to the carriage us he came to cave his farewell cured 
and the after apologising for not returning herself had obliged him to enter m saying that in dashed was above and wan to speak with him on very particular business 
liquor had just been congratulating herself in the midst of her perplexity that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth when her visitor entered to force her upon this greatest sense and sensibility 
2 exertion of all 
her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance 
she had not seen him before since his engagement became public and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted with it 
which with the consciousness of 
what she had been thinking of and what she had to tell him made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes 
he too was much distressed and they sat down together in a most promising state of embarrassment 
whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming into the room he could not recollect 
but determining to he on the safe side he made his 1 fogs in form us soon as he could say anything other in g a chair 
a mrs beginnings told me a said he 2 that you wished to speak with me at least i understood her so 
or i certainly should not have introduced on you in such a manner 
though at the some time i should have been extremely sorry to leave london without seeing you and your sister 
especially as it will most likely be some time 
it is not probable that i should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again 
i go to oxford tomorrow 
a you would not have gone however said eleanor recovering herself and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible 1 without received in our good wishes even if we had not been able to give them in person 
mrs beginnings was quite right in what she said 
i have something of consequence to inform you of which i was on the point of communicating by paper 
i am charged with a most agreeable office breathing rather faster than usual on she spoke 
colonel grandson who was here only ten minutes ago has desired me to say that understanding you mean to take orders he has great pleasure in offering you the living of demand now must vacant and only wishes it were more valuable 
a w me to condemn you on 24 sense and sensibility 
having no respectable and well-judging a friend and to join in his with that the living 
it up about two hundred years 
were much more considerable and such as might better enable you w 
a might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself 
much in short a might establish ill your views of happiness 
what edward felt no he could not any it himself it can not be expected that any one else could lay it for him 
he noted all the astonishment which such unexpected which such unthought inforrnan'on could not fail of exciting 
but he said only these two words 
a colonel random 
a a year a continued eleanor gathering more revolution 
a tone of the worst was over 
colonel grandson mean it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately for the cruel situation in which the unjust c conduct of your family has placed you 
a concern which i am cure variance myself and ill your friend 
must share 
and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general chamber and his part are approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion 
colonel grandson give me a living 
— can it he 
the unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to and friendship anywhere 1 no 1 replied he with in ten consciousness not to and it in you for i can not be ignorant that to you to your goodness i owe it all 
i feel it 
would expect it if i could 
but as you well know i am no orator.” 1 you are very much mistaken 
i do nature you that you owe it entirely at least almost entirely to your own merit and colour brandon’s discontent of it 
i have had no hand in it 
i did not even know till i understood his design that the living was vacant 
nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have inch 3 living in sense and servility 
as his as a friend office ofmyfsrnil heavy lamps 
indeed i know he but still greater up ensure in throwing it 
but upon my word you owe nothing to my solicitation 
truth obliged her to acknowledge some mull share in the action 
but she was it the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefach’ess of edward that she acknowledged it with hesitation 
which probably contributed to ix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it 
for a short time he sat deep in thought after liquor had ceased to speak 
at last as if it were rather an effort he said 
a colonel grandson seems a man of great worth and nobility 
i have always heard him spoken of as me and your brother i know esteems him highly 
he is undoubtedly a sensible man and in his manners perfectly the gentleman 
a indeed a replied eleanor 1 i believe that you will find him on farther acquaintance all that you have heard him to be 
and a will be suchverynear neighbours for i understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion-house it is particular ye important that he should be all this edward made no answer 
but when she had turned away her head gave her a look so serious so earnest so cheerful as seemed to say that he might hereafter with the distance between the parsonage the mansion-house much greater 
a colonel pardon i think lodges in st james'sstreet a said he soon afterwards rising from his chair 
liquor told him the number of the house 
i must hurry away then to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give you 
assure him first he has made me a very 
an exceedingly happy man 
liquor did not offer to detain him 
and they parted 26 sons and snusxan-v 
withsveryeamestassuraneeon beside heroes 
in 
good wishes for his happiness in everything of situation that might befall him 
on in with rather an attempt to return the me good-will than the power of expressing it 
a when i see him again said eleanor to herself is the door shut him out i shall see him the husband of lucy 
and with this pleasant anticipation she sat down to consider the the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of edward 
and of course to reflect on her own with discontent 
when mrs beginnings came home though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before and of whom therefore she must have a gust deal to say her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession than by anything else that she reverted to it again as soon as eleanor appeared 
well my dear 1 she cried i sent up up the young man 
did not i do right -5 
an i suppose you had no great difficulty 
— you did not lend him very unwilling to accept your proposal 2 1 no alarm 
that was not very likely swell and how soon will he be ready i 
for it seems all to depend upon that a 
really i eleanor i know so little of these kind of forms 
that i can hardly even conjecture as to the time or the preparation necessary 
but i suppose two or three months will complete his ordimtion.’ a two or three months 
a cried my bearings 
a lord 
my dear how calmly you talk of it and can the colonel wait two or three months 
lord bless me 
— i am sure it would at me quite out of patience 
— and though one would very glad to do a kindness by poor mr f ran i do think it is not word while to wait two or three months for him 
sure somebody sense and sensibility 
v 27 else might be found that would do a well 
somebody that is in order as ye 
a my dear madam a said eleanor what can you be this of i 
why colonel brandon’s only object is to be use to mr terror 
a lord bless you my dear l. sure you do not mean to persuade me that the colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to mr fears 4 the deception could not continue after this 
and an explanation immediately took place by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment without an material loss of ha witness to either for mrs beginnings exchanged one arm of delight for another and without forgetting her expectation of the list 
aye aye the age is but allall one said she after the first am 
of surprise and satisfaction was over and very likely may be out of repair 
but to hat a man a lodging as i thought for house that to my know ye has ever sitting-room on the groundlloor and i think the house 5 told me could make fifteen beds 
and to you to that had been used to live in wanton cottage 
it decide quite ridiculous 
— but my clear we must touch up the colonel to do something to the parsonage and make it comfortable for them before lucy goes to it but colonel grandson does not seem to have any 1 ideas of the divine being enough to allow them to i 
e colonel to i nanny my dear 
because he has two thousand years himself he thinks that nobody else can many on leaf 
take my word for it that if i am alive i shall be paying a visit at holford parsonage before michaelmas 
and i am sure i shrank go if lucy not there 
e nor was quite out of her opinion no to the proofs nobility of their not waiting for anything more 
us sends us murmur 
chapter 1 
toward having arrived hit that to colonel grandson proceeded with his next to lucy 
and such war the excess of it ye the time he reached bartlen’t building 
that the was able to nature on beginnings who called on her again the next day with her congratulations that the had never seen him in such spirit before in her life 
her own happiness and her own spirit were at least very certain 
and the pointed mr joining moor heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in holford parsonage before michaelmas so far was the at the tame time from any hackwardnett to give eleanor that credit which edward would give her that the spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth was ready to own all that obligation to her and openly declared that no exertion for their good on miss dashed s it either prefer or future would ever surprise her or the believed her capable of doing anything in the world for those the really valued 
as for colonel grandson the was not only ready to worship him at a faint but was moreover thin anxious that he should be treated at one in all worldly concerns 
anxious that his tithes should be raised to the moon 
and secretly resolved to avail herself at holford as far as the post could of hit serving his carriage his cows and hit poultry 
it was now above a week since john earth had called in berkeley-street and at time that time no notice had been taken by them of his wife indisposition beyond one verbal inquire editor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit 
— his was an obligation however which not only opposed her own inclination but which had not the assistance of any encouragement sense and sensibility 
29 from her companions 
variance not contented with absolute refusing to go herself was very urgent to prevent her interest going at all 
and mrs beginnings though her carriage was always 
at eleanor's service so very much disliked my john wood that not even her curiosity to peace how she looked after the late discovery nor her strong desire to affront her by taking edward part could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again 
the consequence was that eleanor set out by herself to pay a visit for which no one could really have less inclination and to run the risk of a téteeis-téu with a woman whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike 
mr 
wood was denied 
but before the carriage could turn from the house her husband accident ye 
came out 
he expressed great pleasure in meeting eleanor told her that he had been going to all in berkeley-street and assuring her that fanny would be glad to lee her invited her to come in hey walked up stain into the drawing-room 
nobody was there 
a fanny is in her own room i suppose a said he 
— a i will go to her presently for i am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing you 
very far from it indeed 
now especially there can not be 
but however on and marriage were any great favourite 
by would not marines come 
a minor made what excuse she could for her 
a i am not sorry to ice you alone a he replied a for ihaveagooddealtosaytoyou 
thislivingof colonel brandon’hnn it be two i 
has he really given it to edward 1 
i heard it yesterday by chance and was coming to you on purpose to inquire farther about it a it in thy true 
— colonel grandson has given the living of hold to edward ii 
i 1810 sense and sensibility 
a really i 
well this is very astonishing 
— 
no relationship 1 
no connexion between them i 
end now that livings fetch such a price 1 
what was the value of this ll 1 about two hundred a 
year 
a very well 
and for the next presentation to a living of that value 
m opposing the late incumbent to have been old and sit ye and likely to vacant it soon 
he might have got i dare say 
fifteen hundred pounds 
and how came he not to have settled that matter before this person's death i 
now indeed it would be too late to sell it but a man of colonel brandon’s sense 
— i wonder he should be so improvement in a point of such common such natural concern 
— 
well i am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character 
i suppose however 
on recollection 
— that the case may probably be his 
edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the colonel has really sold the presentation is old enough to take it 
— 
e aye that is the fact depend upon it 
e nor contradicted it however very positively 
and by relating that she had herself been employed end in conveying the other from colonel grandson to ward and to he must understand the terms on which it was given obliged him to submit to her authority 
a it is truly astonishing 
— he cried after what she said 
a what could be the colonel motive 
a very simple one 
to be refuse to mr freeman 
well well 
whatever colonel grandson may be edward is a very lucky man 
you will not mention the matter to farm however 
for though i have broke it to her and she it my well she will not like to hear it much talked of 
liquor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing that the thought fanny might have home with composure an acquisition of wealth to her brother sense and sensibility 
13 
by which neither the nor her child could be poring impoveriahed 
a mrs forward a added he lowering his voice to the tone becoming so important a a know 
nothing about it at present and i believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long an my be 
— when the marriage takes place i fear she must hear of it all 
a but why should such precaution be used i 
though it is not to supposed that mrs fears can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son had money enough to live upon 
— for but must be quite out of the question 
yet who after her late behaviour is she supposed to feel at all 
he has done with her son she put him of 
for ever and has made all those over whom she had any influence cast him off likewise surely after doing on she can not be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account 
she can not be interested in anything that befall him 
she would not be an weak as to throw away the comfort of a child and retain the anxiety of a parent 
a a all minor said john your reasoning is very but it is founded on ignorance of human nature 
hen edward anna match takes place depend upon it his mother will self as much as if she had never discharged him 
and therefore every circumstance that may accurate that dreadful event 
must be concealed from her on much as possible 
mrs fear can never forget that edward in her in 
you surprise me 
i should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by ii time 
you wrong her exceedingly 
mrs fears is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world a editor was silent 
2 we think am a said mr dashed after a short paused a of robert marrying miss montoni 13 sense and sensibility 
liquor willing at the grave and deceive importance of her brothers tone calmly replied 
— 4 the lady i suppose has no choice in the affair 
chance i 
how do a mean t 1 i only mean that supposed from your manner of taking it must be the lame to mill meryton whether an marry edward or robert certainly there can be no dill'crcncc 
for robert will now to all intent and purpose be considered an the eldest son 
and an to anything else they are both very agreeable young men 
i do not know that one in superior to the other eleanor said no more and john was also for a than time silent 
his reflections ended than 
of one thing my dear sister a kindly taking her hand and taking in an awful whisper a i may assure you and will do it because i know it must gray you 
i have good reason to think 
indeed i have it from the heat authority or i should not repeat it for otherwise it would be very wrong to my anything about it 
but i have from the very heat authority 
not that i ever precisely heard mimic terror lay it himself but her daughter told and i have it from her 
that in short whatever objection 
there might be against a certain 
a certain connexion 
you understand rule 
it would have been far preferable to her it would not have her half the vexation that ill duet 
i wan exceeding pleased to hear that an f mare considered it in that light 
4 very gratifying circumstances you know to up all 
a it would have been beyond companion 1 ah aid the lean evil of the two and she would be glad to composed now for nothing women but however all that in quite out of the question 
not to be thought of or mentioned 
an to any attachment you know 
it never could he 
all that a gone by 
but i thought i would just tell you of this became i knew how much sense and sensibility 
as it must please you 
not that you have any son to regret my dear eleanor 
there is no doubt of your doing exceeding well 
quite as well or better perhaps all thin i considered 
has colonel grandson been with you la yes it nor had heard enough if not to gratify her vanity and raise her self-importance to agitate her nerves and all her mind 
and she was therefore glad to be red from the necessity of saying much in reply herself and from the danger of hearing anything more from her brother by the entrance of mr bent forward 
after a few moments hunt alone dmihwood recollecting that fanny was yet uninformed of his sister being there quitted the room in nest of her 
and editor was left to improve her acquaintance with robert who by the gay unconcern the ha pay self-complacency of his manner while enjoying so a air a division of his mother s love and liberality to the prejudice of his banished brother earned only by his own dissipated course of life and that brother integrity was concerning her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart they had scarcely been two minutes by themselves before he began to speak of edward 
for he too had heard of the living and was very inquisitive on the subject 
liquor repeated the particular of it as she had given them to john and their effect on robert though very different was not less striking than it had been on bias 
he laughed most immoderately 
the idea of edward begin a clergyman and living in a small parsonage-house diverted him beyond measure 
and when to that was added the fanciful image of edward reading years in a white surface and pushing the banks of marriage between john smith and mary brown he could conceive nothing more ridiculous 
liquor while she waited in silence and immovable gravity the conclusion of such folly could not remain 14 sense and seisibilh'v 
her eyelfrom being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited 
it war a look however very well bestowed learn it relieved her own feelingnand gave no intelligence to him 
he was recalled from wit to window not by any reproof hen but by his 
own sensibility 
we may treat it as a joke said he at lute recovering from the affected laugh which had considerable lengthened out the genuine giver of the moment 
a but up no my soul it is a most tedious business 
poor edw i he in mind for ever 
i an extreme sorry for it 
for i know him to be a very good-hearted creature 
at well meaning a fellow perhaps as any in the world 
you must not judge of him mine i wood from your alight acquaintance

his manners are certainly not the happiness in nature 
but we are not all born you know with the lame power 
the came address 
poor fellow to ice him in a circle of strangers 
m be cure it we 
pitiable enough i 
but upon my soul i believe he band on good a heart at any in the kingdom 
and i declare and protest to you i never wan no checked in my life a when it all burst forth 
i could not believe it 
m mother was the list person who told me of it and feeling myself called on to act with resolution immediately aid to her a m dear madam i do not know what on may intend to a on the occasion 
but up for myself i must ray that if edward duel marry thinning woman i never will act him against that wan what i laid immediately 
— i wan most uncommonly checked indeed i 
poor reward 
he hat done for himself completely e 
shut himself out for ever from all decent society 1

i happened to drop in for ten minutes

i remember her perfectly

i offered immediately up soon in mother related the affair to me w to him myuelfﬁnd dissuade him from the bench

t had i been informed of it a few hourearlier i think it in most probable that something might have been hit on 
i certainly should have resented it to edward a very strong light 
my ear fellow a i should have laid consider what you are doing 
you are making a most disgraceful connexion and such i one an your family are unanimity in disapproving i can not help drinking in short that means might have been found but now it is all too late 
he knelt be carved you know 
that in certain 3 absolutely mend 
he had settled this point with god 
composure when the entrance of mrs john dashed put an end to the subject 
but though as never spoke of it out of her own family eleanor could lee its influence on her mind in the something like confusion of countenance with which he entered and an attempt at cordiality in he behaviour to herself 
she even proceeded to for us to be conceived to and that editor and her under wereloloonrolenvetown ugly earth there more of them

than 13 no other short call in harley-meet in which eleanor received her brother congratulation 
on their travelling no fury towards baron without any expense and on colonel brandon’s being to follow them to clare-land in a day or two completed the intercourse of the brother and life in town 
and a faint invitation from fanny to come to scotland whenever it should happen to be in their way which of all thing war the most unlikely to occur with a more warm though lean public assurance from john to editor of the raw attitude with which he should come m in her at meal was all that foretold any meeting in the country 
it amuses her to observe that all her friend leaned determined to send her to hereford 
a place in which falls there she would now least hate to visit or wish to reside 
for not only was it considered on her nature home by her brother and man leaning but even lucy when they parted gave her a pang invitation to visit her there

for the convenience of charlotte and her child they were to be more than two day on their journey and mr paler travelling more ox variously with colonel grandson wan to join them at livedand noon after their arrival 
variance few a had been her hours of comfort in london and eager at her had long been to quit it could not 
when it came to the inn bid adieu to the house in which the had for the at time enjoyed these hopes and that confidence in willoughhy which were sense and sensibility 
if now extinguished for ever without great pain 
nor could she leave the place in which willoughby remained in new engagements and new schemes in which a could have no share 
without shedding man tears 
lords satisfaction at the moment of removal was more positive 
she had no such object for her lingering thoughts to ix on she left no mature behind from whom it would give her a moment regret to be divided for ever she was pleased to be free herself from the mention of luck friendship she was grateful for using her sister away unseen by willoughhy since his marriage and she looked forward with hope to what a few months of tranquillity at pardon i hit do towards restoring marines peace of mind concerning her own 
their journey was safely performed 
the second day brought them into the cherished or the prohibited county of somerset for as such was it dwelt on by turns in marines imagination 
and in the footman of the third they drove up to livedand 
livedand was a spacious modern-built house situated on a sloping lawn 
it had no park but the pleasure-grounds were tolerate extensive 
and like every other place of the same degree of importance it had its open shrubbery and closer hood-wink 
a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation led to the front 
the lawn was blotted over with timber 
the house itself was under the guardianship of the or the mountains and the asia and a deal screen of them altogether interfered with tall lombardy popular shut out the offices 
variance entered the house with an heart swelling with emotion from the consciousness of being only i try miles from parson and not thirty from come gun 
and before she had been ever minutes within its sense and sensibility 
its walls while the there were busily helping charlotte threw her child to the housekeeper the quitted it stealing away through he the winding ihmbberiel now just beginning to be in pity to gain a time eminence 
where from its great temple her eye wandering over a wide me of country to the south-east could fondly rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon and army that from their summit combat mood might be seen 
in such moments of precious of invaluable he rejoiced in tears of agony to be at livedand 
and as the returned by a different circuit to the house feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty of wandering from lace to place in free and luxurious solitude she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained with the pavement in the indulgence of such solitary rambles 
she returned just in time to join the other as they quitted the house on an excursion through its more immediate premises 
and the rent of the morning was easily while away in lounging round the kitchen garden examining the bloom upon its walls and listening to the gardener s lamentations upon bright 
in dawdling through the greenhouse where the loss of her favourite plants unwearying exposed and i by the lingering roof raised the laughter of chair one elms 
in visiting her poultry-yard where in the disappointed hopes of her dairymaid by hens fondling their nest or being stolen by a four or in the rapid decease of a promising young broad she found fresh sources of merriment 
the morning was one and dry and arrange in her plan of employment abroad had not calculated ear an change of weather during their stay at livedand 
the great surprise therefore did she and herself prevented by a settled rain from going out again after smart run msrnru'n 
3 dinner 
she had depended on a twilight walk to the green temple and perhaps all over the grounds and an evening merely cold or damp would not have referred her from it 
but a hen and settled rain even 17 could not fancy dry or pent weather for walking 
their way small and the hour quietly away

liquor however little concerned in it joined in their discourse and marriage who had the knack of finding her way in every house to the library however it might be avoided by the family in general soon procured herself book 
nothing was wanting on my paler ride that constant and friendly good humour could do to malt 
them feel themselves welcome 
the ones and heartless of her manner more than amazed or that want of recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the form of politeness 
her kindness recommended by so pretty a face was engaging 
her folly though evident war not disgusting because it war not'conceited 
and finer could have forgiven everything but 
her laugh 
he two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner affording a pleasant enlargement of the party and a very welcome variety to their conversation which along morning of the time continued rain had reduced very low 
liquor had reckon so little of mr calmer and in that little had been much variety in his address to herriater' and herself that she knew not what to expect to find him in in own family 
she found him however perrys sense and sensible 
exactly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitor and only occasionally made to his wife and her mother 
she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion and only relented from being so always by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people in general as he must feel himself to be to me leaning and charlotte 
for the nest of his character and habits they were marked as far as eleanor could received with no traits at all unusual in his sex an time of life 
he was nice in his eating uncertain in his hours 
fond of his child though affecting to slight it 
and died away the mornings at billiards which ought to have been devoted to business 
she liked him however a 2 the whole 
much better than she had expected an in her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more 
not sorry to be driven b the observation of his epicurism his selfishness an his conceit to rest with complacency on the remembrance of edward generous temper simple taste and diffident feelings

and who treating her at once as the interest friend of mr terror and the kind confidante of himself talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at holford described its deficiencies and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them 
his behaviour tune in this as well as in every other particular

mr harrison who attended her day still talked hold of a speedy recovery and in blood was equally sanguine

he tried to moon him out of fear which the different judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd

rejoicing that in her letter to her mother the had pursued her own judgment rather than her friends in making very light of the disposition which delayed them at livedand and almost ring on the time when marriage would be able to travel 
but the day did not close so suspiciously as it began 
towards the evening variance became ill again growing more heavy rest less and uncomfortable than before 
her sister however till sanguine was willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of having let up to have bed made 
and carefully 1 administering the cordial prescribed saw her with satisfaction wink at last into a slumber from which the expected the most beneficial effects 
here though not so quiet as editor wished to see it lasted a considerable time 
and anxious to observe the result of it herself she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it 
my bearings knowing nothing of any change in the patient went unusually early to bed 
her maid who was one of the principal herself was retreating herself in the housekeeper room and finer remained alone with variance 
the repose of the latter became more and more disturbed 
and her sister who watched with permitting attention her continual change of posture and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint which pcasedherli was almost wishing to rouse terror to painful a embers when variance suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in the house turned hastily up and with feverish mildness cried out n. key if sense and sensible

her fears he had no courage no confidence to attempt the removal of

but her difficulties were instantly obviate for with i readiness that learned to speak the occasion and the service prearranged in his mind he offered itself up the messenger who should fetch my wood 
liquor made no since that was not easily overcome 
she danced him with a brief though fervent gratitude and while he went to hurry of his earth with a needle to mr hairs and an order for pin-money direct ill wrote a few line to her mother the comfort of such a friend at that moment an colonel grandson

the horses arrived even before they were expected and colonel grandson only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear hurried into the it was then about twelve o'clock and she returned to her since s a t to wait for the arrival of the apothecary to watch by her the rent of the night

her apprehensions once failed paid by their excess for all her former security and the servant who at up with her for she would not allow me leaning to be called only tortured her more by hints of what her had own than t 
hg'ianne’s ideas were still at intervals vexed incoherent on her mother and whenever she mentioned her name it gave a pang to the heart of poor editor who making herself for having tried with man days mum and wretched for some immediate relief fancied that all relief might soon he in vain that everything had been delayed too long and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving too late to see this darling child 
or to see her rational 
she was on the point of sending again for mr harrison 18 sue and smsrnxurv 
or if be could not come for some other advice when the former 
but not till after vex o'clock 
arrived 
his opinion however made some little amends for his delay for though acknowledging a very unexpected and up elegant alteration in his patient he would not allow the danger to be material and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must procure with a conscience which in a longer degree we communicated to minor 
he promised to call again in the come of three or four hours and left both the paint and her anxious attendant more composed thanked found them 
with strong concern and with man approaches for not being called to their aid did my emma hear in the morning of what had parted 
her former apprehemiooa now with greater moon restored left her no doubt of the event 
— and though trying to speak comfort to minor her conviction of her fittest danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope 
her heart was really grieved 
the rapid day the early death of a girl is young so lovely as variance must have struck a let inference person with concern 
on man leaning age companion she had another claims 
she had been for three month her companion was still under her care and the was known to have been greatly injured and long unhappy 
the distress of her finger too particularly favourite wan before her 
— 
and no for their mother when mrs joining considered that marriage might probably be to bar what charlotte vain to herself her sympathy in her offering was very sincere 
mr harrison wan punctual in his second visit 
— but he came to be disappointed in his hope 
of what the but would produce 
all medicine had failed g 
the fever was unabated 
and marriage only more quiet 
not more hemlf+remained in an heavy an r. eleanor catching all and more than all his fear to a moment sense and snusrnxu'rv 
its proposed to call in farther advice but he judged it unneoelu 
he had still something more to try come fresh application of whose scene he was almost a comment on the inn and his visit concluded with encouraging instances which reached the ear but could not enter the hem of ice dnahwood 
she wan calm 
except when he thought of her mother but the was almost hopeless 
and in this rate she continued till noon scarcely stirring from her sister s bed her thoughts wandering from one image of grief one suffering fiend to another and her spirit oppressed to the utmost by the company of mrs beginnings who adopted not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition which marines disappointment had brought on 
liquor felt all the reasonableness the idea and it gave fresh meryton her reflection 
about noon however 4 the began 
— but with a caution i dread of some disappointment which for some time kept her silent even to her friend 
to fancy to hope she could perceive a alight amendment in her later i pulse 
— she waited watched examined it again and again 
— and at it with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness than all her foregoing distress ventured to communicate her hopes 
man leaning though forced on examination to acknowledge a temporary revival tried to keep her young friend from indulging a thought of it 
continuance 
and finer coming over every injunction afflict-rust told her self likewise not to hope 
at it was too late 
hope had already entered 
and feeling all in anxious matter the bent over her sister to watch 
she hardly knew for what 
half an hour passed away and the favourable symptom yet blessed her 
others even arose to control it

of amendment an variance vexed her 15 sense and sensibility

quietly and hope now oppressed her in equal degrees and left her no moment of tranquillity till the arrival of mr arrive at four o'clock 
— when his assurance hire felicitations on a recovery in her lift even surpassing hit expectation gave her confidence comfort and turn of 
iiirianne was in every respect materially better and he declared her entirely out of danger 
man leaning perhapiatieﬁed with the partial justification of her foreboding which had been found in their late alarm allowed herself to trust in his judgment and admitted with unfeigned joy and noon with unequivocal cheerfulness the probability of an entire recovery 
liquor could not be cheerful 
her joy was of a different kind and led to anything rather than to society 
variance rcttnrcd to life health fiend and to her doctrines mother was an idea to all her head with imitations of exquisite comfort and explained it in fervent gratitude 
but it led to no outward demonstration of joy no words no trifler 
all within elinor‘a breast satisfaction talent and among 
she continued by the side of her sister with little intention the whole afternoon calling every fear satisfying every inquiry of her enabled pill supplying every humour and watching almost every look angel every breath 
the possibility of a relapse would of course in some moments occur to remind her of what anxiety waft 
but when the saw on her frequent and minute examination that every symptom of recovery continued and raw alliance at six o'clock sink into a quiet steady and to all a brace come ramble it he silenced every doubt 
up up the time was now drawing on when colonel grandson might be expected back 
at ten o'clock the trusted or at least not much later her mother would i sense and sensibility 
15 be relieved from the dreadful an in which she mum 
now be travelling towards them 
the colonel too 
— perhaps scarcely less an object of pity 1 
— or how slow was the progress of time which yet kept then in i once 
t seven o'clock leaving variance still sweetly asleep she joined mrs joining in the drawing-room to tea 
of breakfast she had been kept by her fears and of dinner by their sudden reverse from eating much 
— and the present refreshment therefore with such feelings of content as she brought to it was particularly welcome 
mrs beginnings would have persuaded her at its conclusion to take some rest before her mother arrival and allow bar to take her place by marriage 
but liquor had no sense of fatigue no capability of sleep at that tom about her and she was not to he sway from her sister an inner instant 
as beginnings therefore attending her up mine into the sick chamber to satisfy harberseli that all continued right left her there again to her charge and her thoughts and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep 
the night was cold and stormy 
the wind roared round the house and the man bent against the windows 
but liquor all happiness within regarded it not 
variance slept through every blast and the travellers 
— they had a rich reward in store for every present inconvenience 
the clock struck eight

a if that is all you may be satisfied already 
for marriage does 
she has long forgiven you 
has she 
— he cried in the same eager tone 
— then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it 
but she shall forgive me again and on more reasonable grounds 
now will you fasten me 
a minor bowed her assent 
i do not know a said he after a pause of expectation on her side and thoughtfulness on his own 
a how you may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me 
perhaps you will hardly think the better of me 
it is worth the trial however and you shall her everything 
when i first became intimate in your family i had no other intention no other view in the soqumntanoe than to my time pleasantly while i was obliged to remain in ‘evonshire more pleasantly than i had ever done before 
your sister lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me 
and her behaviour to me almost from the first was of a kind 
it is astonishing when i reflect on what i was and what the was that my heart should have been so insensible 1 
but at first i must confess my vanity only was elevated by it 
careless of her happiness thinking only of my own amusement giving way to feelings which i had always been too much in the habit of indulging i endeavoured by every means in my power to make myself pleasing to her without any design of returning her affection miss dashed at this point turning her eyes on 16 sun and snusmu'rv

such a begin 
sing as this can not be follow by anything 
do not let me be pained by hearing anything more on the subject 
i s 1 1 i insist on your hearing the whole of it a he replied 
a my fortune was never large and i had always been expensive always in the habit of associating with power of better income than myself 
every year since my coming of age or even before i believe had added to my d 
and though the death of my old cousin mrs smith was to set me free yet that event being uncertain and in far distant it had been for some time my intention to re-establish in circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune 
of attach myself to your sister therefore was not a thing to thought of 
and with a meanness selfishness cruelty 
which no indignant no contemptuous look even of yours miss dashed can ever reprobates too much 
i was acting in this manner trying to engage her regard without a thought of reading it 
but one thing my be said for me even in that horrid state of selfish vanish i did not know the extent of the injury i meditate because i did not but know what it was to love 
but have 1 ever known it ll 
well may it be doubted 
for had i really loved could i have sacrifice my feelings to vanity to avarice 
— or what is more could i have sacrificed hers e 
but i have done it 
to avoid i come alive poverty which her affection and her society wo d have deprived of all its horrors i have by raising myself to influence lost everything that could make it a blessing 1 you did then a said eleanor a little softened 1 believe yourself at one time attached to her sense 
and swsibiwi 1 to have ruined such attractions to have withstood inch tenderness 
is there a man on earth who could have done it ll 
yes i found myself by insensible degrees sincerely fond of her 
and the happiest hours of my life were what i spent with her when i felt my intentions were strictly honourable and m feelings blameless 
even men however when fully determined on paying my addressed to her i allowed myself moor improper to put off from day to day the moment of doing it from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while m circumstances were so greatly embarrassed 
i not remain here 
nor will i up for you to expatiated on the absurdity and the worst than absurdity of struggling to engage my faith where my honour was ahead bound 
he event has proved that i was a cunning to providing with great circumspection for a possible of rarity of making myself console and wretch for ever 
at last however my reason union wan taken and i had determined as noon as i could engage her alone to justify the intention had so invariably paid her and openly assure her of an affection which i had already taken such pains to display 
but in the interior 
in the interior of the very few hours that were to before i could have an opportunity of making with her in private 
a circumstance occupied an unlucky circumstance to mine all my resolution and with it all my comfort 
a discovery took lace 1 
here he hesitated and looked down mrs smith had meadows or other been informed i imagine by some distant relation whose interest it w to give me of her favour of an affair a connexion 
but need not explain myself farther he added looking at her with a heightened colour and an inquiring eye your part clear intimacyuyou have probably heard the whole story long a -5 1 i bye returned eleanor colouring likewise and to 18 sun up just

oh 
how infinitely superior

i must say it unpleasant to me an the discussion of such a subject may well be

a did not recollect that i had omitted to give her my direction 
and common-sense might have told her how to and it out sense 
and sensibility 9 well sir and what said mrs smith in a she taxed with the fence at once and my confusion may be guessed 
the purity of her life the formality of her notions her i dance of the world 
everything was against me 
he matter itself i could not deny and vain was every endeavour to soften it 
she was obviously disposed i believe to doubt the morality of my conduct in general and was moreover discontented with the veil little attended the very little portion of my time that hid bestowed on her in my present visit 
in short it ended in a total breach 
by one measure i might have saved myself 
in the her hat of her morality good woman 
she offered to forgive the if i would marry eliza 
that could not be 
— and was formally dismissed from her favour and her 
house 
the night following this affair 
i was to go the next morning 
was spent me in deliberating on what my future conduct should 
the struggle was great 
— 
but it ended too soon 
my affection for marriage my thorough conviction of her attachment to name 
it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches which i was natural inclined to feel and expensive society had inure 
i had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife if i chose to address her and i persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do 
an heavy scene however awaited me before i could leave derbyshire 
i was engaged to dine with you on that very day some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking the engagement 
but whether i should write this a low or deliver it in person was 3 dint of long to

i could not bear to leave the country in i manner that might lead you or the rest of the neighbourhood to expect any part of what had really ranked between man smith and myself and i resolved therefore on calling at the cottage in my way to horizon 
the light of your dear sister however was really dreadful 
and to heighten the matter i found her alone

that open affectionate and lively manner which it no merit pone-11nd by that still 10 skins and sensibility 
silent love for mnrisnne which it was not even infinite vent to indulge 
but she felt that it was so long long before she could feel his influence less 
when at last ill returned to the unconscious marriage she found her just waking refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her home

the past the recent the futurewilloughby’s visit marines ugly and her mother expected arrival threw her altogether into an agitation of epithets which kept of every indication of fatigue and 
may e her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister 
short was the time however in which that fear could affect her for within half-an-hour after willoughby'e leaving the home she was again called down-mire by the sound of another carriage 
eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment's horrible love peace she ran immediately into the hall and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it 
mrs wood where terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of marianne’l being no more had no voice to inquire after her no voice even for liquor 
but be waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry instantly gave the joyful relief 
— and her mother catching it with all her usual warmth was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness as she had been before by her fears 
she was supported into the drawing-room between her daughter and her friend and there shedding tears of joy though still unable to speak embraced eleanor again nod again turning from her at intervals to press 
colonel undone hand with a look which spoke at once her gratitude and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the blue of the moment

which we all the intelligence of edward afforded her by the correspondence for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letter

but not to hide long 
they will soon he back again and then they be cure and call here mrs wood now looked at her daughter 
but liquor knew better than to expect them 
she recognized the whole of lucy in the manage and was very confident that edward would never come near them 
she observed in a low voice to her mother that they were probably going down to mr l’ratt’l near 1 month

i was afraid of being lately a did mrs errant look well 2 1 yes manor she said how she was very well 
and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady 
and she seemed vastly contented 
mrs dashed could think of no other question and thomas and the table-cloth now alike needless were soon after dismissed 
marriage had already sent to say that she should eat nothing more 
mrs dashwood's and finer s appetite were equally lost and margaret might think herself very well off that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced so much reason as they had often had to be careless of the meals she had never been obliged to go without her dinner here 
when the dessert and the wine were arranged and mrs dashed and finer were left to themselves they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfiilneand silence 
mrs dashed feared to hazard any remark and ventured not to offer consolation 
she now found that she had erred in relying on eleanor's representation of herself 
and justly concluded that 
everything had been expressly softened at the time to spare her from an increase of unhappiness suffering as she then had suffered for marriage 
she found that she had been misled by the careful the considerate attention of her daughter to think the attachment which once she had so well understood 
much brighter in reality than she had been wont to believe or than it was now proved to be 
she feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust inattentive 
nay 
almost unkind to her eleanor 
that marines affliction because more acknowledged more immediately before her had too much engrossed her tenderness and led her away to sense and sensibility

chapter ﬁll-13 
liquor new found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event however sermon the mind m be told to consider it and certainty itself 
she now found that in spite of herself she had always admitted a hope while edward remained single that something would occur to prevent his marrying lucy 
that some resolution of his own some edition of friends or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady would arise to assist the happiness of all 
but he was now married and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery which so much heightened the pain the intelligence 
that he should be married so soon before as she imagined he could be in orders and consequently before he could be in possession of the living surprised her a little at first 
but she soon saw how likely it was that lucy in her self-evident care in her haste secure him should overlook everything but the risk of delay 
they were married married in town and now hastening down to her uncle 
what had edward felt on being within four miles of parson on seeing her mother servant on hearing lucy message 
they would soon she supposed be settled at dear old 
delayed that place in which so much consigned to give her an interest 
which she wished to be acquainted with and yet desired to avoid 
she saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house

— pushing her own lantern in every thou hat owning the favour of colonel blow of men running and of every wealthy friend 
in edward she knew not what the law nor what the wished to see 
ham or unhappy 
nothing placed her 
— she hunted away her head from every sketch of him 
l'ilinor flattered herself that some one of their connexions in london would write to them to announce the event and give farther particulars 
but day after day passed off and brought no letter no tidings 
though uncertain that any one were to blame the found fault with every absent friend 
they were all thoughtless or indolent 
a when do you write to colonel grandson modern 2 2 was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on 
a i wrote to him my love last week and rather expect to see than to hear from him again 
i mostly pressed his coming to us and should not be surprised to see him walk in to-day or to-morrow or any day this was gaining something something to look forward to

he stopped at their gate 
it was it gentleman it was colonel grandson himself 
now she should hear more

but 
it was not colonel brandonuneither his air nor his height 
were it possible she should say it must be edward

he had just dismount

as in a moment she perceived that the other were likewise aware of the mistake 
she saw her mother and marriage change colour 
saw them look at herself and whisper a few sentences to each other 
she would have given the world to be able to speak 
and to make them understand that she hoped no coolness no slight would appear in their behaviour to him 
— 
but she had no utterance and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion 
not a syllable passed aloud 
they all waited in silence for the appearance of their visitor 
his footsteps were heard along the gravel path 
in a moment he was in the passage and in another he was before them 
his countenance as he entered the room was not too happy even for liquor 
his complexion was white with agitation and he looked as it fearful of his reach line and conscious that he merited no kind one 
is dashed however conforming as she trusted to the wishes of that daughter by whom the then meant in the warmth of her heart to be guided in everything met him with a look of forced complacency gave him her hand and wished him joy 
he coloured and atammcrcd out an unintelligible reply 
eleanor's lips had moved with her mother and when the moment of action was over she wished that the had shaken hands with him too 
but it was then too late and with a countenance meaning to be open she sat down again and talked of the weather 
marriage had retreated as much as possible out of sight to conceal her distress 
and margaret understanding some part but not the whole of the case thought it incumbent on her to he signed and therefore took a seat as far from him as she could and maintained a attic silence 
when liquor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season a very awful pause took place 
it was put 1806 sense and sensibility 
an end to by my daahwood who felt obliged to hope that he had left mrs feared very well 
in a hurried manner he replied in the affirmative 
another pause 
liquor resolving to exert herself though fearing the sound of her own voice now said

he replied with an air of surprise 
a no my mother is in town a i meant it eleanor taking up some work from the table 1 to inquire after my edward ferrari.” she dared not look up 
— but her mother and marriage both turned their eyes on him 
he coloured seemed perplexed looked doubtingly and after some hesitation said 
—

my brother 
you mean mere 
more rain fervent a man robert terror 
-5 was repeated by marriage and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement 
— and though eleanor could not speak even per eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder 
he rose from his seat and walked to the window apparently from not knowing what to do 
took up a pair of scissors that lay there and while spouting both them and their seat by cutting the latter to pieces an he spoke said in an hurried voice 
— a perhaps you do not know 
you may not have hand that my brother is lately married to

in what at the affair stood at present between them edward knew not for no communication with anyofhisfunilyhsdyetheenattempted hymen 
he had quieted oxford within four-and-twenty hours after lucy s letter arrived end with on one object before him the nearest mad meryton had no leisure to form an scheme of conduct with which that road did not the most intimate connexion 
he could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with mine wood 3 end by his rapidity in seeing that fate it in to be supposed in ten of the jealous with which he had once thought of colonel 
london 
in spite of the with which he met his own deserts and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts lie did notuponthewhoe expect me relic ton 
was his business however to act he rﬁdflnhd he said it very prettily 
what he might say on the subject a twelvemonth safer must he he erred to the imagination of huahnnda send wives 
that lucy had certainly meant to deceive to go of with s fourth of malice against him in her e by them was my clear to minor 
and e ward thinner now you d enlightened on her character had no end 
lie in giving her ca leg of the utmost woe wanton ill-nature 
though i had 4 sense and sensibility 
been long opened even before hit acquaintance with editor began to her ignorance and a want of liberty in some of her opinion they had been guilty impute by him to her want of education 
and till her last letter reached him he had all believed his i to be a girl disposed good-hearted girl and through my attach to himself 
nothing but inch 1 perturbation could have prevented hit putting an end to an engagement which on before the discovery of it laid him open to hit month anger had been 3 continual source of quiet and regret to him 
i thought it my duty a said he independent of my feelings to give her the operation of concerning the engagement or not when i war renounced by my mother and mood to all appearance without a friend in the world to insist me 
in inch 3 agitation at that where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature how could i suppose when the to earnestly to early insisted on sharing my fate whatever it might be that anything but the most disinterested affection was her-inducement 
and even now i cannoti comprehend on what motive the acted or what fancied advantage it could be to her to be uttered to a mind for whom the had not the smallest regard and who had only two thousand pounds in the world 
she could not forgets that colonel grandson would give me i live 
of but the might suppose that something would occur in your favour 
that your own family might in time resent 
and at animate the lost nothing by continuing the engagement for the hat proved that it flattered neither her inclination nor her actions 
the connexion was certainly a respectable one and probably gained her condition among her friend 
and if nothing more advantageous occurred it would be better for her to marry you than he mingled sense and sensibility 
2 edward was of course immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than lucy one fact nor more self-evident than the motive of it 
liquor scolded him harshly as ladies always scold the impnrdcnoe which compliments themselves for having spent so much home with them at morland when he melt 
have felt his own inconstancy 
your behaviour was certainly very wrong a said she a because 
to say nothing of my own conviction 
our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect wm as you were ten situated could never been he could only plead an ignorance of his own heart and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement 
a i was simple enough to think that because my family wan plighted to another there could be no danger in my being with you 
and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred up my honour 
i felt that i admired you but i told myself it wan only friendship 
and till i began to make comparisons between yourself and lucy i did not know how far i was got 
after that i cup see i m wrong in remaining so much in guesses antixihc argument with which i mooncilcd myself to the expediency of it were no better than these 
t he danger is my own i i am doing no injury to anybody but myself 
liquor smiled and shook her head 
edward heard with pleasure of colonel brandon's being expected at the cottage as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him but to have an opportunity of convincing him thathenolonger resented hart giving him the living of holford 
a which at present a said he a after thanks ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion he must think i have never forgiven him for offering 
now he felt raised himself that he had never yet been to the place 
but so little interest had he taken in 26 sense and sensrsrurv 
the matter that he owed all his knowledge of the house ardent and glare extent of the rich condition of the and and rate of the tithes to minor herself who had heard so much of it from colonel branch and heard it with so much attention as to entirely mistress of the subject 
no question after this only remained undecided between them one difficulty only was to be overcome 
they were brought together by mutual affection with the warmest wrap approbation of their real friends 
their intimate knew be of each other seemed to make their happiness certain 
and they only wanted something to live upon 
edward had two thousand pounds and finer one which with delayed living was all that they could call their own 
for it was impossible that mrs dushwood should advance anything and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and my months a year would supply them with the comforts of a 
edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change e in his mother towards him 
and on that he rested or the residence of their income 
but liquor had no such dependence 
for since edward would still be unable to marry miss mutton and his chusing herself had been spoken of in mrs fen-ars’s flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing lucy steal she feared that robert olﬁmoc would serve no other purpose than to enrich fanny 
about four days after edward s arrival colonel grandson appeared to complete my dashwood’s satisfaction an to give her the dignity of having for the first time since her living at baron more company with her than her house would hold 
edward was allowed to retain the privilege of ﬁrst-comer and colonel grandson therefore walked every night to his old quarters at the park 
from whence he usually returned in the sense and sensibility 
for morning earl enough to interrupt the love lit titea-tétc before refute 
a three weeks reduce it holford where in evening hour at lemhehadlittletodobuttocalenlate the disproportion between thirty-one nod mum brought him to parson in a turn m of mind which needed all the improvement in morrmne’e lock all the kindness of her welcome and all the encourage of her mother’language to make it cheerful 
among each friend 
however and we latterly he did revive 
no rumour of luck marriage had yet reached him 
he knew nothing of what had paused and the list hour of hit visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering 
everything wan explained to him by my wood and he found fresh moon to rejoice in what he had done for mr farm since eventually it promoted the interest of eleanor it would be needed to nay that the gentlemen advanced in the good opinion of each other a they advanced in each other acquaintance for it could not be otherwise 
their remembrance in good principle 
and good serve in dispositions end manner of thinking would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship without any other attraction 
but their being in love with two linen and two listen fond of each other made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment 
the letter-boy town which a few before would have made every serve in elinor’e body thrill with transport now arrived to be read with leaf emotion than mirth 
my bearings wrote to tell the wonderful able to vent her honest indignation against the jilt andpourforthhercompouiontowardlpoor ward who nhewnuure hadquitedoated upon worthless hue and was now by all accounts

i do think 4 the con.208 sense 
and slnslblllty 
turned “nothingwaseveroaniedonsosly 
forsters but two days before lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me 
not a soul suspected anything of the matter not even many who poor soul 
came crying to me the day after in a great fright for fear of terror as well as not knowing how to get to plymouth 
for lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married on pug we sup 
rose to make a shewwitluandpoor ached not seven shillings in the world 
— so i was very glad to give her over news to take her down to exeter where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with mrs burden in hopes as i tell her to fall in with the doctor again 
and i must say that lucy crossness not to take her along with them in the chaise is worse than all 
poor mr edward 
i can not t him out of my head but you run send for him to anyone and miss variance coat try to comfort him mr dashwood’s strains were more solemn 
mrs terror was the most unfortunate of women 
poor fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility 
and he considered the existence of each under inch a blow with grateful wonder 
robert offence was on but lucy was infinitely worse 
neither of them was ever again to be mentioned to mrs terror 
and even if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter nor be admitted to anger in her presence 
the secrecy which every sing had~heen carried on between them was rationally treated as enormous heightening the crime because had any suspicion of it occurred on the others proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage 
and he called on eleanor to join with him in regretting that such as engagement with edward had not ratherlbeen fun led than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family 
he thus continued
