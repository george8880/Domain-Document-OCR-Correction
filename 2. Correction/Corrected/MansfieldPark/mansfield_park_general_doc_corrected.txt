e do not look in great citiel for our best morality 
it in not there that respectable people of any denomination can do rnoat good 
and it certainly it not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt 
a one preacher in followed and admired 
but it it not in one preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in him pariah and hit neighbourhood where the parish and neighbourhood are of a rite capable of knowing hit private character and observing his general conduct which in london unscrew max 
do can rarely be the clue 
the de are look there in the code of their hey are known to the largest part only a treachery 
and with regard to their inﬂuencing blrc mannera mine crawford molt not minmdentandmme or suppose i mean to call them the arbiters of good breeding the regulation of refinement and journey the mute of the ceremony of life 
the arm i speak of might rather be called tendon 
perhaps the mule of good rincipleu the effect in short of those doctrine which it it their duty to teach and recommend 
and it will i believe be e found that up the clergy are or are not what they ought to be no are the m of the nation b c certainly a said fanny

convinced min price already

you really are at for anything better 
come do change your mind 
it in not too ate

i am a very matter-of-fect plaintpoken being and may blunder on the border of a name for half-an-hour together without wasting it out 
a general silence succeeded 
each was thoughtful 
faun made the first interruption by saying a i wonder that would be tired with only walking in thin tweet 98 nmsnnm park 
wood 
but the next time we come to a neat if it it not diugreenble to you i should be glad to sit down for a little while 
a my dear fanny cried edmund immediately drawing her arm within his how thoughtless i have been i i hope on ere not very tired 
perhaps turning to mint word my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm 
a thank you but i am not at all red 
she took it however on the spoke and the gratification of having her do i of feeling ouch a connection for the in time made him a little forgetful of fanny 
you ecareely touch me 
said he 
b you do not make me of any one 
what i difference in the weight of a woman am from that of a men 
at oxford i have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a street and you are only it fly in the common 
a i am really not tired which i almost wonder it 
for we must have walked at least a mile in thin wood 
do not you think we have p d not half a mile was his study answer 
for he wan not at so much in love an to secure dinance or reckon tune with feminine lawleuneu 
a oh 
you do not considered how much we have wound about 
we have taken inch a very mine counsel and the wood itself must be half a mile long in a right line for we have never seen the end of it yet alice we left the first great path.” a but if you remember before we left that at great path we saw directly to the end of it 
we looked down the whole vista and law it cloud by iron gates and it could not have been more more than a curling in length a sob 
i know nothing of your furlongl but i am sure it is a very long wood and that we have been unusnntn‘ park

and therefore when l nay that we have walked i mile in it i must speak within campus 
we have been exact a quarter of an hour here a laid edmund taking out his watch 
a do you think we are walking four mile an hour 
a oh i do not attack me with your watch

you will convince yourself that it can not be half a mile long or half half a mile 
a it it on iinmenoe distance a laid the

she would not calculate the would not compare 
she would only mile and alert 
the greater degree of rational contittency could not have been more engtging and they talked with mutual eatiofnction 
at but it van a that they could endeavour to determine the direction of the wood by walking a little more about it 
they would go to one end of it in the line they were then in for there war a train ht green walk along the bottom by the tide of the hag and perhaps turn a little way in name other direction if it leerned likely to unite them and be back in a few minutes 
fanny laid the war rested and would have moved too but that vale not tailored 
edmund urged her remaining where the wan with an came-men which the could not rein and the w left on the bench to think with pleasure of her coming care but with great regret that the was not stronger 
she watched them till they had turned the comer and listened till all round of them had ceased

she limed and at length she heard

but the had just satisfied himself that it was not there the wanted when mira bertram mr rulhworth and mr crawford issued from the lame path which all had trod herself and were before her

a were the hint nations 
she told her story 
a poor dear fanny a cried her cousin how ill you have been used by them 
you had better have said with us 
then renting herself with a gentleman on each side the returned the conversation which had engaged them before and discussed the inability of imurovcmcma with much animation 
nothing was fixed on

so far from being all invited and enjoying the found everybody requiring something they had not and giving occasion ofditcontent to the other 
everybody had a part either too in or too short 
nobody would send ll they ought 
nobody would remember on which side they were to come in 
nobody but the complainer would observe my directions 
fanny believed herself to derive us much innocent enjoyment from the play as any of them 
henry crewfoni toned well and it was a pleasure to hers creep into the treasure and attend the rehearsal of the hint act in spite of the feelings it excited in some t for maria 
maria the also thought tcted wel too well

she did not like him at a man but the must admit him to be the best actor and on this t there were not many who differed from her 
mr ates indeed exclaimed again his lameness and insipidity and the day came at last when mr rulhworth turned to her with a black look and said a do you think there is within to very line in :11 this

the coming will be hung in a day or two 
there in very little sense in a play without a curtain 
and i am much mistaken if you do not and it drew up into very handsome feetoom 
a lady bertram teen-red quite resigned to waiting

the third would i my iiaksi'iild park

the whole of it was love 
a marriage of love to he deserved the gentleman and very little short of a declaration love he made by the lady 
she had read and the come a tin with many plinful many wondering emotion and looked forward to their reprelenution of it a a circumstance almost too interening 
she did not believe they had yet revealed it even in private 
the morrow came the pen her the evening continued and fanny consideration of it did not become leer agitated 
she worked very diligently under her aunt directions but her diligence and her silence concealed i very absent anxiour mind 
and about noon the made her escape with her work to the em room that the might have no concern in another and at the deemed it most unneoeotary rehearsal of the hint act which henry crawford viii jut proposing deliqu at once of having her time to herself and of avoiding the light of mr rulhworth 
a glimpse at the passed through the hall of the two ladies walking up from the parsonage made no change in her with o retreat and the worked and related in the east room undirturhed for a quarter ofan hour when a gentle tap at the door war followed by the entrance of in crawford

my dear mite price i beg your pardon

much more fitted for little girl

could sir then look in a n us just now he would bless himself for we are re coming ill over the home 
am is etonning away in the dining-room 
i heard him 1 
i came and the theatre is engaged of course by those indefatigable rehe-nen agatha and frederick 
if they are not perfect i shall be surprised 
by-the176 ianshild max 
bye i looked in upon them give minute ago and it happened tobeexectlylt oneofthe timeswhen they were trying not to embrace and mr rulhworth was with me 
i thought he began to look a little queer lo i turned it on 
well is i could by whispering to him a we shall have an excellent agatha there is something no autumn 
in her manner l0 completely animal in her voice countemuoe.’ was not that well done of me 
he brightened up directly 
now for my soliloqu 
she n and fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which the idea of representing edmund visit to strongly calculated to inspire 
but with looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of a man 
with such an anhalt however miss crawford had courage enough 
and they had got through half the scene when a tap at the door brought i pause and the entrance of edmund the next moment tuspendod it all 
surprise consciousness and pleasure appeared in each of the three on this unexpected meeting 
and as edmund was come on the very name business that had brought mine crawford connioumeu and pleasure were likely to be more than momentary in them 
he too had his book and wan seeking fanny to ask her to release with him and held him to prepare for the evening without knowing mus crawford to be in the home 
and great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown together of compassion schemes and say 
bathing in praise of fanny kin ofﬁces 
so could not equal them in their warmth 
her spirits sank under the glow of theirs and she felt herself becoming too nearly nothing to both to have any comfort in having been sought by either 
they must now rehearse together 
edmund proposed ur entreated it till the lady not very unwilling at rest iahsfibld park 
77 could refuse no longer and fanny was wanted only to prompt and observed them 
she wan invented indeed with the face of judge and critic and earnestly desired to exercise it and tell them all their faults 
but from doing to every feeling within her ehnnk 
she could not de not dared not 
after r. it had he been otherwiee qualified for criticism er comcience must have remained her from venturing at dilapprohotion 
she believed herself to feel too much of it in the aggregate or honenty or safety in particular 
to prompt them must be enough for her 
and it was sometimes more than enough 
for the could not always pay attention to the book 
in watching them she forgot henelf 
and agitated by the increasing spirit of edmund manner had once cloaked the page and turned away exactly ii he wanted help 
it wan imparted to very renewable weariness and the war thanked and pitied 
hut ilse deeerved their pity more than he hoped they would ever ennui-e. t seat the scene won over and fanny forced herself to odd her price to the compliment each wn ring the other 
and when again alone and able to real the whole the was inclined to believe their perfomunce would indeed have such nature and feeling in it an mult ensure their credit and make it a very anil'ering exhibition to herself

she wan nearly fainting all her former habitual dread of her uncle wan returning and with it companion for him and for salmon every one of the party on the development before him with solitude on edmund’l account indelcribable
