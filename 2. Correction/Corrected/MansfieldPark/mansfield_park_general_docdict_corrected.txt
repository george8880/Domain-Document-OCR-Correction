e do not look in great citiel for our best morality 
it in not there that respectable people of any denomination can do rnoat good 
and it certainly if not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt 
a one preacher in followed and admired 
but it it not in one preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his pariah and hit neighbourhood where the parish and neighbourhood are of a rite capable of knowing hit private character and observing his general conduct which in london unscrew max

and with regard to their inﬂuencing blrc mannera min crawford molt not minmdentandmme or suppose i mean to call them the arbiters of good breeding the regulation of refinement and journey the mute of the ceremony of life 
the arm i speak of might rather be called tendon 
perhaps the mule of good rincipleu the effect in short of those doctrine which it it their duty to teach and recommend 
and it will i believe be e found that up the clergy are or are not what they ought to be no are the rim of the national b c certainly a said fanny

i am a very matter-of-fect plaintpoken being and may blunder on the border of a name for half-an-hour together without writing it out 
a general silence succeeded 
each was thoughtful 
faun made the first interruption by saying a i wonder that would be tired with only walking in thin tweet 98 nmsnnm park 
wood 
but the next time we come to a neat if it it not diugreenble to you i should be glad to sit down for a little while 
a my dear fanny cried edmund immediately drawing her arm within his how thoughtless i have been i i hope on ere not very tired 
perhaps turning to mint word my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm 
d thank you but i am not at all red 
she took it however on the spoke and the gratification of having her do i of feeling ouch a connection for the into time made him a little forgetful of fanny

at oxford i have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a street and you are only it fly in the common 
d i am really not tired which i almost wonder it 
for we must have walked at least a mile in thin wood 
do not you think we have p d not half a mile was his curdy answer 
for he wan not at so much in love an to measure dinance or reckon tune with feminine lawleuneu 
a oh 
you do not considered how much we have wound about 
we have taken inch a very mine counter and the wood itself must be half a mile long in a night line for we have never seen the end of it yet alice we left the first great path 2 but if you remember before we left that at great path we saw directly to the end of it 
we looked down the whole vista and law it cloud by iron gates and it could not have been more more than a curling in length a job 
i know nothing of your furlongl but i am sure it is a very long wood and that we have been unusnntn‘ park

and therefore when l nay that we have walked i mile in it i must speak within campus 
we have been exact a quarter of an hour here a laid edmund eking out his watch

she would not calculate the would not compare 
she would only mile and alert 
the greater degree of rational contittency could not have been more engtging and they talked with mutual eatiofnction 
at lot it van a that they should endeavour to determine the direction of the wood by walking a little more about it 
they would go to one end of it in the line they were then in for there war a train ht green walk along the bottom by the tide of the hag and perhaps turn a little way in name other direction if it leerned likely to unite them and be back in a few minutes 
fanny laid the war rested and would have moved too but that vale not tailored 
edmund urged her remaining where the wan with an came-men which the could not rein and the w left on the bench to think with pleasure of her coming care but with great regret that the was not stronger

so far from being all invited and enjoying the found everybody requiring something they had not and giving occasion ofditcontent to the other 
everybody had a part either too in or too short 
nobody would attend ll they ought 
nobody would remember on which side they were to come in 
nobody but the plainer would observe my directions 
fanny believed herself to derive us much innocent enjoyment from the play as any of them 
henry crewfoni toned well and it was a pleasure to hector creep into the treasure and attend the rehearsal of the list act in spite of the feelings it excited in some t for maria

she did not like him at a man but the must admit him to be the best actor and on this t there were not many who differed from her 
mr ates indeed exclaimed again his lameness and insipidity and the day came at last when mr rulhworth turned to her with a black look and said a do you think there is within to very line in :11 this

she had read and the come a tin with many plinful many wondering emotion and looked forward to their reprelenution of it up a circumstance almost too interening 
she did not believe they had yet revealed it even in private 
the morrow came the pen her the evening continued and fancy consideration of it did not become leer agitated 
she worked very diligently under her aunt directions but her diligence and her silence concealed i very absent anxiour mind 
and about noon the made her escape with her work to the em room that the might have no concern in another and at the deemed it most unneoeotary rehearsal of the list act which henry crawford viii jut proposing delight at once of having her time to herself and of avoiding the light of mr rulhworth

i came and the theatre is engaged of count by those indefatigable rehe-nen agatha and frederick 
if they are not perfect i recall be surprised 
by-the176 ianshild max 
bye i looked in upon them over minute ago and it happened tobeexectlylt oneofthe timeswhen they were trying not to embrace and mr rulhworth wars with me 
i thought he began to look a little queer lo i turned it of 
well is i could by whispering to him 2 we shall have an excellent agatha there is something no autumn 
in her manner l0 completely animal in her voice countemuoe.’ was not that well done of me 
he brightened up directly 
now for my soliloqu 
she n and fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which the idea of representing edmund visit to strongly calculated to inspire 
but with looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of a man 
with such an animal however miss crawford had courage enough 
and they had got through half the scene when a tap at the door brought i pause and the entrance of edmund the next moment tuspendod it all 
surprise consciousness and pleasure appeared in each of the three on this unexpected meeting 
and as edmund was come on the very name business that had brought min crawford connioumeu and pleasure were likely to be more than momentary in them 
he too had his book and wan seeking fanny to ask her to repeated with him and held him to prepare for the evening without knowing mus crawford to be in the home 
and great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown together of complaint schemes and say 
sympathizing in praise of fanny kin ofﬁces 
so could not equal them in their warmth 
her spirits sank under the glow of theirs and she felt herself becoming too nearly nothing to both to have any comfort in having been sought by either 
they must now rehearse together 
edmund proposed ur entreated it till the lady not very unwilling at rest iahsfibld park 
177 could reﬁne no longer and fanny was wanted only to prompt and observed them 
she wan invented indeed with the office of judge and critic and earnestly desired to exercise it and tell them all their faulu 
but from doing to every feeling within her ehnnk 
he could not de not dared not 
after r. it had he been otherwiee qualified for criticism er comcience must have remained her from venturing at dilapprohotion 
she believed herself to feel too much of it in the aggregate or honenty or safety in particular 
to prompt them must be enough for her 
and it was sometimes more than enough 
for the could not always pay attention to the book 
in watching them she forgot henelf 
and agitated by the increasing spirit of edmund manner had once cloaked the page and turned away exactly ii he wanted help 
it wan imparted to very renewable weariness and the war thanked and pitied 
hut ilse deeerved their pity more than he hoped they would ever ennui-e. t last the scene won over and fanny forced herself to odd her price to the compliment each wn ring the other 
and when again alone and able to real the whole the was inclined to believe their perfomunce would indeed have such nature and feeling in it an mult ensure their credit and make it a very anil'ering exhibition to herself

she wan nearly fainting all her former habitual dread of her uncle wan returning and with it companion for him and for salmon every one of the party on the development before him with solitude on edmund’l account indelcribable 
she had found a seat where in exceetive trembling she was enduring all these fearful thoughts while the other three no longer under any renraint were giving vent to their feeling 
of vexation larnenu'ng over much an unlooked-for premature arrival up a most untoward event and without waiting poor sir thomas had been twice ll long on hll palaces or were ihall in antigua 
the crawford were more worm on the subject than mr year from better understanding the family and udging more clearly of the mischief that must enaue

and when on hsving courage to lift her eyes to his face she saw that he was grown thinner and had the burn fagged worn look of fatigue and s hot climate every tender feeling was increased and she was miserable in considering how much unsuspected person was probably ready to burn on him 
sir thomas was indeed the life of the party who at his s stone now seated themselves round the free
