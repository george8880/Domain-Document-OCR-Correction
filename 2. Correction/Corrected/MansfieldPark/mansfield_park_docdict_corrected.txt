all the intent on the sofa to which the had treated that the miss has not he been the pain of her mind had been much beyond that in her head

the sotherton ichelne wamentioned of course 
it war hard 
pitiable indeed that anything clue should be talk of for mr norrie wan in high lplriﬂ about it 
and mr rulhworth a well-meaning civil proaing pompoua woman who thought nothing of consequence but up it related to her own and her joys conceit had not yet given over purring lady bertram to be of the part 
lady bertram cannantly declined it 
but her placed manner of refute made an rulhworth ihall think the wished to come till mr norrir’t more numerous wordand louder tone convinced her of the truth

i will answer for his being most happy to join the sky 
he can go on horseback you know my nahworth being obliged to yield to lady bertnln’a staying at home could only be sorry 
the loss of her ladyship comp-n would be a great drawback and she should have extremely happy to have seen the young lady too miss price who had never been at sotherton yet and it wan a pity the should not see the nieces a you are very kind you are all kindness my dear madam cried mrs norrie 
but an to fanny he will have opportunitiea in plenty of seeing sotherton 
she but time enough before her 
and her going now in quite out of the question 
lady bertram could not poall'hly appease her 
oh no i i can not do without fanny mn rulhworth proceeded next under the conviction that every body must be wanting to see sotherton to include in rawi'ord in the invitation 
and though my trust who had not been at the trouble of visiting an rulhworth on her coming into the neighbourhood civilly declined it on her own account 
she was glad to secure any pleasure for her linen and mary proof by preaaed an we not long in keeping s share of the civility

their road was through a pleasant country 
and 84 nausrmm max 
fanny whole rider had never been expensive we none beyond her knowledge and was very happy in observing all that was new and admiring all that wan pretty 
she was not often invited to join in the conversation of the others nor did the desire it 
her own thoughts reflections were actually her best companion 
and in observing the appearance of the country the bearing 
of the road the difference of toil the late of the have the cottage the cattle the children the found entertainment that could only have been heightened by having edmund to upon to of what felt 
that wan the only point of retelnhlaoce between her and the lady who at by her in everything but a value for edmund miu crawford wan very unlike her 
she had none of fanny delicacy of rate of sound of feeling the law nature inanimate nature with little observation

for the light and lively 
in looking back after edmund however when there wan any stretch of road behind them or when he gained on them in sending a considerable hill they were united and a 1 there he ll broke at the am moment from them both more than once 
for the rest seven miles mia bertram had very little real comfort 
her prospects always ended in r crawford and her litter uttin ride by tide full of conversation and merriment 
an to see only his expreuive people at he turned with a mile to just is or to catch the laugh of the other was a perpetual source of invitation which her own sense propriety could but just mooth over 
when julia looked back it was with a countenance of delight and whenever the spoke to them it wan in the highest spirits a her view of the country was charming the wishes they all could see it a key but her only of her of exchange wan addressed to miss crawford no they gained the summit of a long ulnsrreu mule

i am a very matter-of-fect plaintpoken being and may blunder on the order of a name for half-an-hour together without waiting it out 
a general silence succeeded 
each was thoughtful 
four made the first interruption by saying a i wonder that should be tired with only walking in thin tweet 98 nmsnnm park

but the next time we come to a neat if it it not disagreeable to you i should be glad to sit down for a little while 
a my dear fanny cried edmund immediately drawing her arm within his bow thonghtleu i have been i i hope on ere not very tired 
perhaps turning to miss word my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm 
a thank you but i is not at all cared 
she took it however on the joke and the gratification of having her do is of feeling such a connection for the in time made him a little forgetful of fanny 
you early touch me

a you do not make me of any one 
what i difference in the weight of a woman am from that of a men 
at oxford i have been a good deal used to have a man leant on me for the length of a street and you are only it fly in the common 
a i am really not tired which i almost wonder it 
for we must have walked at least a mile in thin wood 
do not you think we have put a not half a mile was his story answer 
for he wan not eat so much in love an to secure dance or reckon tune with feminine lawleuneu 
a oh 
you do not consider how much we have wound about 
we have taken inch a very time counsel and the wood itself must be half a mile long in a night line for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left the first great path 1 but if you remember before we left that at great path we saw directly to the end of it 
we looked down the whole visit and law it cloud by iron gates and it could not have been more more than a failing in length a job 
i know nothing of your furlongl but i am sure it is a very long wood and that we have been unusnntn‘ park 
99 winding in and out ever since we came into it 
and therefore when l nay that we have walked i mile in it i must speak within campus 
we have been exactly a quarter of an hour here a laid edmund taking out his worth

she would not calculate the would not compare 
she would only mile and alert 
the greater degree of rational contittency could not have been more eating and they talked with mutual satisfaction 
at last it was a that they would endeavour to determine the dimensions of the wood by walking a little more about it 
they would go to one end of it in the line they were then in for there war a strain ht green walk along the bottom by the tide of the ha-hag and perhaps turn a little way in name other direction if it lessened likely to unite them and be back in a few minutes 
fanny laid the war rested and would have moved too but this vile not tailored 
edmund urged her remaining where the wan with an came-men which the could not resist and the w left on the bench to think with pleasure of her coming care but with great regret that the was not stronger

the whole of it was love 
a marriage of love to he described the gentleman and very little short of a declaration love he made by the lady 
she had read and the come a sin with many painful many wondering emotion and looked forward to their representation of it up a circumstance almost too interesting 
she did not believe they had yet repeated it even in private 
the morrow came the pen her the evening continued and fanny consideration of it did not become leer agitated 
she worked very diligently under her aunt directions but her diligence and her silence concealed i very absent anxiour mind 
and about noon the made her escape with her work to the em room that the might have no concern in another and at the deemed it most unneoeotary rehearsal of the list act which henry crawford viii jut proposing delight at once of having her time to herself and of avoiding the light of mr rulhworth

i heard him 1 
i came and the theatre is engaged of house by those indefatigable rehe-nen agatha and frederick 
if they are not perfect i shall be surprised 
by-the176 ianshild max

i thought he began to look a little queer lot i turned it of 
well is i could by whispering to him a we shall have an excellent agatha there is something no autumn 
in her manner so completely animal in her voice countemuoe.’ was not that well done of me 
he brightened up directly 
now for my soliloqu 
she s and fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which the idea of representing edmund visits to strongly calculated to inspire 
but with looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of a man 
with such an annual however miss crawford had courage enough 
and they had got through half the scene when a rap at the door brought i pause and the entrance of edmund the next moment tuspendod it all 
surprise consciousness and pleasure appeared in each of the three on this unexpected meeting 
and as edmund was come on the very name business that had brought min crawford connioumeu and pleasure were likely to be more than momentary in them 
he too had his book and wan seeking fanny to ask her to repeated with him and help him to prepare for the evening without knowing mus crawford to be in the home 
and great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown together of comparison schemes and say 
pathizing in praise of fanny kin ofﬁces 
she could not equal them in their warmth 
her spirits sank under the glow of theirs and she felt herself becoming too nearly nothing to both to have any comfort in having been sought by either 
they must now rehearse together 
edmund proposed or entreated it till the lady not very unwilling at rest iahsfibld park 
177 could repose no longer and fanny was wanted only to prompt and observed them 
she wan invented indeed with the office of judge and crime and eagerly desired to exercise it and tell them all their faults 
but from doing to every feeling within her think 
she could not de not dared not 
after r. it had she been otherwise qualified for criticism or conscience must have remained her from venturing at dilapprohotion 
she believed herself to feel too much of it in the aggregate or poverty or safety in particular 
to prompt them must be enough for her 
and it was sometimes more than enough 
for the could not always pay attention to the book 
in watching them she forgot henelf 
and agitated by the increasing spirit of edmund manner had once closed the page and turned away exactly ii he wanted help 
it wan imputed to very enviable weariness and the war thanked and pitied 
but else deeerved their pity more than she hoped they would ever ennui-e. t lasts the scene won over and fanny forced herself to odd her praise to the compliment each wn ring the other 
and when agnin alone and able to real the whole the was inclined to believe their performance would indeed have such nature and feeling in it an mult ensure their credit and make it a very anil'ering exhibition to herself

they walked off utterly heedless of mr ruahworth’a requested question of a shall i go too pen had not i better go too

she had been quite overlooked by her cousins

she wan nearly fainting all her former habitual dread of her uncle wan returning and with it companion for him and for salmon every one of the party on the development before him with solicitude on edmund’l account indelcribable 
she had found a seat where in exceetive trembling she was enduring all these fearful thoughts while the other three no longer under any restraint were giving vent to their feeling 
of vexation larnenu'ng over much an unlooked-for premature arrival up a most untoward events and without wishing poor sir thomas had been twice l long on hll plague or were ihall in antigua 
the crawford were more work on the subject than mr year from better understanding the family and doing more clearly of the mischief that must endure 
he train of the plays was to them a certainty they felt the total destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand 
while mr yates considered it only at a temporary interruption a dinner for the evening and could even suggest the nobility of the reheargl being renewed after tea wmdie bustle of receiving sir thomawere over and he mi but be it leisure to be amused by it

and when on having courage to lift her eyes to his face she saw that he was grown thinner and had the hursts fagged worn look of fatigue and s hot climate every tender feeling was increased and she was miserable in considering how much unsuspected venison was probably ready to burn on him 
sir thomas was indeed the life of the party who at his so strong now seated themselves round the care 
he bag the best right to he the talker 
and the delight of his sensations in being again in his own house in the centre of his family after such s separation made him communiutive sud chatty in a very unusual degree
