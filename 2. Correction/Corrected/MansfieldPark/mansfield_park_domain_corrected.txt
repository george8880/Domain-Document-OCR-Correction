i am a very matter-of-fact plaintpoken being and may blunder on the order of a name for half-an-hour together without waiting it out 
a general silence succeeded 
each was thoughtful

but the next time we come to a neat if it it not disagreeable to you i should be glad to sit down for a little while 
a my dear fanny cried demand immediately drawing her arm within his bow thoughtless i have been i i hope on ere not very tired 
perhaps turning to miss word my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm 
a thank you but i is not at all cared 
she took it however on the joke and the gratification of having her do is of feeling such a connection for the in time made him a little forgetful of fanny 
you early touch me 
said he 
a you do not make me of any one 
what i difference in the weight of a woman am from that of a men 
at oxford i have been a good deal used to have a man leant on me for the length of a street and you are only it fly in the common 
a i am really not tired which i almost wonder it 
for we must have walked at least a mile in thin wood 
do not you think we have put a not half a mile was his story answer 
for he wan not eat so much in love an to secure dance or reckon tune with feminine lawleuneu 
a oh 
you do not consider how much we have wound about 
we have taken inch a very time counsel and the wood itself must be half a mile long in a night line for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left the first great path 1 but if you remember before we left that at great path we saw directly to the end of it 
we looked down the whole visit and law it cloud by iron gates and it could not have been more more than a failing in length a job 
i know nothing of your furlongl but i am sure it is a very long wood and that we have been unusnntn‘ park 
39 winding in and out ever since we came into it 
and therefore when l nay that we have walked i mile in it i must speak within campits 
we have been exactly a quarter of an hour here a laid demand taking out his worth

i must go and look through that iron gate at the lame view without being able to see it i well 
edward left the seat likewise 
a now micrawford if you will look up the walk 
you will convince yourself that it can not be half a mile long or half half a mile 
a it it on immense distance 1 laid the

she would not calculate the would not compare 
she would only mile and alert 
the greater degree of rational consistency could not have been more eating and they talked with mutual satisfaction 
at last it was a that they would endeavour to determine the dimensions of the wood by walking a little more about it 
they would go to one end of it in the line they were then in for there war a strain hat green walk along the bottom by the tide of the hang and perhaps turn a little way in name other direction if it lessened likely to unite them and be back in a few minutes 
fanny laid the war rested and would have moved too but this vile not sailors 
edward urged her remaining where the wan with an casement which the could not reins and the w left on the bench to think with pleasure of her coming care but with great regret that the was not stronger 
she watched them till they had turned the comer and listened till all round of them had ceased

she had read and the come a sin with many painful many wondering emotion and looked forward to their representation of it up a circumstance almost too interesting 
she did not believe they had yet repeated it even in private 
the morrow came the pen her the evening continued and fanny consideration of it did not become lesser agitated 
she worked very silently under her aunt directions but her diligence and her silence concealed i very absent anxious mind 
and about noon the made her escape with her work to the em room that the might have no concern in another and at the deemed it most unnecessary rehearsal of the list act which henry strafford viii just proposing delight at once of having her time to herself and of avoiding the light of mr ashworth

well is i could by whispering to him a we shall have an excellent ayethat there is something no autumn 
in her manner so completely animal in her voice countemuoe.’ was not that well done of me 
he brightened up directly 
now for my soliloquy 
she s and fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which the idea of representing demand visits to strongly calculated to inspire 
but with looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of a man 
with such an annual however miss strafford had courage enough 
and they had got through half the scene when a rap at the door brought i pause and the entrance of edward the next moment suspended it all 
surprise consciousness and pleasure appeared in each of the three on this unexpected meeting 
and as edward was come on the very name business that had brought main strafford connioumeu and pleasure were likely to be more than momentary in them 
he too had his book and wan seeking fanny to ask her to repeated with him and help him to prepare for the evening without knowing must afford to be in the home 
and great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown together of comparison schemes and say 
paining in praise of fanny kin offices 
she could not equal them in their warmth 
her spirits sank under the glow of theirs and she felt herself becoming too nearly nothing to both to have any comfort in having been sought by either 
they must now reverse together 
edward proposed or entreated it till the lady not very unwilling at rest iahsfibld park 
47 could repose no longer and fanny was wanted only to prompt and observed them 
she wan invented indeed with the office of judge and crime and eagerly desired to exercise it and tell them all their faults 
but from doing to every feeling within her think 
she could not de not dared not 
after rap it had she been otherwise qualified for criticism or conscience must have remained her from venturing at disapprobation 
she believed herself to feel too much of it in the aggregate or poverty or safety in particular 
to prompt them must be enough for her 
and it was sometimes more than enough 
for the could not always pay attention to the book 
in watching them she forgot herself 
and agitated by the increasing spirit of edmund'a manner had once closed the page and turned away exactly ii he wanted help 
it wan imputed to very enviable weariness and the war thanked and pitied 
but else deserved their pity more than she hoped they would ever ennui t lasts the scene won over and fanny forced herself to odd her praise to the compliment each was ring the other 
and when again alone and able to real the whole the was inclined to believe their performance would indeed have such nature and feeling in it an must ensure their credit and make it a very answering exhibition to herself 
whatever i but he he effect however the man that the brunt of it again that very day 
the list regular rehearsal of the three am acts we
