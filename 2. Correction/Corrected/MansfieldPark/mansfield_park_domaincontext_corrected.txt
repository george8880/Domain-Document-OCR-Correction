the whole of it was love 
a marriage of love to he determined the gentleman and very little short of a declaration love he made by the lady 
she had read and the come a tin with many painful many wondering emotion and looked forward to their representation of it up a circumstance almost too interesting 
she did not believe they had yet repeated it even in private 
the morrow came the pen her the evening continued and fanny consideration of it did not become leer agitated 
she worked very diligently under her aunt directions but her diligence and her silence concealed i very absent anxious mind 
and about noon the made her escape with her work to the em room that the might have no concern in another and at the deemed it most unnecessary hearsay of the hint act which henry crawled viii just proposing delight at once of having her time to herself and of avoiding the light of mr ruthworth

what would your governess in your uncle lay to see them need for inch 10 purpose 
could sir than look in a n us just now he would bless himself for we are re eying ill over the home

i heard him 10 
i came and the theatre is engaged of counsel by those indefatigable rehe-nen agatha and frederick 
if they are not perfect i ball be surprised

well is i could by whispering to him a we shall have an excellent agatha there is something no autumn 
in her manner 10 completely animal in her voice countemuoe.’ was not that well done of me 
he brightened up directly 
now for my soliloquy 
she n and fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which the idea of representing demand visit to strongly calculated to inspire 
but with looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of a man 
with such an annual however miss crawled had courage enough 
and they had got through half the scene when a tap at the door brought i pause and the entrance of edward the next moment suspended it all 
surprise consciousness and pleasure appeared in each of the three on this unexpected meeting 
and as edward was come on the very name business that had brought minx crawled connioumeu and pleasure were likely to be more than momentary in them 
he too had his book and wan seeking fanny to ask her to repeated with him and help him to prepare for the evening without knowing mus afford to be in the home 
and great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown together of comparison schemes and say 
baptizing in praise of fanny kin offices 
so could not equal them in their warmth 
her spirits sank under the glow of theirs and she felt herself becoming too nearly nothing to both to have any comfort in having been sought by either 
they must now hearse together 
edward proposed ur entreated it till the lady not very unwilling at rest mansfield park 
1778 could renew no longer and fanny was wanted only to prompt and observed them 
she wan invented indeed with the office of judge and critic and eagerly desired to exercise it and tell them all their faults 
but from doing to every feeling within her think 
she could not de not dared not 
after r. it had she been otherwise qualified for criticism er conscience must have remained her from venturing at dilapprohotion 
she believed herself to feel too much of it in the aggravate or honesty or safety in particular 
to prompt them must be enough for her 
and it was sometimes more than enough 
for the could not always pay attention to the book 
in watching them she forgot herself 
and agitated by the increasing spirit of edmund'a manner had once closed the page and turned away exactly ii he wanted help 
it wan imparted to very enviable weariness and the war thanked and pitied 
hut else deserved their pity more than she hoped they would ever ennui t lasts the scene won over and fanny forced herself to odd her niece to the compliment each wan ring the other 
and when again alone and able to real the whole the was inclined to believe their performance would indeed have such nature and feeling in it an malt ensure their credit and make it a very altering exhibition to herself 
whatever i hat he he effect however the mun thud the brut o it again that very day
