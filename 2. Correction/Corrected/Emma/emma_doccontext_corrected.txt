was almost afraid you would be hurrying home 
he contrived that she should he untied by him 
and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best backed apple for her and trying to make her help or advise him in his work till jane fairest was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again 
hint she was not immediately ready edmund did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves 
she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough he to touch it without emotion 
she must reason herself into the power of performance 
and emma could not but pity such feelings whatever their origin and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again 
at last jane began and though the first bars were fanny given the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to 
my westons had been delighted before and was delighted again 
emma joined her in all her praise 
and the pianoforte with every proper discrimination pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise 
whatever colonel campbell might employ 1 said frank church with a smile at emma 6 the pen has not chosen ill 
i heard a good deal of colonel campbell taste at weymouth 
and the softness of the upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and all fall part would particularly prize 
i dare say miss fairest that he either gave his friend very minute directions or wrote to broadwood himself 
do not you think so 
no jane did not look round 
she was not obliged to hear 
mrs westons had been speaking to her at the same moment 
a his not fair 1 said emma in a whisper 
umpire was a random guess 
do not distress her mind 
3 heuhmkhhhadwithamﬂgandlookednifhe had very little doubt and very little mercy 
soon after he began again 
a how much your friend in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on thin occasion miss fairest 
i dare say they often think of you and wonder which will be the day the precious day of the inttmment’e coming to hand 
do you in me colonel campbell knows the bueinustobegoing rwardjmtatthinimel do you imagine it to he the consequence of immediate commission from him or hint he may have lent only a general direction an order indefinite a to emma depend upon contingenciu and conveniences 
4 he passed 
she could not but hear 
the could not avoid sauntering 
a till i have a longer from colonel campbell 1 laid the in a voice of forced calmness 1 i can imagine nothing with any confidence 
it must be all conjecture 
a conjecture 
aye sometimes one conjecture right and sometimes one conjectures wrong 
with i could conjecture how soon i shall make this river quite warm 
what nonsense one talks miss woodhcnue when hard at work if one talk at all 
your real workmen i suppose hold their tongues 
but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word 
miss fairest laid something about conjecturing 
there it it done 
i have the pleasure madam to mr dates of restoring your rpectaclee heated for the present 
he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter 
wear a little from the latter he went to the pianoforte and begged miss fairest who was still sitting at it to play something more 
a if you are very kind 1 said he a it will be one of the waste we danced last night 
let me live them over again 
you did not enjoy them at i did you a red tired the whole time 
i believe you were 3 we 4 man 
danced no longer 
but i would have given worlds 
all the world one ever hat to give 
for another half-hour 
she played 
a hat felicity it in to hear a tune again which bad made one happy 1 his mistake not thatwudanced at weymouth 
she looked up at him for a moment coloured deeply and played something else 
he took some music from a i shall near the pianoforte and turning to emma 33 1 here is something quite new to me 
do you know it 
cramped 
and here are a new set of il‘lll'l memories 
that from such a quarter one might expect 
this wan all sent with the instrument 
very thoughtful of colonel campbell was not it 
he knew miss fairest could have no music here 
i honour that part of the attention particularly 
it shows to have been so thoroughly earn the heart 
nothing hastily done nothing complete 
this attraction on my could have prompted it emma wished he would be less pointed yet could not help being amused 
and when on glancing her eye towards jane fair the caught the remains of a smile 
when the law that with all the deep blush of consciousness there had been a smile of secret delight the had lee scruple in the amusement and much less compunction with respect to her 
this amiable upright perfect jane fairest was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings 
he brought all the music to her and they looked it over together 
emma took the opportunity of whist rug 
favour speaks too plain 
she must understand is i hope she does 
i would have her understand me 
i m not in the least ashamed of my meaning clump 
5 but really i am half ashamed and wish i had never taken up the dear a i am very glad you did and that you communicated to me 
have nowakeytoall her odd looks and ways 
leave shame to her 
if the done wrong she ought to feel it 
a she is not entirely without it i think i do not lee much sign of it 
she is playing 1 robbing affair a at thin moments

shortly afterwards mill hates planning near the window descried mr nightly on horseback not far off

a well i am no sorry 
oh mr nightly what a delightful party last night 
how extremely pleasantly did you ever lee such dancing 
was not it delightful 
miss woodhouae and mr frank church 
i never saw anything equal to it a oh very delightful indeed 
i can lay nothing less for i suppose in woodhoute and mr frank mass 7 church are hearing everything that passes 
and raising his voice still more i do not see why miss airs should not be mentioned too 
i think miss fairest dances very well 
and mrs westons is the very best country-dance player without exception in england 
now if your friends have any gratitude they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return 
but i can not my to hear it 
oh mr nightly one moment more 
something of consequence 
so shocked 
jane and i are both to shocked about the apples 
7 a what is the matter now 
7 a to think of your sending us all your store apples 
you aid you had a great many and now have not one left 
we really are so shocked 
mrs hodges may well be angry 
william hawkins mentioned it here 
you should not have done it indeed you should not 
ah he is off 
he never can hear sobs thanked 
but i thought he would bane staid now and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned 
well returning to the room i have not been able to succeed 
mr nightly can not stop 
he is going to kingsweston 
he asked me if he could do anything 
a yes a mind jane we heard his kind offers 
we heard everything 
a oh yes my dear i dare say you might 
because you know the door was open and the window was open and mr nightly spoke loud 
you most have heard anything to be sure 
can i do anything for at kingsweston 2 said he 
so i mentioned 
oh m woods must you be going 
you seem but just come 
is very obliging of you 
emma found it really time to be at home 
the visit had and lasted long 
and on examining watches so much of the morning was perceived to be gone that mrs easton and her companion taking leave also 8 em could allow themselves only to walk with the young ladies to hatfield gate before they let off for scandal 
charms it 
t may be possible to do without dancing entirely 
instances have been known of young people in many 
many months successively without g at any ball of any description and no material injury accrue either to body or mind 
but when a beginning is 
made 
when the felicity of rapid motion have once been though slightly felt 
it must be a very heavy net that does not ask for more 
f rank church had danced once at highly and longed to dance again 
and the last half-hour of an evening which mr woodhoure was persuaded to sped with his daughter at random war penned by the two young pen e in schemes on the subject 
frankly war the first i and his the greatest zeal in using it 
for the lady was the best judge of the dirt courtier and the most solicitous for accommodation and a penance 
but till she had inclination enough for shewing pen 12 again how delightfully mr frank church and in warehouse danced 
for doing that in which the need not blush to compare herself with jane fairest 
and even for simple dancing itself without any of the wicked aid of vanity 
to such him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold 
— and then in taking the dimenqu of the other parlour in the hope of discovering in spite of all that mr westons could my of their exactly equal size that it war a little the largest 
his first son and request that the dance begun at mr cot sun should be wished there 
that the sum 
9 nine party should be collected and the arm musician enraged 
met with the readiest acquiescence 
mr eton entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment and mr westons most willingly undertook to play long they could wish to dance 
and the inserting employment had followed of reckoning up exactly who there would be and mentioning out the inn unable division of c. to every leg 
dryer and misa‘sriiiath and maria will be three and the two miss course have had been repeated many time over 
and there will be the two gilberts young coax my father and myself beside 
mr nightly 
yes that will be quite enough for pleasure 
you and nice smith and in fairest will three and the two miss coaxed ives and for live could let there will be plenty of rooms at soon it came to be on one ride 
but will there be good room for five couple i 
i really do not think there will on another 
a and after all live couple are not enough to make it worth while to nod up 
five couple are nothing when one thinks seriously about it 
t will not do to invite live couple it can be allowable only as the thought of the moment 
somebody said that sir gilberts wan expected at her brothers and must be invited with threat 
somebody clue believed mr gilberts would have danced the thatevening minehead been asked 
a word was put in foraoecond young coax 
and at last mr westons naming one family of caution who must be included and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out it became a certainty that the five couple would be at lent ten and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be of 
the doors of the two room were just opposite each so emma 
other 
might not they use both room and dance acre thence 
a it ueernedthehenacheme 
and it was not in good but that many of them wanted a tear 
emma laid it would be awkward 
my season was in dimness about the upper 
and mr woodhouae opposed it eagerly on the score of health 
it made him to very unhappy indeed that it could not 
be persevered in 
oh no a rapid be it would he the extreme of imprudence 
i could not bear it for error 
— 
emma is not strong 
she would catch a dreadful cold 
so would poor little harriet 
so you would all 
my want you would be quite laid up 
do not let them talk of such a wild thing 
pray do not let them talk of it 
that young nor speaking lower in very thoughtful 
do not tell his father but that young man in not quite the thing 
he has been opening the door very often till 
evening 
and keeping them open v inconsiderately 
he does not think of the daughter 
with not mean to 3 map again 
him but indeed he in not quite the in -5 a western was sorry for each a charge 
she knew the importance of it and laid everything in her power to do it away 
every door was now'cloaed the passage plan given up and the first scheme of dancing only in the room there in resorted to again 
and with such goodwill on frank churchill’s part that the place which a saunter of an hour before had been deemed barely cheat for ever on e was now endeavoured to he made out quite enough or ten 
a we were too am a chest aid he 
a we allowed unnecessary room 
ten couple may stand here very we 
emma debarred 
it would be a crowd 
a and crowd 
and what could alone than dancing without space to turn in 2 1 emma 
l l iv true 4 he very red 
a it very bad 
but idellyhe went on and still he ended with 
i think there will he very tolerable room for ten couple 5 no no laid she you are quite unreasonable 
it would he dreadful to be staring no close 
nothing can be farther from pleasure than to dancing in a crowd 
and a crowd in little room here is no denying it he is agree with on exactly 
a crowd in a little more 
miss woocﬁ-oule you have the art of giving picture 
in a few words 
exquisite quite exquisite still however having proceeded so far one in unwilling to give the matter up 
it would be a disappointment to my father 
and altogether 
do not know that 
i are uglier of opinion that ten couple might stand here very w 1 emma 
give that the nature of his gallantry wan a little eyes filled and that he would rather suppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her 
but the look the compliment and gave the rest 
had she intended ever to mar 
him it might have been worth while to pause and consider and try to understand the value of preference and the character of his temper 
but for all the purposes of their acquaintance he was quite unable enough 
before the middle of the next day he was at hatfield 
and he entered with inch an agreeable mile as cried the continuance of the scheme 
it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement 
a well miss woodhouue 4 he almoelimmediately began 1 our inclination for dancing has not been quite for ten away i hope by the terror of my father lit e room i bring a new proof on the subject a thought of my father's which wait 
only your approach 2 ha 
action to be acted upon 
ma ihopeforthehononr of your hand for the two first capes of this little projected ball to be given not at rascally but at the crown inn 2 1 6 the crown l a yes 
if you and mr warehouse see no objection and i trust you can not my father his friends will be so kind as to visit him there 
m accommodations he can promise them and not a less grateful welcome than at rascally 
it is his own idea 
mrs westons sees no objection to it moved you are satisfied 
this is what we all feel 
ah you were perfectly right 
ten couple in either of the randalls’ rooms would have been lumﬁ‘emble 
dreadfully i felt how right you were the whole time but was too anxious for securing anything to like to yield 
is not it a exchange 
you consent 
i hope you consent 
its tomeaplandiatnobodycanobjectm if mr and mr westons do not 
i think it admirable 
and as far as i can answer for myself shall be most happy 
it seems the only improvement that could be 
papa do you not think it an excellent improvement 2 1 
she was obliged to report and next lain it before it was fully comprehended 
and then in quite new further representations were near to make it acceptable 
no 
he thought it very far from an improvement 
a very bad plan 
much worse than the other 
a room at an inn was always damp and dangerous never properly aspired or it to be inhabited 
if they must dance they had better dance at random 
he had never been in the room at the crown in his life 
did not know the e who kept it by sight 
oh no 
a very bad plan 
hey would catch worse colds at the crown than anywhere emma 
x 3 1 l was going to observe sir said frank church a that one of the great recommendations of this change would he the very little danger of anybody catching cold 
so much less danger at the crown than at handles 
mr parry might have reason to regret the alteration but nobodvyvelse cot 
sir a said mr oodhonse rather warmly 1 you are very much animate if on oppose mr poetry to be that sort of character 
mr army is extremely concerned when any of us are ill 
but i do not understand how the room at the crown can he alter for you than your father's house 8 from the very circumstance of its being larger sir 
we shall have no occasion to open the windows at all 
not once the whole evening 
and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows letting in cold air upon heated bodies which as you well know sir do the mischief 
a open the windows 
but surely mr churehill nobody would think of opening the windows at rascally 
nobody could be no imprudent 
i never heard of such a thing 
dancing with open windows i i am sure neither your father nor mrs westons poor miss taylor that was would matter it a ah l sir 
but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window-curtains and throw up a sash without its being suspected 
i love often known it done myself a have you indeed sir 
bless me 
i never could have supposed it 
but i live out of the world and am often astonished at what i hear 
however this does makeadiﬂerenee 
mdperhapgwhenwecome totally it over 
but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration 
one can not resolve upon them in a hurry 
if mr and mrs westons will be so obligingly as no call here one morning we may talk it over and see what can he done h. b 14 em 
a but unfortunately sir my time it so limited 
oh 1 emma there will be plenty of time for talking everything over 
there is no hurry at all 
if it can he contrived to he at the crown papa it will he very convenient for the house 
they will he so near their own table so they will my dear 
that in i great thing not that james ever complaint 
but it is right to spare our horse when we an 
if i could be sure of the room being thought sized 
but in mrs stroke to he hunted 
i doubt it 
i do not know her even by i hat 
go can answer for everything of that nature 1 became it will be under my tenant care 
on terms undertakes to direct the while a there past i now you must he attended 
our own dear my station who in mrefulneu itself 
do not you remember what mr pop laid is many year ago when i had the release 
a f main taylor undertaken to what miss emma it you need not have any part 
first how often have heard you speak of it as each a compliment to her 
a aye very true mr party did ray to 
i shall never forget it 
poor little emma 
you were very bad with the release 
that in 
you would have been very had but for parrys great attention 
he came four times a day for a week 
he aid from the list it me a very good tart 
which wan our great comfort 
but the measures are a dreadful complain hope whenever 1 isabella s little one have the measure he will tend or parry my father and mr westons are at the crown at thin moment a aid frank church examining the capabilities of the house 
i left them there and came on to hzrtﬁeld impatient for your opinion and hoping you might he persuaded to join them and give‘yaur emma 
15 adviceonthespot 
iwasdeu'redtouyeofmmhoth 
it would he the greatest pleasure to them if you could allow me to attend you there 
they can do nothing satisfactorily without you 
emma was most happy to be called to such a council and her father engaging to think it all over while she was gone the two young leg set off to either without delay for the crown 
rest were s and mrs westons 
delighted to see her and receive her approbation very busy and very happy in their different way she in some little distress 
and he ending everything real pay emma a said the 1 this paper is worse than i expected 
look 
in places you see it is dreadfully dirty and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than anything i could have imagined a my dear you are too particular 1 said her husband 
a what does all that signify 
you will see nothing of it by candlelight 
it will he as clean as rascally by candlelight 
we never see anything of it on our clubnights 
the ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant 1 men never know when things are dirty or not 
a and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself a women will have their little nonsense and needless cares one perplexity however arose which the gentlemen did not disdain it regarded a supper-room 
at the time of the hall 
room s being built supper had not been in question 
and a small card-room adjoining was the only addition 
what was to be done 
his card-room would he wanted as a card-room now 
or if cards were conveniently vowed unnecessary by their four selves still was it not too small for any comfortable supper 
another roof much better size might be secured forthepurpose 
butitwuat theotherendol' 16 emma 
the home and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it 
this made a difficulty 
mrs westons was afraid of thought for the young pen lie in that passage 
and neither emma nor the pen men could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at so per 
mrs westons proposed having no regular supper 
merely sandwich c. set out in the little room 
but that was tainted at a wretched suggestion 
a private dance without sitting down to supper was pronounced an infamous frauds upon the risk of men and women 
and mrs westons must not speak of it again 
she then took another line of expediency and looking into the doubtful room observed 
i donotthink it i so veryunall 
well not be many on now and s lessons at the tame time walking briskly with long steps through the go was calling out 
a you talk a great deal the length of thin passage my dear 
it is a mere nothing after all 
and not the least brought from the stairs i with said mr westons one could know which arrangement our gum in general would like hen 
to do what would he most generally pleasing must be our object 
if one could but tell what that would be 
a yes very true a cried frank very true 
you want your neighbour opinions 
i do not wonder at you 
if one could ascertain what the chief of them 
the sofa for infancy they are not far off 
shall i call upon them 
miss hates 
she still nearer 
— and i do not know whether in bartlett in not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rent of the people as anybody 
i think we do want a larger council 
suppose i go and invite miss hates to join us 
a sum 17 
well 
if please said mr westons rather hesitating 
a if 
a think she will be of any use 4 you will get nothing to the purpose from miss hates 1 said emma 
she will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing 
she will not even listen to your questions 
i see no advantage in complying miss hates 
but she is so amusing no exterior amusing 
i am very fond hearing miss hates talk 
and i need not bring the whole family you know 
here mr westons joined them and on hating what was proposed gave it his decided probao'oo 
a aye do frank 
go and f miss gates and let us end the matter at once 
she will enjoy the scheme assure 
and do not know properer son for showing on how to do away difficulties 
ah miss hates 
we are owing a little too nice 
she is a standing lesson how to be happy 
but fetch them both 
invite them both 
a both sir 
a can the old lady s the old lady 
no the young lady to he sure 
i shall think you a great blockhead frank if you bring the aunt without the niece 
oh 
i beg your pardon sir 
i did not immediately recollect 
undoubtedly if you wish it i will endeavour to persuade them both and away he ran 
long before he appeared attending the short neat brisk-moving aunt and her elegant niece 
mrs westons like a sweet-tempered woman and a good wife had examined the passage again and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before 
indeed very trifling 
and here ended the difficulties of decision 
all the rest in speculation at least was perfectly smooth 
all the minor arrangements of table and chair lights and music tea and supper made themselves

frank had already ye written to entoombe to propose saying a few day beyond hit fortnight which could not be refused 
and a delightful dance it was to be 
most cordially when mile hates arrived did the agree that it must 
as a counsellor the was not wanted 
but at an appear a much safer character the was truly welcome 
her approbation at once general and minute warm and incessant could not but please 
and for another half-hour they were all walking to and from between the different rooms come up in some attending 
and all in happy enjoyment the future 
the party did not break it without

that 1 right 
i knew he would i 
hum 1810 net thing only wan wanting to make the prospect of the hall completely satisfactory to emma its being fixed for a day within the granted term of frank churchill'a my in sorry 
for in spite of mr westons confidence the could not think it to very improbable that the church might not allow their s new to remain a day beyond his fortnight 
but this war not judged feasible 
the preparations must take their time nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on and for a few days they must be lasting proceeding and hoping in uncertainty at the risk 
in her opinion the great risk 
of its being all in vain

great you in fact if nothing word

butitwaanot allwasug and prosperity 
and an the removal of one solicitude generally make 
way for another emma being new certain of her ball began to adopt an the next vexation mr knightley’l provoking indiﬂ'ereme about 
either became he did not dance himself or became the plan had been formed without his being consulted he seemed resolved that it should not interest him determined against its exciting any pull curiosity or affording him any future amusement 
to her voluntary communications emma could t no more approving reply than 
— a very well 
i the westons think it worth while to he at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment i have nothing to lay again it but that they shall not chuse plans for name 
oh yes 
i nine be there 
i conldnotreﬁue 
still keep much awake an i can 
but i would rather be at home looking over william larkina’a week's account 
much rather i confess 
please in seeing dancing l 
not i indeed never look at it 
i do not know who does 
— fine dancing i believe like virtue must be in own reward 
those who are morning by are equally thinking of something very different this emma felt was aimed at her 
and it made her quite angry 
it wan not in compliment to jane fairest however hint he w an indifferent or in indignant 
he was not 
guided by her feelings in nyrobating the ball for be on yet the thought of it to no extraordinary degree 
i made her animated 
open-hearted 
she voluntarily rid 
a oh 
miss woodhouee i hope nothing may happen to event the ball 
what a diuppoinuuent it would he 
i do look forward to it i own with very great pleasure 
20 em a it was not to oblige jane fairest therefore that he would have preferred the society of william hawkins 
no l 
she was more and more convinced that mr venison was the mistaken in that surmise 
there war a great case of friendly and of campus-innate attachment on his tide 
but no love 
alas 
there wan noon no leisure for quarrelling with mr nightly 
two day of security were immediately followed by the overthrow of everything 
a letter arrived from mr church to urge his nephew instant return 
mr church was unwell 
fartoounwell todowithout him 
she had been in a very suffering state is said her head when writing to her nephew two day before though round her usual unwillingness to give gain and constant habit of never thinking of herself the had not mentioned it 
but now the was too ill to trifle and must entreat him to set all for combe without delay 
the substance of thin letter was forwarded to emma in a note from mr westons intently 
a to hit going it was inevitable 
he must be gone within a few hours though without feeling an real alarm or hit aunt to learn his me dance 
idle knew her illness 
they never occurred rut for her own convenience 
mrs westons add a that he could only allow herself time to hurry to highly 
after breakfast and cake leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him 
and that he might be expected at hatfield very soon this wretched note was the small of emma breakfast 
when once it had been read there was no doing anything but lament and exclaim 
the loss of the ball 
the loss of the young man 
and all that the young man might feeling 
it were too wretched 
such a delightful evening at it would have been 
everybody so happy 
and the and her partner the happiest 
— -5 i said it would he or was the only consolation 
in 
21 her father's feeling s were quite distinct 
he thought principally of my hurtful a illness and wanted to know how she wan treated 
and as for the hall it we shocking to have dear emma disappointed 
but they would all be safer at home 
emma was ready for her visitor borne time before he appeared 
but if this repeated at all upon his impatience hill iorl'owfnl look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him 
he felt the going away almost too much to speak of it 
his dejection was most evident 
he sat really lost in thought for the em few minutes 
and when rousing himself it was only 8 
a f all horrid things leave-taking is the worst but you will come again a said emma 
this will not be your only visit to rascally 
a ah l 
shaking his head 
the uncertainty when i may be less to much 
i shall try for it with a zeal 
it will be the fall my thought and care l 
and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring 
but i am afraid 
— they did not stir last spring 
i am afraid it is a custom gone for ever a our poor ball must be quite up 
ah 
that ball l 
why did we wait for anything 
why not seize the plunged at once 
— 
how often is happiness destroyed by put on foolish reparation 
— you told us it won 1 ago 
— 
oh 
is wood house why are you always so right 9 
a indeed i am very sorry to be right in this instance 
i would much rather have been merry than wise 7 a if i can come again we are still to have our ball 
my father depends on it 
do not forget your engagement 
emma looked graciously 
7 a such a fortnight as it has been 
4 he continued 
every day more precious and more delightful than the 8 i sha 
day before 
every day making me less lit to bear any other place 
happy those who can remain at hrghbury 
a an you do us such ample justice now a said emma laughing i will venture to ask whether you did not come a little doubtful a hat 
do not we rather surpass your expectations 
i am sure we do 
i am cure you did not much expect to like i 
you would not have been no long in coming if you bid had a pleasant days of higher 
he laughed rather curiously 
and though denying the sentiment emma was convinced that it had been an 
a and you must be of this very morning 
a 
yes 
my fatheristojoin me here walls walk back together and i must be off immediately 
i am almost afraid that every moment will bring him a not have minute to spare even for your friends mill fair and miss pales 
how unlucky 3 map yates's powerful argumentative mind might have strengthened ours 
yes my 
just line called there 
paling the door i thought it better 
it was a right thing to do 
i went in for three minutes and was detained miss ball being absent 
she was out 
and felt it impossible not to wait till she came in 
she is a woman that one may that one man laugh at 
but that one would not with to slight 
it was better to pay my visit then 4 he hesitated got up walked to a window 
2 in than said he perhaps miss warehouse 
i think you can hardly be quite without suspicion 4 he looked at her as if wanting to read her thoughts 
she hardly knew what to lay 
it seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely action which she did not with 
forcing herself to speak 
therefore in the hope of putting it by the calmly laid 
inn 
23 “youarequiteindreright 
it was calm about visit then a e was silent 
she believed he was looking at her 
probably reflecting on what she had laid and trying to understand the manner 
she hard him sigh 
it was natural for him to feel that he had me to sigh 
he could not believe her to be encouraging him 
a few awkward moment passed and he not down again 
and in a more determined manner aid 
— “itwunomedringwfeelthatallthereltofmy time might be given in hatfield 
my regard for hatfield is most warm 
4 he so t again rose again and leaned quite embarrassed e wan more in love with her than emma had so 
and who can say how it might have ended his father had not made his appearance 
mr woodhouae won followed 
and the necessity of exertion made him a very few minutes more however completed the present trial 
mr were always alert when heroine was to he done and an incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable m of foreseeing any that was doubtful said a it was time to go 
and the young man though he might and did sigh could not but agree and rise to take leave 
i shall hear about you all a said he 
that is my chief consolation 
i shall hear of that in going on among you 
i have engaged red ear to correspond with me 
she has been to kind as to raise it 
oh 
the blessing of a female correspond eat when one is really interested in the meal 
she will tell me anything 
in her letters i shall be at dear higher a not a very friendly shake of the hand a very east good-bye 1 closed the speech and the door had soon shut out frank church 
short had been the 14 em 
notice 
charms their meeting 
he was gone 
and emma felt so sorry to part and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry and feeling it too much 
it was a and change 
they had been meeting almost every day since his arrival 
certainly his being at rascally had given great spirit to the last two weeks 
indescribable spirit 
the idea the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought the assurance of his attentions his liveliness his manners 
it had been a very happy fortnight and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common tone of heartfelt days 
to complete every other recommendation he had aylmers 
told her that he loved her 
what strength or what constancy of affection he might be subject to was another point 
but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration a conscious preference of herself 
and this persuasion joined to all the rest made her think that she must 
be a little in love with him in spite of every previous determination against it 
i certainly must a it she 
his sanction of littleness weariness stupidity thin disinclination to lit down and employ merely this feeling of everything being dull and insipid about the house 
1 must be in love 
i should be the oddest creature in the world if i were not 
for a few weeks at let 
well evil to some is always good to others 
i shall have many fellow-mournen for the ball if not for frank church 
but mr nightly will be happy 
he may spend the evening with his dear william hawkins now if he likes mr knit tilney however showed no triumphant happiness 
age could not say that he was sorry on his own account 
his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had 
but he said and very readily usual 
5 that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others and with considerable kindness added 
— you emma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really out of luck 
you are very much out of luck 
a it was some days before she saw jane fair to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change 
but when they did meet her composure was odious 
she had been particularly unwell however suffering from headache to a degree which made her aunt declare that had the hall taken place she did not think jane could have attended it 
and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill-health 
chair in 
mrs continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love 
her ideas only varied as to the how much 
at first she thought it was a good deal 
and afterwards but little 
she had great pleasure in hearing frank church talked of 
and for his sake greater pleasure than ever in seeing mr and mrs westons 
she was very often thinking of him and quite impatient for a letter that she might know how he was how were his spirits how was his aunt and what was the chance of his coming to rascally again this spring 
but on the other hand she could not admit herself to he unhappy nor after the first morning to he less i for em enjoyment than usual 
the was still busy and cheerful 
and pleasing as he was she could yet imagine him to have fag 27 
and farther though thinking of him so much and as she sat drawing or working forming a thousand amusing schemes for the page 
and close of their attachment fancying interesting dialogue and into 26 
venting elegant letters 
the conclusion of every inquiry declaration on his tide was that she refused him 
heir affection war always to abridge into friendship 
everything tender and charming was to mark their parting 
but till they were to part 
when he became sensible of this it struck her that the could not he very much in love 
for in spite of her prior and fixed determination never to quit her father never to marry a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than ill could foresee in her own feelings 
a i do not and myself making any one of the word roofs 1 said the 
2 in not one of all my clever replies my delicate negative in there any allusion to making a sacrifice 
i do suspect that he to not really necessary to my happiness 
so much the better 
i certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than i do 
i am quite enough in love 
i should be sorry to he more upon the whole the was equally contented with her view of his 
feeling 
oh in undoubtedly very much in love 
everything denote it 
very much in love indeed 
and when he comes again if his infection continue i must be on my guard not to encourage it 
it would he most inexcusable to do otherwise as my own mind in quite rude up 
not that i imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto 
no 
if he had believed me at all to share his feeling he would not have been i wretched 
could he have thought himself encouraged his look 
and language at parting would have been different 
still however i must be on my guard 
thin in in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now ll 
or i do not know that i expect it will 
i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man 
i do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy 
his feeling are warm but i can imagine them rather changeable 
tom 
i 17 every coul'dcntion ofthenihjecginehrxumkeeme thankful that my happiness in not more deeply involved

it war a long well written letter giving the of his 
journey and of his feelings expressing all the affection and respect which was natural and honourable and describing everything exterior and local that could he opposed attractive with spirit and no nourishes now of apology or concern 
it was the language of real feeling towards mr westons 
and the transition from highly to enocornhe the contrast between the place in some of the list hle-‘uge official life was just enough touched on to show how keenly it war felt how much moremighthave been but for the marianne of propriety 
the charm of her own name was not wanting

and in the very last time of in meeting her e unpardoned as it war by any such broad reach of gold try all yet could dim the effect of her influence and know e the great compliment orphan of all conveyed 
spread into the very owed vacant corner were these words i had not a red moment on tuesday as you know for miss oodhouae’e beautiful little friend 
pray make my excuses and adieu to her thin emma could not doubt wan all for herself harriet am remembered 18 sum 
only from being her friend 
his information and profess to combe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated 
my chill am recovering and he dared not yet even in his own imagination x a time for coming to recall again 
gratifying however and nirnulative as was the letter in the material part its sentiments she yet found when it was folded up and returned to my lesson that it had not added any lasting warmth 
that she could all do without the writer and that he must learn to do without her 
her intentions were unchanged 
her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness 
his recollection of harriet and the words which clothed it 
the a beautiful little friend 
suggested to her the idea of harriet succeeding her in his affections 
was it impossible -5 
no 
harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding 
but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner 
and all the probabilities of circumstance and connection were in her favour 
for harriet it would be advantageous and delightful indeed 
a i must not dwell upon it a said she 
a i must not think of it 
i know the danger of indulging such speculations 
but stranger things have happened 
and when we cease to care for each other as we do now it will be the means of conforming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which i can already look forward to with pleasure it was well to have a comfort in store on harriet behalf though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom 
for evil in that quarter was at hand 
as frank churchill’s arrival had succeeded mr almost engagement in the conversation of highly as the latest interest had entirely born down the first so now evila 
-5 upon frank church s disappearance mr eton concerns were assuming the most inetiiu'ble form 
his wedding-day was named 
he would soon be among them again 
mr easton and pride 
there'wal hardly tame to talk over the em letter from combe before a mr easton and his bride was in everybody's mouth and frank church wan forgotten 
emma grew sick at the sound 
she had had three week's happy reception from mr eton 
and han-let'mrnd ill 
had been willing to hope had been lately gaining strength 
with 1 weawn’c ball in view at lent there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things 
but it me now too evident that the lad not 
attained such a state of composure an could stand against the actual approach 
new carriage bell-ringing and 
poor harriet was in a matter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothing and attention even kind that emma could give 
emma felt that he so not do too much for her that harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience 
but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without prose using any effect 
for ever agreed to without being able to make their opinion the lame 
anxiety listened submissive and said it was very true 
it was a miss oodlwune described 
it was not worth while to think about them 
and the would not think about them any longer but no change of subject could avail and the next half-hour saw her an anxious and miles about the elation as before 
at last emma attacked her on another ground 
your allowing yourself to be an occupied and so unhappy about mr eton marrying harriet is the amongst reproach you can make no 
you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into 
t wan all my doing i know 
i have not forgotten it ii 
c 30 em 
i assure you 
deceived myself i did very miserably deceive you 
and it will be a painful reflections to me for ever 
do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it 
harriet felt thin too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation 
emma continued 
i have not aid exert yourself hurried for my take 
think less talk less of mr eton for my sake 
because for your own sake rather i would wish it to be done for the take of what in more important than my comfort 
a habit of self-command in you a consideration of what in your duty an attention to propriety an endeavour to avoid the suspicion of others to save your health and credit and restore your tranquillity 
these are the motives which i have been pausing on you 
they are very important and sorry i am that you cannoti feel them sufficiently to act upon them 
my being moved from pain in a very secondary consideration 
i want you to save yourself from greater pain 
perhaps i may sometimes have felt that harriet would not forget what was due 
or rather what would be kind by me this appeal to her affections did more than all the met 
the idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for miss warehouse whom she really loved extremely made her wretched for a while 
and when the violence of grief wan comforted away still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably 
a you who have been the best friend i ever had in my life 
want gratitude to you l 
nobody is equal to you 
i care for nobody an i do for you 
oh miss woodhouae how ungrateful i have been 
a such expressions assisted as they were by everything that look and manner could do made emma feel that she had never loved harriet so well nor valued her affection so highly before 
7/7/41 sam «wi/w’zﬂ‘m ma 
a 31 there itnothing equal to tenderness of heart a it she afterwards to herself 
there is nothing be compared to it 
warmth and tenderness of heart with an affectionate open manner will but all the clearness of head in the world for attraction i am sure it will 
it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so really beloved 
which gives isabella all her poultry 
i have it not 
but i know how to prize and it 
harriet my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives 
dear harriet 
— i would not change you 11 the clearesvphaded longest-sighted betty judging female breathing 
oh the boldness of a jane relax 
harriet is worth a hundred such and for a wife 
a sensible man's wilcox 
this invaluable 
i mention no names 
but happy the man who changes emma for harriet 
a charms it 
mrs clifton was em seen at church but though devotion might be interrupted curiosity could not be raised by a bride in a pew and it must left for the visits in form which were then to be paid to settle whether she were very pretty indeed or only rather return or not rest at all 
emma had rings less a curiosity than of pride or propriety to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects and she made a point of harriet going with her that the worst of the business might he gone through as soon a possible 
she could not enter the house again could not he in the lame room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago to lace up her boots without recollecting 
a thousand vexatious thoughts would secure 
compliments shared and horrible 32 man 
blunders 
and it was not to be supposed that poor harriet should not be recollecting too 
but the behaved very well and was only rather pale and silent 
the visit was of court short 
and there wan to much embarrassment and occupy tone of mind to character it that emma would not as now himself entirely to form an opinion of the lady and on no account to give one beyond the nothing-meaning terms of being a elegantly dressed and very pleasing she did not by like her 
she would not be in a hurry to and fault but the suspected that there wm no elegance 
— ease but not elegance 
she was almost sure that for a young woman a stranger a bride there war too much ease 
her person was all good 
her face not pretty 
but neither feature nor air nor voice nor manner were elegant 
emma thought at lent it would turn out to 
air for mr eton his manners did not appear 
— but no she would not permit a beauty or a witty word from herself about his manners 
it wan an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits 
and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it 
the woman wan better of the might have the guidance of fine clothes 
and the privilege of baahﬁrlneu 
but the man had only hit own good sense to depend on and when the considered how peculiarly an ugly poor mr clifton was in being in the me room at once with the woman he had just married the woman he had wanted to marry and the woman whom he had been expected to marry the most allow him have the right to look a little wine and to be at much affectedly and as little really any as could be 
a well miss woodhouac 1 said harriet when they had quitted the house and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin 
well miss woodhouee 4 with a gentle sigh that do you think of her 
in not the very charming i m 33 there was a little hesitation in emma answer 
oh l yet 
very 
a very pleasing sang woman 
a i think her beautiful quiz beast 
a very nicely dressed indeed 
a remarkably elegant gown 
a i am not at all nil-prized that he should have fallen in love 
oh 
no 
there is nothingtonrprize one still 
a pretty fortune and she came in his way i dare yes a returned harriet dashing again a i dare say she was very much attached to him a perhaps she might 
but it is not every means fate to marry the woman who loves him best 
miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home and thought this the best offer she was likely to have 
yes a and harriet ready a and well she might 
nobody could ever law a better 
well i wish them happy with all m heart 
and now miss warehouse i do not think shall mind seeing them again 
he is just as superior as ever 
but being married know it is quite a different thing 
i indeed miss woodhonse you need not be afraid 
i can sit and admire him now without any great misery 
to know that he has not thrown himself away is such a comfort 
she does seem a charming young woman just what he deserves 
happy creature 
is called her a au a how delighted 
a hen the visit was returned emma made up her mind 
she could then see more and judge better 
me harriet happening not to be at hatfield and her father being present to engage mr eton she had a quarter of an hour of the lady s conversation to herself and could composedly attend to her 
and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that mr clifton was a vain woman extremely well satisfied with herself and thinking much of her own importance 
that she 34 1 
nun 
meant to shine and be very superior but with manner which had even formed in a had school 
pert and familiar 
that all her notions were drawn from one net of people and one style of living 
that if not foolish she was ignorant and that her society would certainly do mr eton no good 
harriet would have been a better match 
if not wise or resigned herself she would have connected him with those who were 
but miss asking it might be fairly supposed from her early consent had been the best of her own set 
the rich brother-in-law near brighton was the pride of the alliance and his place and his carriages were the pride of him 
the very list subject after being seated was able grove a brother mr suekling’s seat 
7 a comparison of myself to make grove 
the grounds of replied were small but neat and pretty 
and the house wan modern and well-spelt 
mr eton seemed most favourably impressed by else size of the room the entrance and all that she could see or imagine 
a very like male grove indeed 
she wan quite struck by the likeness l 
that room was the very shape and size of the dining-room at male grove 
her sisters favourite room mr clifton was appealed to 
a way not it astonishingly like 
— she could really almost fancy herself 2 male grove 
and the staircase 
— you know as i came in i observed how very like the staircase wan 
placed exactly in the same part of the home 
i really could not help exclaiming i assure you miss warehouse it in very delightful to me to he reminded of a place i am no extremely partial to as able grove 
i have spent so many happy month there 
4 with a little sign of sentiment 
7 a charming place undoubtedly 
everybody who sees it is struck by its beauty 
but to me it has been quite a home 
whenever you are transemma 
i 35 planted like me miss woodhume you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with anything at all like what one has left behind 
i always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony 
emma made as slight a reply as she could 
but it was fully sufficient for mrs easton who only wanted to be talking herself 
a so extremely like male grove 
and it is not merely the house 
the grounds i assure you as far as i could observe are strikingly like 
the lands at male grove are in the lame profusion as here and and very much in the same way 
just across the lawn 
and 1 had a glimpse of a one large tree with a bench round it which put me so exactly in mind 
my brother and sister will be enchanted with this place 
people who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with anything in the arts style emma doubted the truth of this sentiment 
she had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of anybody else 
but it was not worth while to attack an error so dmible-dyed and therefore only said in reply 
a when you have seen more of this count i am afraid you will think you have overrated i‘l’artﬁeld 
sorry is full of beauties 
a oh 
yes i am quite aware of that 
it is the garden of england you know sorry is the garden of england a yes 
but we must not rest our claims on that distinction 
many counties i believe are called the garden of england as well as sorry no i fancy not replied mrs clifton with a most satisfied smile 
i never heard any county but surely called so emma was silenced 
a my brother and sister have promised us a visit in 36 emma 
the spring or summer at farthest continued mrs easton 
and that will be our time for exploring 
whiletheyarewithmweshallex loreagreatdeal l dare say 
they will have their mnche-landau of counter which hold four perfectly 
and therefore without saying anything of our carriage we should be able to vex lose the different beauties extremely well 
they won hardly come in their chaise i think at that season of the year 
indeed when the time draws on i i shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouchelandau 
it will be so very much preferable 
when people come into a beautiful country of thin sort you know miss woodhouae one naturally wishes them to ice as much aspouible 
after sparkling is extremely fond of exploring 
we exposed to king’i-wetton twice last manner in that way most delightfully just after their first having the barouche 
sunday 
you have many parties of that kind here i suppose in warehouse every summer 2 
a no 
not immediately here 
we are rather out of distance of the very striking beautiewhich attract the sort of pantries you speak of 
and we are a very quiet set of people i believe 
more to stay at home than engage in schemes of lea-are.” ah 
there is nothing ire staying at home for real comfort 
nobody can he more devoted to home than i am 
i was quite a proverb or it at ma leg grove 
many a time has eliza said when she has going to bristol 1 really can not get thin girl to move from the house 
i absolutely most go in by myself though i hate being stuck up in the bamuchblandau without a companion but augusta i believe with her own good will would never sir beyond the park paling many a time has she laid so 
and yet i am no advocate for entire seclusion 
i think on the contrary when people shut themselves up entirely from society it is a very bad nun 
37 thin 
and that it in much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree without living in it either too much or too little 
perfectly understand your situation 
however in woodhouae” looking toward mr woodhouae your father case of health must be a great drawback 
why does not he try bath i 
indeed he should 
let me recommend bath to you 
i you l have no doubt of its long mr woodhonre a my father tried it more than once formerly but without receiving any benefit 
and mr parry whose name i dare say in not unknown to you does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful how ah 
that's a great pity 
foriauure youmr woodhouae where the water do agree it is quite wonderful the relief give 
in my bath life i have ten such instances of it 
and it in so cheerfulaplace that it could not fail of being of use to mr woodhoune’a spirits which i understand are sometime much depressed 
and as to its recommendation 
to join i fancy i need not take much pain to dwell on them 
the advantages of 18th to the g are general understood 
it would be aycohinrming inaction for you who have lived so secluded a life and i could immediately cure you some of the best modesty in the place 
a line from me would bring you a little boast of acquaintance 
and my particular friend my marriage the lid 1 have always resided with when in bath would most happy to show you any attention and would be the very person for you to go into public with 
a it was in much an emma could bear without being impolitic 
the idea of her being indebted to mr eton for what was called an invitation 
of her going into public under the ample of a friend of my 38 runs 
elinor 
probably house vulgar dashing widow who with the helps borders just made a shift to live 
the dignity of miss warehouse of heartfelt was sunk indeed 
she restrained herself however from any of the reproofs she could have given and only thanked mrs easton coolly 
a but their going to bath was quite out of the question 
and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father and then to prevent further courage and indignation changed the subject directly 
i do not ask whether you are musical mrs easton 
upon these occasions a lady character generally precede her 
and higher has long known that you are a superior performer 
oh 
no indeed 
i must protest against any such idea 
a superior performed 
very far from it i assure you consider from how partial a quarter your information made 
i am doatingly fond of music 
— passionately fond 
and my friends say i am not entirely devoid of taste 
but as to anything else upon my honour my performance is 
odious to the last degree 
you miss warehouse i well know play delightfully 
i assure you ithasbeen the greatest satisfaction comfort and delight to me to hear what a musical society i am got into 
i absolutely can not do without music 
it is a necessary of life to me 
and having always been used to a very musical society both at male grove and in bath it would have been a most serious sacrifice 
i honestly said as much to mr e. when he was speaking of my future home and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable 
and the inferiority of the house too 
knowing what i had been accustomed to 
of course he was not wholly without apprehension 
when he was speaking of it in that way i honestly said that to world i could give up 
parties balls plays emma 
39 
for i had no fear of retirement 
blessed with so many resources within myself the word was not necessary to no 
i could do very well without it 
to those who had no resources it was a different thing 
but my resources made me quite independent 
and as tosmaller-sizedroomsthm ihadheenusedto really could not give it a thought 
i ho i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description 
certainly had been accustomed to every luxury at male grove 
but i did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to m happiness nor were serious a tenth 
a but a said i a to be quite honest do not ask i can live without something of a musical society 
i condition for nothing else 
but without music life would be a blank to me a a we can not suppose said emma smiling 
that mr ellison would hesitate to assure you of there being very musical society in higher and i hope you will not and he has outstripped the truth more than may be pardoned in consideration of the motives 
no indeed i have no doubts at all on that head 
i am delighted to and myself in such a circle i hope we shall have many sweet little concerns together 
i think miss warehouse you and i must establish a musical club and have regular weekly meetings at your house or ours 
will not the good plan 
i we exert ourselves i think we shall not be long in want of allies 
something of that nature would be particularly desirable for m as an inducement to keep me in practice 
for married women you know 
there is a sad story against them in general 
they are but too apt to give up music 5 but you who are so extremely fond of it 
there can be no danger surely

eliza has entirely to a nun 
given up music 
— never touched the instrument though theplayedlweetl

c carriage that was 
and of the two lane now my bred and on james cowper 
and of more than i can enumeration 
upon my word it it enough to put one in a fright 
i used to be quite an ray with eliza 
but really i begin now to comprehend that a married woman ha many things call her attention 
i believe i win half an hour thin morning shut up with my housekeeper 5 but everything of that kind 1 said emma 
will eoonbeinsoregularatrain 7 a well 1 said my eton laughing 3 we shall ascend emma sending her so determined upon neglecting her music had nothing more to lay 
and after a moment's pause mrs easton chose another subject 
a we have been calling at anhalt a said she a and found them both at home 
and very pleasant place they seem to be 
i like them extremely 
mr began seems an excellent creature 
quite a first-rate favourite with me already i assure you 
and -5 appears to truly good 
there in nothing to motherly and kind-hearted about her that it wine upon one directly 
— 
sure was your governess i think 
emma was almost too much astonished to answer 
but mr eton hardly waited for the nﬂimmtive before the went on 
having understood at much i war rather astonished to find her so very alike 
but the is really quite the gentlewoman a mr westons manners a aid emma a were always particularly good 
their propriety rum laity and elegance would make them the safest ran l for any young woman a and who do you think tame in while we were there 2

emma was quite at a lost 
the tone implied some old acquaintance and how could she boldly easy a knight l a continued mrs easton 
— a nightly himself 
as not it luck 2 for not being within when he called the other s i had never seen him before 
and of course a so particular a friend of mr as i had a great curiosity 
a my friend nightly had been so often mentioned that i was really impatient to see him 
and i must do year upon the justicetosay that he need not be ashamed of his friend 
nightly is quite the gentleman 
i like him very much 
decidedly i think a very gentlemanlike nun 
ha ill itwasnow time to be no 
they were of angrl‘gmma could breathe 
go by insufferable woman 
was her immediate exclamation 
worse than i had supposed 
absolutely insufferable 
nightly 
i could not have believed it 
nightly 
never seen him in her life before and call him kuightleyl and discover that he is a gentleman 
a little upstart vulgar being with heerandhermra of andherresouroes and all her airs of pert pretensions and endeared energy 
actually to discover that mr nightly is a gentleman 
i doubt whether will return the compliment and discover her to be a lady 
i could not have believed it 
and to put that she and i should unite to form a musical pug 
one would fancy we were bosom friends and mr westons 
astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman 
worse and worse 
i never met with her equal 
much beyond my hopes 
harriet is disgraced 
any comparison 
oh 
what would frank church say to her if he were here 
how angry and how driver he would be 
ah 
there i am thinking of him directly 
always the first person to be thought 43 urn 
of 
how i larch myself out 
frank church corner at regularly into my mind 
l 
all this ran no gladly through her thought that by the time her father had arranged himself after the bustle of the elliot departure and w ready to speak the was very tolerably capable of attending 
well my dear 4 he deliberately began 1 considering we never saw her before the seem a very pretty sort of young lady 
and i dare eat she was very much pleased with you 
she speak a style too quick 
a little quickness of voice there is which rather hum the ear 
but i believe i am nice 
do not like strange voices 
and nobody speak like you and poor miss taylor 
however the seem a ve obliging prettybehaved young lady and no doubt will make him a very good wig 
though i think he had better not have married 
i made the best excuse 
i could for not having been able to wait on him and mr eton on this happy occasion 
i laid that i hoped i built 
in the course of the summer 
but i ought to have gone before 
not to wait upon a bride is very remiss 
ah i it shows what a and invalid i am 
but i do not like the corner into image lane 8 i dare lay your apologies were accepted air 
mr eton know your eyes 
but a young lady 
a bride 
i ought to have paid my respect to her if‘pouible 
it was being very deficient 
a but my dear papa you are no friend to matrimony 
and therefore why should you be no anxious to pay your respect to a bride 
it ought to be no recommendation to you 
it is encouraging people to marry if you make no much of them a no my dear i never encouraged anybody to marry but would always to pay every proper attention to a lady 
and a bride especially ll never to us 
43 be neglected more is avowedly duets bars 
a bride you know my dear is always the first in company let the others be who they yet a well papa if thin is not encouragement to marry i do not know what in 
and i should never have vexed you to be lending your sanction to inch vanity for poor young ladies a my dear you do not understand me 
this is a matter of mere common politeness and good-breeding and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry 
emma had done 
her father was growing nervous and could not understand bars 
her mind returned to mrs westons offences and long very long did they occupy her 
chasm in 
mrs wan not required by any so urgent discovery to retract her ill opinion of us eton 
her observation had been pretty correct 
such as mrs easton appeared to her on this second interview such she appeared whenever they met again self 
important presuming familiar ignorant and ill-bred 
she had a little beauty and a little accord listen but so little judgment that she thought herald just coming with superior knowledge of the world to enliven and in move a country neighbourhood 
and conceived main akin to have held such a place in society as mrs westons consequence only so d surpass 
there was no reason to suppose mr eton thought at all differently from his wife 
he deserved not merely happy with her but proud 
he had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to highly as not even miss woodhoune could equal 
44 man 
and the greater part of her new acquaintance akin to commend or not in the habit of judging following the lead of mibatee’t good-will or taking it for granted that the bride mounted an clever and at agreeable at she professed himself were very well entitled 
to that my eton praise parted from one month to another at it ought to do unimpaired by mile woodhouee who readily condemned her sins contribution and talked with a good grace of her being very pleasant and very elegantly dressed 
in one respect mrs easton grew even worse than the had appeared at first 
her feeling altered toward emma 
offended probably by the little encouragement which her proposal of intimacy met with she drew back in her turn and gradually ye beauties much more cold and distant 
and though the effect was agreeable the ill-will which produced it waneceﬂarily increasing emma dislike 
her manners too 
and mr almost 
very unpleasant towards harriet 
they were appearing and negligent 
emma hoped it must rapidly work harriet cure 
but the relation which could prompt allall behaviour sunk them both v much 
it was not to be doubted that poor janet i attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve and her own there in the story under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most nothing to him had in all likelihood been given also 
she was of course the best of their joint dislike 
when they had nothing else to lay it must be always easy to begin abusing main woodhouoe 
and the anxiety which they dared not how in open disrespect her found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of harriet 
my eton took a great fancy to jane fairest 
and from the first 
not merely when a state of margaret with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other but from the very rum 
and the was not 26 45 tinged with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration but without solicitation or plea or trivial the must he want to artist and friend her 
game emma had for erred her confidence and about the third time of their meeting she heard all my eton knighterlamry on the object 
jane fair to absolutely charming ire woodhousc 
i quite have about jane fairest 
a sweet interesting creature 
so mild and alike 
and with such talent 
— i assure you i think she very extraordinary uses 
i do not scruple to say that she played extremely well 
i know enough of music to speak decided on that it 
oh 
sheioahoolubely charming 
on will laugh at my warmth but put my word i talk of nothing but jane fairest 
and her situation in so calculated to affect one l 
miss woodhoune we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her 
we must bring forward 
such talent as here must not he suffered to remain unknown 
i darcy you have hard those charming lines of the poet 
“fnllmallyaﬂowe‘rlalwmto hlnahnnaeen and wanted in kingham on the desert fire we must not allow them to be vexed in meet jane fairfax.” i can not think there is any danger of it a was emma calm answer 
and when you are better acquainted with mine fairfax'n duration and undereumdwhather homes been with cleveland on campbell i have no idea that you will support her talents can be unknown 
oh 
but dear miss woodhouee the in now in such retirement such obscurity 30 thrown away 
whatever advantage she may have enjoyed with the campbell are palpably at an end 
and i think she felt 
i am surely does she verytirnid and ii 
d 46 ma 
insolent 
one can see that the feel the want of encouragement 
likeherthebetkrforit i must confess it recommendation to me 
i am a great advocate for utility 
and i am sure one does not often meet with it 
but in thought are at all inferior it is extremely repoueou'ng 
he 
i assure on one fair very delightful character and interest me more than i can x a you appear to feel a deal but i am not aware how you or any of fairfax’u acquaintance here an of those who have known her longer than yourself can allow her any other attention than 
a my dear miss woodhouae a vast deal may be done by herwho dare to act 
you and i neednotheafraid 
if we let the example many will follow it up for as they can 
though all have not our situation 
we have carriages to fetch conveyed home 
and we live in a style which could not make the addition of jane fairest at any time the lean inconvenient 
i should be extremely displeased if wight were to send us up such a dinner an could make we regret having asked more than jane fair to partake of it 
i have no idea i that none of thing 
it in not likely that i could considering what i have been used to 
my greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite the other way in doing too much and being too careless of expense 
make grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be 
for we do not at all affect to equal my brother mr smoking in income 
however to resolution it taken an to noticing jane fairest 
i certainly have her very often at my home half introduce her wherever i can all have musical parties to draw out her talents and shall he only on the watch for an eligible situation 
m acquaintance in no very extensive that i have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly 
i shall introduce her of man 
47 course very particularly to my brother and sister when theycornetous 
iameuretheywilllikeherextremer 5 and when the get a little acquainted with them her fears will completely wear all 
for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is i d conciliating 
i shall have her very often indeed while they are with me 
and i dare lay we dull sometimes and a seat forbear in the hnrouche-landan in come of our exploring parties 
poor jane fairest 
thought emma a you have not deserved this 
you may have done wrong with regard to mr diction 
but this in a punishment beyond what you can have merited 
the kindness and protection of mrs easton 
— a jane fair and jane fairest 
a heaven 
let me not suppose that the day go about emma woodhouseing me 
but upon my honour there seem no limits to the licentiousness of that woman tongue 
a emma had not to listen to such puddings again 
to any so exclusively addressed to herself 
to disgusting lay departed with a a dear miss woodhouse.” he change on mrs westons aside soon afterward appeared and she vine left in peace 
either forced to he the very particular friend of mrs clifton nor under my eton a guidance the very active pan-onesof jane fair and only sharing with others in a general way in knowing what was felt what was educated what was done 
she looked on with some amusement 
miss hates gratitude for mrs eton attentions to jane was in the hot steps of less simplicity and warmth 
she was nice one her worries 
the most amiable anne delighted woman 
just an accomplished and condescension as my eton man to he considered 
emma on my surprise was that jane fairest should accept those attentions and solemn mr eton an the seemed to do 
she heard of her walking with the westons sting 48 main 
with the extent ependingaday with the tone 
this wan atwoixhingl she could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of mine fairest could endure such society and hardship an the village had to offer 
v she is a ridge quite a idle a raised the 
a to chuse to remain here month after month under private of every sort 
and now to chuses the mortification of my elinor notice and the penury of her conversation rather than man to the superior companion who have always loved her with such real generous affection 
jane had come to highly professedly for three months 
the campbell were gone to ireland for three month 
but now the can i had promised their daughter to my at least till summer and fresh invitation had arrived for her to them there 
acre coming to miss hates 
it all came from her 
mr diction had written most pressingly 
would jane but go means were to he found tenants sent friends contrived 
no travelling difficulty allowed to exist 
but till the had declined it 
she must have home motive more were than a for repining thin invitation a wan mama conclusion 
a she must 
be under some sort of penance inflicted either by the campbell or pencil there in t fear t caution t resolution somewhere 
go in no 
gillieahe with thegmzism 
the decree in imputed by somebody 
but why must the content to he with the elation 
here is quite a separate puzzle upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the mr t before the few who knew her opinion of my eton man was ventured thin apology for jane 
we can not more that she has an great enjoyment at the village my dear emma at it ll better runs 
49 than being always at 
home 
her aunt is a good creature 
but as a constant companion must be very tiresome 
we must consider what miss fairest run before we condemn her taste for what she goes to a you are right mrs woodston a aid mr nightly warmly 
miss fairest is as capable as any of us of forming a opinion of mrs eton 
could she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have chosen her 
but 
with reproachful smile at emma a she receives attentions from mrs eton which nobody else pay her 
emma felt that mrs westons was giving her a momentary glance and she was herself struck c 
his warmth 
with a faint blush she presently replies 
a such attentions as mrs westons i should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify miss fairest 
mrs westons invitations i should have imagined anything but inviting 
a i should not wonder 1 said mrs westons 
if miss fairest were to live been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunt eagerness in accepting mrs westons civilities for her 
poor miss hates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a 
greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in spite of the very natural wish of a little change both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again 
and after a few minutes silence he said 
a another thing must be taken into consideration too 
mrs eton does not talk to as fair as she speaks of her 
we all know the difference between the honours he or she and thou the fairest spoken amongst us 
we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other 
a something more early imparted 
we can not give anybody the disagreeable hints that we may 50 man 
have been very full of the hour before 
we feel thing deemed 
and besides the operation of thin as a general principle youhad he one that miss fairest awe 
my eton by her superiority both of mind and 
manner 
and that face to face in eton treat her with allthererpectwhichlhehu a claim 
such woman a jane fairest probably never fell in my eton way before 
and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comymtive little in action if not in con-ciounneu.” 8 i know how highly you think of june fairest a rapid emma 
little henry wan in her thoughts and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her absolute what else to us 
a yet 4 he replied 1 anybody my know how highly i think of her 
and yet said emma beginning hastily and with an arch look but soon stopping 
it was better however to know the want at once 
be hurried on a and yet perhaps you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it in 
the extent of your admiration may take you by raise some day or other 
mr nightly wan hard at work upon the lower bottom of him thick feather gates and either the exertion of getting them together or some other cause brought the colour into hit face at he answered 
oh 
are you there but you are miserably behindhand 
miracle gave me a hint of six weeks ago he opposed 
emma felt her foot printed by mr easton and did not herself know what to think 
in a moment he went on 
a that will never be however i can assure you 
mill fair i dare my would not have me if i were to ask her 
and i am very sure i dull never ask her emma returned her friend prepared with interest 
and was pleased enough to exclaim 
xlvi

you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way if you were married mr nightly was thoughtful again 
the remains of his reverie wanted no emma i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprise 
i never had a thought her in that way i assure you a and soon afterwards jane fairly in a way charming young woman 
but not even jane fairly in perfect

i told him he wan mistaken 
he asked my pardon and said no more 
castle does not want to be wiser or sister than his neighbours 
in that respect how unlike dear mrs easton who wants to be wiser and sister than all the world 
i wonder how she speak of the cooks 
what she called snug 
them 
how can die and any application for them deep enough in familiar vulgarity 
she call you rightly 
what can she do for mr coze 
and no i am not to he that jane fairest acre try her civilities and 
consent to he with her 
my fasten your argument weight roof with me 
i can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss ayethat i can believing the triumph of mine fairfax’a mind over my eton 
i have no faith in mrs eton acknowledging herself the inferior in thought word or deed 
or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good breeding 
i can not imagine that the will not be continually inviting her visitor with praise encouragement and offers of service 
that the will not be continually detailing her magnificent intention from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful erring parties which to take place in the barouche l joy jane fairest has feeling a said mr knights

her aenaihiiitiea i suspect are rang and her temper excellent in in power of forcing patience self-control 
but it want openness 
she a renewed

no 
till coze alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head 
i saw jane fair and conversed with her with admiration and pleasure always 
but with no thought beyond a well my were said emma triumphantly when he left them what do you say now to mr 1 knightley’l marrying jane f airs

43 chasm 37 
everybody in and about highly who had ever visited mr clifton was to pay him attention on his marriage 
dinner parties and evening parties were made dr him and hit lady 
and invitations bowed in so fast that the had noon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged doze 
a see hnw1trs wishes 
l leewhatahfe i am to lead among 
upon my word we dull he absolutely dissipation e really seem quite the fashion 
if this is living in the country it is nothing very amiable 
from monday next to saturday i assure you we have not a disengaged day 
a woman with fewer resources than i hue need not have been at a loan no invitation was amiss to her 
her bath habit 
made evening parties perfectly natural to her and make grove had given her a taste for disarm she was a little shocked at the want of two drawing-rooms at the poor attempt at minutes and there being no ice in the higher card-parties 
my baker mr party on guard and they were a good deal behindhand in knowledge of the world but -5 would won show them how everything ought to he named 
in the course of the spring the must return their civilities by one very superior party 
in which her card-tables should he get out with their separate candles and unbroken paces in the true style and more waiters sang for the evening than their own establishment could wish to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour and in the proper order 
emma in the meanwhile could not be satisfied without a dinner at hatfield for the westons 
they must not do less than others or she should be exposed 44 man 
to odious sons and imagined capable of wilful renenmenln‘pa dinner there must be 
after man had talked about it for ten minutes mr warehouse felt no unwilling and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him 
the persons to be invited required little thought 
besides the else it must he the custom and mr medley 
so far it was all of course and it was you inevitable that poor little harriet must he asked to make the eighth 
but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction and on many accounts emma wan particularly pleased by harriet begging to be allowed to decline it 
a she would rather not be in by company more than she could help 
she was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together without feeling uncomfortable 
if miss warehouse would not be dispersed the would rather stay at home 
it was precisely what emma would have wished had she deemed it possible enough for within 
she was delighted with the fortitude of her little bend 
for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home 
and she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth jane fairest 
since her an conversation with many weeks and mr knight she was more conuknwuﬁckm about jane fair than she had often been 
mr knightley’e words dwelt with her 
he had said that jane fairest received attentions from mrs eton which nobody else her 
this is very true a said the east leastasfaras relates to me which was all that was meant and it i 
very shameful 
of the lame age and always knowing her i ought to have been more her friend 
she will never like me now 
i have neglected her too long 
emma 
i 35 but i will allow her greater attention than i have done 
every invitation was successful 
i'i‘hey were all disengaged and all happy 
the preparatory interest of this dinner however wan not yet over 
a circumstance rather unlucky occurred 
the two eldest little knights more engaged to pay their grand pale and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring and thin papa now pray bringing them and saying one whole day at his old 
which one would the very d of this party 
his profession engagements did not a low of but being put off but both father and daughter were disarmed by its happening on 
mr warehouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear 
and here would be a ninth 
and emma apprehended that it would be a ninthvery much out of humour at not being able to come even to parted for forty 
eight hour without falling in with a dinner party 
she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself by representing that though he certainly would make them nine yet he always said no little that the income of noise would be ere material 
she thought it in reality a and exchange 1 herself to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother 
the event wan more favourable to mr woodhouoe' than to emma 
john nightly came 
but mr westons was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day 
he might he able to in them in the evening but certainly not to dinner 
is woodhoule was quite at ease 
and the seeing him to with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate removed the chief of even emma vexation 
the day came the party were purely assembled 36 rum 
and mr john nightly learned early to devote herself to the business of being agreeable 
instead of drawing his brother of to a window while they waited for dinner he was talking to miss fairest 
mrs eton elegant us lace and part could make her he looked at in silence 
writing only to observe enough for lnbella’u information 
but may fairly wan an old acquaintance and a quiet girl and he could talk to her 
head met her before befall us he was returning from a walk with his little boys when it had been just beginning to rain 
i we natural to have some civil hoped on the subject and he paid 
i hope you did not venture far in fairest thin morning or i am sure you must have been war 
we scarcely got home in time 
i hope you turned directly a i went only to the pont-oﬂice 1 said she and reached home before the rain we much 
it in my daily errand 
i always fetch the letter when i am here 
i have trouble and in a something in get me out 
a walk before breakfast does me good 
not a walk in the rain i should imagine 
no 
but it did not absolutely rain when i set out 
mr john nightly smiled and replied 
that is to say you choose to have your walk for you were not fix yards from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you 
and henry and john had seen more drop 
than they could count long before 
the post-olice ha a great charm a one period of our lives 
when you have lived to my age you will begin to drink letter are never worth going through the rain for 
there was a little blush and then thin answer 
i must nozhopetobe ever situated yours in the midst of every dearest 
connection and therefore i is 
37 can not expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters 
indiﬂ'el’ent 
oh no 
i never conceived you could become indifferent 
m letters are no matters of indifference 
they are l a ve five curse 
7 a you are kinggsfmletteyrs of 
mine are letters of friends i 
a i have often thought them the worst of the two 1 replied he coolly 
a business you know may bring money but friendship hardly ever goes a ah 
your not serious now 
i know mr john knight too well 
i am very sure he understands the value friendship as well as anybody 
i can easily believe that letters are very little to you much i than to me 
but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference 
it is not age but situation 
you have every dearest to you always at hand i probably never she again 
and therefore till i have outlived all my affections a post-cilia i think must always have power to draw me out in worse weather than to-day a when i talked of altered hire by the proof fears a d john nights i meant to me change of situation which time shall brings 
i consider one as including thither 
time generally lessen the interest 
of every attachment not within the daily circle 
but that is not the change i harding view for you 
as an old friend you will allow me to hope miss fix that ten years hence you may have as many concentrating object as i have 
it was kindly said and very far from giving offense 
a pleasant 
thank you seemed meant to laugh it off 
but blush a quivering lip a tear in the eye showed that it was felt beyond a laugh 
her attention was now claimed by mr woodhonsei who being according to his custom on such occasions uniting the circle emma

6 the whole party were but re-assembled in the drawing-room when mr westons made his appearance among them 
he had returned on a lamp dinner and walkedtoi-lartheldu noon as it over 
he had been too much expected by thenbut judges for nor-prize 
but there was great mr woodhouae wan almost a glad to see him now as he would have been sorry to one him before 
john nightly only was in mite astonishment that a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of bodies in london who d set off again and walk half miles another man house for take of being in mixed company till bedtime of finishing his day in the effort of civility and the noise of numbers was a circumstance to strike him d lay 
a man who had been in motion since eight or rock in the morning and might now sure been still 
who had been long talking and might have been silent 
— 
who had been in more than one crowd and might have been alone l 
such a man to sit the tranquillity and independence of hit own ii e and on the evening of a cold already april day rushed out again into the world l 
could he by a touch of his anger have instantly taken back his wife there would have been a motive 
but his coming would probably along rather than break up the party 
john knight looked at him with amazement then shrugged his shoulders and aid 1 i could not harm believed it even of three mr westons manhe perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting happy and cheerful a maria and with all the right of being principal talker which a day t anywhere from home confer wan making him agreeable among the rest 
and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife an to his dinner convincing her that none of all her careful direction 
to the 8 rum 
servant had been forgotten and supper abroad what public news he had heard we proceeding to a family communication which though principal addressed to mrs westons he had not the allens aught play being highly interesting to everybody in the room 
e we her a letter 
it 31 from milk and m herself 
maria met with it in hit way and had taken the liberty of opening it 
a read it read it a laid hear it will give yonplealure 
only few linen 
will not make young 
read it to emma the two ladies looked over it together 
and he at smiling and talking to them the whole time in a voice a little subdued but very audible to everybody 
a well he in coming you see 
good news i think 
well what do you say to it 
i always told you he would be here again won did not i 
anne my dear did not i always tell you to and you would not believe me 
in town next week you need the latest i dare my 
for -5 it an impatient an the black gentleman when anything in to be done 
most likely they will be there to-morrow or saturday 
as to her illness all nothing of course 
but it it an excellent thing to have frank among us again 30 near at town 
they will an a good while when they do come and he will be ha his time with us 
this in precisely what i wanted 
well pretty good news ll not it 
have you finished it 
a emma read it all 
put it up put it up 
we will have a good talk about it some other time but it will not do now 
i shall only just mention the circumltanoewtheotbeninacommonwa 
my westons was most comforts by please on the occasion 
her such and words had nothing to remain them 
she wan happy she knew the was happy and knew she ought to be happy 
her longest sons were warm and open 
but emma could not speak no emma 
-5 fluently 
she was a little occupied in we g her own feelings and trying to understand the great of her agitation which side rather thought was considerable 
mr wrong however too eager to be very observant too communicated to want other to talk 
was very well entitled with what ll did any and soon moved away to make the rest of his friend happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already 
it was well that he took everybody's for granted or he might not have thought either mr oodhouee or mr knew they particularly delighted 
they were the list entail end after mr 
woodston and emma to he made happy 
from them he would have proceeded to mite fairest 
but she was no deep in conversation with john nightly that it would have been too positive an interruption 
and finding himself chose to mr easton and her attention disengaged he necessarily began on the subject with her 
chapter ﬁﬁﬁ‘h 
hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you a said mr westons 
mrs eton very willing to expose a peculiar compliment intended her by such a hope arm red coat generously 
you have heard of a certain frank church i presume he continued 
and know him to be my not though he does not bear my name 
7 a oh yes and i shall be v happy in his acquaintance 
i am are mr westons will lose no time in calling on him 
and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage.” you must 
a you are very obliging 
frank will be extremely happyglammre 
heistobein town next week if not owner 
we have notice of it in a letter to-day 
i met the letter in my way this morning and feeling my son hand pressed to open it though it m not directed to me it wan to mr westons 
she in hit principal component i assure you 
i hardly ever get a better and no you absolutely i d what wan directed to her of mr bench 
delighting affectedly 8 i must protest against that 
a most dangerous present indeed 
i be you will not let your neighbour 
follow your lamp e. upon my word if hill what i am to expect we married women must begin to exert yourselves of mr wrong i could not have believed it of you 
7 a aye we men are and fellow 
you must take are of yourself mr eton 
this letter tells m 
it it a short letter written in a hurry merely to give on notice 
— 
it tell that they are all coming up to town directly on my churchill’s account 
she has not been well the whole winter and thinks enacombetoo cold for her 
no they are all to move standard without loss of times a indeed 
from yorkshire i think 
welcome in in yorklhire i yes they are about 50 mile from london a considerable journey 
a year upon my word we considerable 
sixty-two mile farther than from map e grove to london 
but what is since mr westons to people of large fortune 
you would be amazed to hear how my brother mr seeking sometimes lies about 
you will hardly believe me but twice in one week he and mr bars went to london and back again with four home 
6 the evil of the distance from enocornbe said mr welcome in that mr church a we midland runs 
44 has not been able to leave the sofa for weeks together 
in f ankle last letter she complained he said of being too weak to get into her consolatory without having both his arm and his uncle 
this you know speaks a great degree of weakness 
but now she is impatient to be in town hint she means to sleep only two nights on the road 
so frank writes word 
certainly delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitution mr eton 
you must rant me that 
a no indeed i grant you nothing 
i always takes part ofwr‘lillyown sex 
i do indeed 
i give you notice you a and me a formidable antagonist on that point 
i always and up for women 
and i made you if you knew how belinda feels with me to sleeping at an inn you would not wonder at mrs churchill’s making incredible exertions to avoid it 
eliza says it is quite horror to her 
and i believe i have caught a little of her nicety 
she always travels with her own sheets 
an excellent precaution 
does mrs church do the name 
depend up it mrs church does everything that any other no lady ever did 
mrs church will not be second to lady in the land for a mrs eton eageaalrllyy interposed with 
a oh mr westons do not mistake me 
settling in no one lady i assure you 
do not run away with such an dear is not the 
then she is no rule for mr church who in as thorough a line lady as anybody ever beheld mr eton began to think she had been wrong in displaying no warmly 
it wan by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was no 
a one lady 
perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it 
and she was considering in what way she had best retract when mr westons went on 
2 mr 
a mrchurchill is not much in my good grace a 
you may am 
but this quite between ourselves 
she in very of frank and therefore i would not killofher 
besidegaheiloutofhealrh now 
but i indeed by her own account the hat always been 
i would not no to everybody mr eton 
but i have not much with in mr church i illness if she is really ill why not go to bath mr westons 
to bath or to clifton 
a shoe ha taken it into her head that eneoombe it too cold for her 
the fact is i suppose that the is tired of some 
she ha 
now been a longer time missionary there than the ever was before and she begin to want change 
it in a retired place 
a one place but very retired a aye like male grove i dare lay 
nothing can and more retired from the road than make grove 
such an immense plantation all round it 
you seem shut out from everything 
in the most complete retirement 
and mr church probably has not health or spirits like selfish to enjoy that sort of allusion 
or perhaps the may not have resources enough in herself to be qualities or a country life 
i always say a woman can not have too many munch-and i feel very thankful that i have so many myself at to be quite independent of society a frank war here in february for a fortnight v a so i remember to have heard 
he will and an addition to the society of higher when he come again 
that in if i may presume a 
call myself an addition 
but perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world this was too land a call for a complete to be passed by and mr reason with a very good grace immediately exclaimed 
my dear madam 
nobody but yourself could nun 48 is no such a thin blue 
not heard of 
i m weatoﬁ’mn lately have heenyailull of little else than mrs eton 
11 had done his duty and could return to his son 
when f rank left us a continued he it was quite uncertain when we might see him again which makes this day news doubly welcome 
it has been complete unexpected 
that is i always had a strong persuasion he would be 
here again soon 
i was sure something favourable would turn up 
but nobody believed me 
he and mrs westons were both dreadfully ending 
a how could he contrive to come 
and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again 30 and so forth 
i always felt that something would happen in our favour and so it has you see 
i have observed my ton in the course of my life that if things are going untoward one month they are sure to mend the next a very true mr westons perfectly true 
it is just what i used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship when because things did not quite right 
did not proceed with all the rapidity which united his feelings 
he was apt to he in d air and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be ma before hymen salmon robe would he put on for us 
oh 
the paint i have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views 
the carriage 
we had disappointments aboutnthe marriage 
one morning i remember he are to me quite in despair 
she wan stopped by a slight it of coughing and mr westons instantly seized the of vanity of going on 
a you were mentioning him 
may is the very month which mr church is ordered or has ordered herself to spend in some warmer place than ensemble 
— in short to spend in london 
so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring 
precisely the season of the year which 46 ma 
one should have chosen for it days almost at the longest weather girl and pleasant always inviting one out and never too hot for exercise 
when he was here before were the best of but tlmewaea good deal of wet damp cheerless weather 
there always in in february know 
and we could not do half that we in now will be the time 
thin will be complete enjoyment 
and i do not know my eton whether the uncertainty of our meetings the 14 of constant expectation there will be of his coming in today or tomorrow and at any mary not he more friend s to than having him actually in the house 
ithinltitinso 
ithinkitisthemteofmind which give most spirit and delight 
i hope you will bepleuedwithmyeon 
but youmustnotexpecta probity 
he is generally thought a one young man but do not expect a probity 
mrs westons partiality for him ll very great and on you may suppose most gratify ago to me 
she think nobody equal to him 
a and i assure you mr wrong i have we little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his mr 
i have heard so much in prize of mr frank church 
at the same me it is fair to observe that i am one of those who always judge for themselves and are by no means i lightly guided by other 
i give you notice that taller son to i thalljudgeofhirn 
i am no ﬂatterer.” mr westons wan making 
a i hope 1 laid he presently 
i love not been severe upon poor mrs church 
if she in ill i should be sorry told her injustice 
but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance 1 could wish 
you can not be ignorant man elation of my connection with the family nor of the treatment i have met with 
and between ourselves the whole blame of it is to he laid to her 
emma 
49 she was the instigator 
frank s mother would never have been slighted up the was but for her 
mr church has pride 
but his pride is nothing to his wife 
his is a quiet indolent gentleman-like sort of pride that would harm nobody and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome 
but her pride is arrogance and insolence 
and what incline one less to hear the has no air pretence of family or blood 
she was nobody when he married her barely the daughter of a gentleman 
but ever since her being turned into 1 church she has out-churchill’d them all in high and mighty claims 
but in herself i assure you she is an upstart 1 only think 
well that must be infinitely provoking up i have quite a honor of parts 
ma e grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort 
sir there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the aim the give themselves 
your description of mrs chasm made me think of them directly 
people of the name of human very lately settled there and encumbered with many low connections but giving themselves immense airs and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families 
a year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at west hall 
and how they got their fortune nobody know 
they came from birmingham which is not a place to promise much you know mr westons 
one has not great hopes from birmingham 
i always say there is something direful in the sound 
but nothing more is positively known of the turnings though a good many things i assure you are suspected 
and yet by their manner they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother mr seeking who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours 
it in infinitely too had 
mr seeking who has been eleven years a resident at male grove and whose father had it before him 
i believe 46 rum 
at lean 
i am almost sure that old mr seeking had worn feed the purchase before fill death hey were interrupted 
tea wan carrying round and mr westons having said all that he wanted soon took the opportunity of walking away 
after tea mr and mrs easton and mr eton eat down with mr woodhoune to earth 
the remaining five were left to their own powers and emma doubted their getting on very well 
for mr nightly seemed little disposed for convenau'on 
mr clifton was wanting notice which nobody had inclination to pay and the was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent 
mr john nightly proved more talkative than his brother 
he was to leave than early the next day 
and he soon began with 
a well emma i do not believe i have anything more to say about the boys 
but you have your sincere letter and everything in down at hill length there we may he tore 
my charge would be much more concise than here and probably not much in the same spirit 
all that i have to recommend being composed in 
— do not spoil them and do not price them 
i rather hope to satisfy you both 1 said emma 
a for i shall do all in my power to make them happy which will be enough for isabella 
and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physio.” 
and if you and them troublesome you must tend them home again a that it very likely 
you think no do not you 
7 a i hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your father 
or even my be come circumstance to you if your visiting engagement continue to increase at much as they have done lately 
a increase 
7 a certainly 
you must be sensible that the last 
hum 
47 half-year he made a game difference in your way of life 
a difference 
no indeed i am not a there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with come by than you used to be 
witness this very time 
ere am i come down for only one day and you are engaged with a dinner-party 
when did it happen before 
or anything like it 
your neighbourhood it increased and you mix more with it 
a idle while ago every other to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties 
dinner at mr colds or ball 
at the crown 
the difference which rascally rascally alone makes in your going on in very great 
yes a said his brother quickly a it in recall that does it all a very well 
and as rnndalls i suppose in not likely to have less influence than heretofore it make 
me an a possible thing emma that henry and john may be sometimes in the way 
and if they are i only beg you to lend them home 
a no a cried mr nightly 
a that need not be the consequence 
let them be sent to dwell 
i shall certainly be at leisure 
7 a no my wo 1 exclaimed emma you amuse me 
should like to know how many of all my numerous engagement take place v'lithnut your being of the party 
and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys 
these amazing engagements of mine 
what have they been 
dining once with the coldness and having a ball talked of which never took place 
i can understand a 
nodding at mr john nightly 
your good one in meeting with so many of your friends at once here delight you too much to pay unnoticed 
— but you turning to mr nightly who know how very very ii 
f must think they would 18 run 
seldom l 16 ever two hours from hatfield 
why you would foresee inch a series of dissipation for me 1 cannoti imagine 
and as to my dear little boys i must say that if aunt emma has not time for them i do let much better with uncle nightly who it absent from home about five hour 
when the ll insolent one 
end who when he ll at home it either reading to himself or letting his accounts mr nightly seemed to be trying not to mile 
and succeeded without difficulty upon mr eton beginning to all to him 
hum £55173 
very little quiet reflection wan enough to untidy emma up to the nature of her agitation on hearing his new of frank church 
she was soon convinced that 
it was not for herself the win feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed 
it was for him 
her own attachment had really whisked into a mere nothing 
it was not worth thinking of 
but if he who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he hid taken away it would he very distressing 
if a separation of two month should not have cooled him there were danger and evil 
before her caution for him and for herself would be necessary 
she did not mean to have her own affection entangled again and it would he incumbent on her to avoid any encourage of his 
she wished he might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration 
that would so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance 
and et the could not help rather anticipating something decisive 
she felt as if the ring would not without brings 
49 in a cross an event a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state 
it was not very long though rather longer than mr westons had foreseen before she had the power of forming some of union of frank churchill’s feelings 
the enscombc again were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined but he was at highly very soon afterwards 
he rode down for a couple of hours 
he could not i do more 
but 
as he came from rascally immediately to parted she could then exercise all her quick observation and speedily determine how he was influenced and how she must act 
they met with the utmost friendliness 
there could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her 
but she had an almost inmate doubt of his caring for her as he had done of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree 
she watched him well 
it was a clear thing he was has in love than he had been 
absence with the conviction probably of her indifference had produced this veﬁnatursl and very desirable object 
e was in high fruits 
as ready to talk and laugh as ever 
and ate delighted to speak of his former visit and return to old stories 
and he was not without agitation 
it was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference 
he was not calm 
his spirits were evidently muttered 
there was restlessness about him 
lively as he was it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself 
but what decided her belief on the subject was his staying only a quarter of an hour and hurrying away to make other calls in higher 
4 he had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed 
he had not stopped he would not stop for more than a word 
but he had the vanity to think they would be disappoint if he did not call 
and 
much as he wished to stay longer at parted he must hurry all 
so amuse 
shehadnodoubtutohisbeingkttinlovghit neither his agitated spirits nor his hurrying away seemed like a fact cure 
and she was rather inclined to think it up died a dread of her returning power and a discreet revolution of not trusting himself with her long this was the only visits from frank church in the court of ten days 
he was often groping intending to come 
but was always prevented 
it aunt could not bear to have him leave her 
such wan his own account at random 
if he were united sincere if he really tried to come it was to he in erred that my churchill’s removal to london had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder 
that she was really was very certain 
he had declared himself convinced of it at random 
though much might be fancy he could not doubt when he looked back that she was in a weaker of health than the had been half a year ago 
he did not believe it to proceed from anything that care and medicine might not remove or at least that the might not have many men of existence before her 
but he could not be prevailed on by all his father doubts to say that hercomplainu were merely imaginary or that the way at rung at ever 
it soon appeared that london war not the place for her 
she could not endure in noise 
her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering 
and by the ten days end her nephew letter to rascally communicated a change of plan 
they were going to remove immediately to richmond 
mr church had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there and had otherwise a fancy for the place 
a ready-furnished home in a favourite spot was engaged and much benefit expected from the change 
emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits this arrangement and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such urn 
or our neighbourhood to my dear friend 
for the house was taken for may and june 
she was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them almost an often as he could even wish 
emma 33 how mr westons understood the joyful prospects 
he was considering her an the source of all the happiest they offered 
she hoped it was not an 
two months must bring it to proof 
mr westons own happiness was indisputable 
he was quite delighted 
it was the very circumstance he could have wished for 
now it would be fully having blank in their neighbourhood 
what were nine miles to a young man 
— 
an hour ride 
he would be always coming over 
the difference in that respect of richmond and london was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never 
sixteen miles 
may eighteen 
it must be full eighteen to mancheeter street 
wan a sessions obstacle 
were he ever able to get away the day would be spent in coming and returning 
there was no comfort in having him in london 
he might as well be at combe 
but richmond was the very dances for easy intercourse 
better than nearer l one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal 
the ball at the crown 
it had not been forgotten before 
but it had been noon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day 
now however it was absolutely to be 
every pop soon returned 
and very noon after the charm ill had removed to richmond a few line from frank to any that his aunt felt already much better for the change and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four hours at any given time induced them to name as early a day an bled 
sly stone ball waste be a real thing 
a very few to-morrow stood between the young people of higher and happiness 
8 rum 
mr woodhouee was resigned 
the time of the year lightened the evil to hint 
may was better for everything than february 
my bath was engaged to spend the evening at hatfield 
james had due notice and he sanguine hoped that neither dear little henry nor 
dear little john would have anything the matter with them while dear emma were gone 
charm 217333 
i misfortune occurred again to prevent the hall 
they approached the day arrived 
and after a morning of some anxious watching frank church in all the certainty of his own self reached rascally before dinner 
and everything was safe 
no second meeting had there et been between him and emma 
the room at the town was to witness it 
but it would he better than a common meeting in a crowd 
mr westons had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her early attendance for hem-arriving there as soon at possible after themselves for the purpose of taking her opinion at to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before an other persons came that the could not refuse him an therefore must spend some quiet interval in the young man's company 
she was to convey harriet and they drove to the crown in good time the canal party just sufficiently before them 
frank church seemed to have been on the watch 
and though he did not say much his declared that he man to have a delightful evening 
they all walked about together to see that everything was as it should be 
and within a few minutes when joined the content of another carriage e which emma could not hear the sound of at first without great surprise 
so emma 
8 unreasonably early 
a she was going to exclaim 
but she presently found that it was a family of old friends you were coming like herself by particular desire to help mr woman s judgment 
and they were so very lately followed by another carriage of cousins who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness on the same errand that it seemed as if he the company might soon be collected together for the repose of preparatory inspection 
i may perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which mr westons depended and felt that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidante was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity 
she liked his open manners but a little less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher character 
— general benevolence but not general friendship made a man what he ought to he 
— he could fancy such a man 
the whole party walked about and looked and used again 
and then having nothing else to do formed a sort of half-circle round the are to observe in their various modes 
till other subjects were mind that though me a on in the evening was still very pleasant 
emma found that it was not mr westons fault that the number of privy counsellor was not yet larger 
they had stopped at mrs yates's door to offer the use of their carriage but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the westons 
frank was standing by her but not steadily 
there was a restlessness which showed a mind not at ease 
he was looking about he was going to the door he was watching for the sound of other carriages 
impatient to begin or afraid of being always near her 
mrs clifton was spoken of 
a i think the must be here soon a aid he 
a i have a great curiosity to see 8 earn

andallthenniland the propriety passed 
but mist gates and miss fairest 
a aid mr westons looking about 
we thought you were to bring them the mistake had been light 
the carriage was tent for them now 
emma longed to know what ankles 1st opinion of my eton might be 
how he wan affected by the studied elegance of her dress and her smile of gncinumeu 
he was immediately quality 
laying herself to form an opinion by giving her prior s attention after the introduction had feared 
no a few minutes the carriage resumed 
— somebody talked of him 
i will see that then are umbrella air said frank to his father miss abatement not be forgotten 
a and away he went 
mr westons wan following but mr eton detained him to gratify him by her opinion of his son 
and so briskly did she begin that the young man himself though by no means moving slowly could hardly be out of healing 
7 a very one young man indeed mr westons 
you know i candidly told you i should form my own on union 
and i am happy to any that i am extremely pressed with him 
you may believe me 
i never compliment 
i think him a very handsome young man and his manners are precisely what i like and approve 
so truly the gentleman without the least conceit or puppyism 
you must know i have a vast dislike to puppies 
quite a horror of them 
they were never runs 
-5 tolerated at male grove 
neither mr seeking nor me had ever any patience with them 
and we used sometimes to say very cutting things 
eliza who is mild almost to a fault bare with them much better while she talked of his son mr westons attention was chained 
but when she got to make grove he could recollect that there were ladies arriving to be attended to and with happy smiles must hurry away 
mrs eton turned to mrs westons 
a i have no doubt of its being our carriage with miss gates and jane 
our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditiously 
i believe we drive faster than anybody 
hat a pleasure it is to send one's manage for a friend i understand you were so kind as to offer but another time it will be quite unnecessary 
you may he very sure i shall always take care of t -5 miss gates and miss fairest escorted by the two gentlemen walked into the room 
end mrs eton seemed to think it as much her duty as mrs westons s to receive them 
her gesture and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like emma 
but her words everybody's words were soon lost under the incessant now of miss yates who came in talking and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire 
as the door opened she was heard 
a so very obliging you l 
no rain at all 
nothing to signify 
i do not care for myself 
quite thick shoes 
and jane declares 
well l a as soon as she was within the door dwell

but mr frank church wan is extremely

i am quite roasted 
no coffee i thank you for me 
never take entree 
a little ten if you please sir by-and-by 
no hurry 
oh 
here it comes 
everything so good 
an church returned to his station by emma 
and as soon as miss yates was quiet she found herself necessarily overacting the discourse of grierson and miss fairest who were tending a little way behind her 
he was thoughtful 
whether he were overbearing too she could not determine 
after i good many compliments to lane on her dress and look 
compliments very quietly and properly taken 
mrs clifton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself 
and it was 
how do you like my gown 
how do you like my trimming 
how has wight done my hair 
a vast many other relative questions all answered with patient politeness 
mrs eton then said 
8 nun 
a nobody can think less of dress in general than i do but upon inch an occasion an thin when everybody e eat are to much upon me and in compliment to the westons who i have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour 
i would not willing to be inferior to others 
and i very few 1 in the room e t mine 
— so frank churchillpi 
la capital dancer l demand 
we shall see if our style mist 
— 
a one young man certainly in frank church 
i like him very well 
at this moment frank began talking no vigorously that emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praise and did not want to hear more 
— and the voice of the ladies were drowned for a while till another inspection brought mrs eton tones again distinctly four 
mr clifton had just joined them and his wife was exclaiming 
a oh 
you have found us out at lean have a in our seclusion 2 
1 was this moment telling me i thought you would begin to he impatient for tidings of us 
a jane 
repeated frank church with a look of surprise and pleasure 
that is easy 
but miafairfax does not disapprove it i an no 
a how do you like mr eton 
a mind emma in a what care 
a not at all 
a you are ungnteful.” 1 ungrateful 
— 
what do you mean 2 then changing from a frown to a smile 
no do not tell me 
— i do not want to know what you meant where ll my father 
when are we to begin dancing 
a emma could hardly understand him 
he seemed in an odd humour 
he walked off to and his father but was quickly back again with both mr and mrs westons 
eliza 
4 he had met with them in a little perplexity which must be laid before emma 
it had just occurred to mrs lesson that mrs westons must be asked to begin the hall 
that she would expect it 
which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma that distinction 
emma heard the d truth with fortitude 
and what are we to do for a proper partner for her 
a said mr westons 
a she will think frank ought to ask her frank turned instantly to emma to claim her former promise 
and beamed himself an engaged man which his father looked his most wick approbation of 
and it then red that mrs son was wanting begins to dance with mrs eton himself and that their business was to help to persuade him into it which was done pretty soon 
mr easton and mrs eton led the way 
mr f rank church and miss warehouse followed 
emma must submit to stand scorn to mrs eton though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her 
it was almost enough to make her think of marrying 
mrs clifton had undoubtedly the advantage at this time in vanity completely gratified 
for though she had intended to begin with frank church she could not lose by the change 
mr westons might be his songs superior 
in spite of this little rubs however sum was smiling with enjoyment delighted to see the 11 respectable length of the set as it was forming and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual activity before her 
she was more disturbed by mr knighdey’s not dancing than by anything else 
there he was among the modern when he ought not to be 
he ought to be dancing not classing himself with the husbands and fathers and whiit-players who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their robbers were made up 
w young as he looked 
he could not have appeared so resign 
to greater advantage that an here than where he had placed himas 
pcl‘liswtallzwlirrn upright figure among the bulky forms and hoping shoulder of the elderly men was such as emma felt must draw everybody's eyes 
and next g her own partner there was not one among the who e now of young men who could be compared with him 
he moved a few steps nearer and those few step were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner with what natural grace he must have danced would be but take the trouble 
whenever she caught his eye she forced him to smile 
but in general he was looking grave 
she wished he could love a ball-room better and could like frank church better 
he seemed often observing her 
she must not flatter herself that he thought her dancing 
but if he were criticism her behaviour she did not feel afraid 
there was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner 
they seemed more like cheerful any friends than seven 
that frank church thought less of her than he had done was indubitable 
the ball proceeded plainly 
the anxious cares the incessant attentions of mrs westons were not thrown away 
everybody seemed happy 
and the praise of being a delightful ball which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this 
of very important very remarkable events it was not more productive than such meetings usually are 
there was one however which emma thought something of 
— the two last dances before supper were begun and harriet had no partner 
— the only young lady sitting down 
and to equal had been hitherto the number of dancers that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder 
but emma wonder lessened soon afterwards on seeing mr eton sauntering about 
he would not ask runs 
11 harriet to dance if were possible to be avoided 
she was sure he would not 
and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room 
escape however was not his plan 
he came to the part of the room where the sisterly were collected spoke to some and walked about in front of them as if to show his liberty and his resolution of maintaining it 
he did not omit being sometimes directly before miss smith or speaking to those who were close to her 
emma saw it 
she was not yet dancing 
she was working her way up from the bottom and had therefore leisure to look around and by only turning her head a little she saw it all 
when she was half way up the set the whole group were exactly behind her and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch 
but mr clifton was so near that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took lace between him and mrs westons 
and she perceived that his wife who was standing immediately above her was not only listening also but even encouraging him by significant glances 
the kind-hearted gentle mrs westons had left her seat to join him and say do not you dance mr eton 
a to which his promise reply was most readily mrs westons if you will see with men came 
— oh 
no 
i would get you a better partner than myself 
i am no danger a if mrs gilberts wishes to dance a said he 
i shall have great pleasure i am sure 
for though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man and that m dancing days are over it would give me very rest ensure at any time to stand up with an old friend fires mrs gilberts a mrs gilberts does not mean to dance but there is a young lady disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancing 
miss smith 
miss smith 
oh l 
i had not observed 
you are 9 runs 
extremely obliging 
and if i were not an old married 
but my dancing days are over mrs westons 
you will excuse me 
anything else i should be most happy to do at your command 
but my dancing days are over mrs westons said no more 
and emma could imagine with what surprise and mortification she must be returning to her seat 
this was mr eton 
the amiable obliging gentle mr eton 
she looked round for a moment 
he had joined mr night at a little distance and wan arranging himself for settled conversation while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife 
she would not look again 
her heart was in a glow and she feared her face might be as hot 
in another moment a happier right caught her 
mr nightly leading anxiety to the set 
never had she been more on ruled seldom more delighted than at that instant 
he was all pleasure and gratitude both for harriet and herself and longed to be thanking him 
and though too distant for speech her countenance said much as soon as she could catch his eye again 
his dancing proved to he just what she had believed it extremely good 
and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky if it had not been for the cruel state of thing before and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced 
it was not thrown away on her 
she bounded higher than ever few farther down the middle and was in a continual course of smiles 
mr clifton had retreated into the card-room looking emma trusted very foolish 
she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife though growing very like her 
-5 spoke some of her feelings by observing audible to her partner 
a nightly has taken pity on poor little miss smith 
— 
very good 
natured i declare 
emma 
49 sun s was announced 
the move began 
and miss yates might heard from that moment without ptemrption till her being seated at 
table and taking up her 
a one jane my dear jane where are you 
here is your i not 
mr westons begs you to put on your tippet 
the style she is afraid there will be brought in the passage though everything has been done 
one door raised up 
qualities of making 
my dear jane indeed you must 
mr church oh 
you are too obliging 
how well you put it on 
so gratified 
excellent dancing indeed 
yes my dear i ran home as i said i should to help grandmamma to bed and got back again and nobody missed me 
i set off without saying a word just as i told you 
grandmamma war quite well had a charming evening with mr warehouse a vast deal of chat and backgammon 
tea was made downstairs biscuits and walked apples and wine before she came away amazing luck in some of her sorrows and the inquired a great deal about you how on were amused and who were your partners 
oh 
said i a i shall not forestall jane 
left her dancing with mr george sway 
she will love to tell you all about it herself to-morrow her first partner was mr eton 
i do not know who will ask her next perhaps mr william could my dear sir you are too obliging 
ii there nobody you would not rather 
i am not helpless 
sir you are most kind 
upon my word jane on one arm and mean the other 
stop stop let us stand a little back mrs westons is going 
dear mrs eton how elegant she lanky-beautiﬁﬂ lace 
now we all follow in her train 
quite the queen of the evening 
well here we are at the passage 
two steps jane take care of the two steps 
oh no there is but one 
well i was persuaded there were two 
how very odd 
i was convinced there were two and there is but one 
i ll 
g 34 undue 
never saw anything only to the comfort and style 
candles even here 
wan telling you of your grandmamma 
anne 
there was a little dinppoinrrnent 
the basket applied and biscuits excellent in their way you know 
but 
there was a. delicate frigate of iweetread and some alparagul brought in at lists and good mr woodhouae not thinking the arparagru quite boiled enough sent it all out again 
now there is nothing grandmamma loves better than iweetbread andupangru 
no she was rather disappointed 
but 
we agreed we would not speak of it to anybody for fear of in getting round to dear miss woodhoule who would be no v much concerned 
well thin in brilliant 
i am i amazement l 
could not have supposed anythingn-euch elegance and prior 
i have seen nothing like it since 
well where dull we rites where shall we sit 
anywhere no that jane is not in a daughter 
where i lit in of no consequence 
oh 
do you recommend this side 
well i am sure mr church 
only it seem too good 
but just no you please 
what you direct in this home can not be wrong 
dear jane how shall we ever recollect half the wishes for grandmamma 
soup took bless me 
i should not he helped no soon but it smells most excellent and i can not help beginning emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr nightly till after supper 
but when they were all in the ballroom again her eye invited him irresistible to come to her and be thanked 
he was warm in his approbation of mr eton conduct 
it had been unpardonable hardened 
and mrs almost looks all received the due aware of censure 
they aimed at wounding more than harriet 1 laid he 
a emma why in it that they are your enemy 2 4 he looked with rosings nation 
and on receiving no answer added a be ought 
not to be angry man 
49 with you i suspect whatever he may be 
to that surmise you say nothing of course but confess emma that you did want him to marry harriet 
a i did a replied emma and they can not forgive income he shook his head 
but there was a smile of indulgence with it and he only said 
a i shall not scold you 
i leave you to your own reflections 
can you trust me with such lameness 
does my win irish ever tell me i am wrong 
a 30 your vain spirit but your serious irish 
if one leads you wrong i am sure the other tell i you of it 
i do own myself to have been completely taken in mr eton 
there is a littleness about him which you discovered and which i did not and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet 
it was through a series of strange blunders 
7 a and in return for your acknowledging so much i will do you the justice to say that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself 
harriet smith has some first-rate qualities which mrs westons is totally without 
an unpretending singleminded artless girl 
infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste of such a woman as mrs eton 
i found harriet more conversant than i expected emma was extremely gratified 
they were interrupted by the bustle of mr westons calling on everybody to begin dancing again 
a come miss warehouse miss way miss fairest what are you all doing 
come emma set your companions the example 
everybody is lazy 
everybody is asleep i a 5 i am ready said emma a whenever i am wanted 4 man 
“whomareyoo to dance with 
asked mr knight 
she hesitated a moment and then replied with you if you will ask me a win you 9 said he offering his 
hand 
a indeed i will 
you have shown that you can dance and you know we an not really on much brother and under a to make it at all improper a brother andliater 
— no indeed that fill 
his little explanation with mr nightly gave emma considerable palmers 
it was one of the agreeable recollections the ball which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy 
she wan extremely glad that they had come to no good an understanding respecting the toil and that their opinions of both husbands and wife were to much alike 
and his nine of harriet his conviction in her favour wan peculiar ye gratifying 
the impertinence of the westons which for a few starts had threatened to ruin the mass of her evening had been the occasion of name of its highest satisfaction 
and she looked forward to another happy result 
the cure of harriet infatuation 
from harriet manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ball-room else had strong hopes 
it seems an if her eyes were suddenly opened and the were enabled to see that mr clifton was not the superior creature the believed him 
the fever was over and emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by incurious con 
she depended on the evil feeling of the elation or an lying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could 12 further remain 
37 quite 
harriet rational a church not too much in love and mr nightly not wanting to quarrel with her how very happy 3 summer must be before her 
she was not to see frank church thin morning 
he had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of opposing it darted so he was to be home by the middle of the day 
she did not regret it 
having arranged all these matters looked them through and put them all to rights she was just turning to 6 the house with spirits fastened up for the demands of the two little boys as well as of their grandmamma when the great iron sweep-gate opened and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see whether 
an church with harriet leaning on his aunt 
actually harriet 
a mutual sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened 
harriet looked white and frightened and he was trying to cheer her 
the iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder 
they were all three noon in the hall 
and harriet immediately sinking into a chair tainted away 
a young lady who faint must recovered 
questions must be entered and surprises he explained 
such events are very interesting 
but the suspense of them can not last long 
a few minutes made sum as united with the whole 
is smith and miss bickerton another parlour board at my goddard’s who had been also at the ball had walked out together and taken a road 
the richmond road which though apparently music enough for safety had led them into alarm 
bout half a mile beyond higher making a sudden turn and deeply headed by else on each ride it became for a considerable stretch very retired 
and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it they had suddenly perceived at i small distance before them on a broader 38 emma 
pamhofgmemwaldbytheddgapmyofgipfn 
a child on the watch came toward them to beg 
and miss bickerton excessively frightened gave a great increase and calling on harriet to follow her ran up a steep bank dared a slight hedge at the top and made the best of her way by a short cut back to highly 
but poor harriet could not follow 
she had suffered very much from cramp after dancing 
and her pretty attempt to mount the it brought on inch a return of it as made her absolute powerless 
and in this state and exceedingly married the had been obliged to remain 
how the temper might have behaved had the young ladies been more courageously must be doubtful 
but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted 
and harriet wan noon assailed by half a dozen children headed by a stout woman and a. great boy all clamorous and impertinent in look though not absolutely in word 
more and more frightened the immediately promised them money and taking out her purse gave them a shilling 
and begged them not to want more or to use her ill. she was then able to walk though but slowly and wan moving away 
but her terror and her purse were too tempting 
and the we followed or rather surrounded by the whole gazing demanding more 
in this state frank church had found her the trembling and conditions they loud and insolent 
by a most fortunate chance his leaving higher had been delayed to as to bring him to her finances at this critical moment 
the pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward and leave his horses to meet him by another road a mile or two beyond higher 
and happening to have borrowed a of scissors the night before of miss gates and to have forgotten to require them he had been obliged to stop ennui 
49 at her door and go in for a few minutes 
he was therefore later than he had intended 
and being on foot was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them 
the terror which woman and boy had been wing in harriet was then their own portion 
he had left them completely frightened 
and harriet eagerly clinging to him and hardly able to speak had strength enough to reach hatfield before her spirits were quite overcome 
it was his idea to bring her to hatfield 
he had thought of no other lace 
this was the amount of the whole story 
of his communication and of harﬁet’gas soon as she had moved her senses and speech 
he dared not stay larger than to see her well 
— 
— those several delays left her not another minute to lose 
and emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to mrs guard and force of their being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to mr nightly he set off with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself 
such an adventure as the 
a one young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way 
could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steady brain 
so emma thought at last 
could a disgust could a grammar-inn could even a mathematician have seen what she did 
have witnessed their appearance together and heard their history of it without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other 
how much more must an imagines like herself be on are with speculation and foresight 
— especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her sound had already made 
it was a very extraordinary thing 
nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place within her memory 
no rencontre no alarm of i to miss 
the kind 
and now it had happened to the very person and at the very hour when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her 
it certainly w very extort 
and knowing as she did the favourable state 
mind of each at this period it struck her the more 
he was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself she just recovering from her maria for mr eton 
it seemed as if everything united to promise the most interesting consequence 
it was at possible that the occurrence should not be strong recommending each to the other 
in the few minutes conversation which she had yet had with him while harriet had been partially insensible he had spoken of her terror her na'i‘veté her favour as she seized and clung to his arm with a sensible amused and delighted 
and at last after harriet own account had been given he had x refused his indignation at the abominable folly of miss exertion in the warmest terms 
everything was to take its natural course however neither impelled nor assisted 
she would not stir a sister do a hint 
no she had had enough of its noise 
me could be no harm in a scheme a mere passive scheme 
it was no more than a wish 
beyond it she would on no account proceed 
emma first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion 
but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible within half an hour it was known all over higher 
it was the very event to engage those who talk most 
the young and the low 
and all the minds and servants in the place were soon in the lulppincts of frightful news 
the last night ball seemed lost in the glimpses 
poor mr warehouse trembled as he sat and as emma had foreseen would years or be satisfied without their promising never to go emma 
or he and the shrubbery again 
was some comfort to hills that many inquiries after himself and miss woodhouae for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after a well an miss smith were coming in during the rest of the day 
and he had the pleasure of returning for answer that they were all very indifferent 
which though not exactly true for she was perfectly well and harriet not much otherwise emma would not interfere with 
she had an unhappy late of health in general for the child of wet a man for she hardly knew what indisposition was 
and if he did not invent a sense for her she could make no sure in a message 
the gipaiea did not wait for the operations of justice 
they took themselves at 
in a hurry 
the young ladies of higher might have walked again in felt before their pedantic began and the whole history mind led noon into a matter of little importance but to emma and her nephew in her imagination it maintained its ground 
and henry and john were still making 17 day for the story of harriet and the graces and stir l tenacious netting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital 
than 11 
a very few days had led after this adventure when harriet came one morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand and after sitting down and hesitating thus began 
a miss woodhonse 
if you are at leisure i have something that i should like to tell you a nor of confusion to make 
and then you know it will be over emma was a good deal surprised 
but begged her to speak 
there was a oerioumresa in harriet manner whichpteparedher qdreannehaherwovdqfor iomethingmorednn

but i think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable i shall never forget her look the other night 
however i must you in woodhmue i with her no evil

let them be ever in happy together it will not give me another moment pang 
and to convince you that i have been speaking truth i am now going to destroy 
what i ought to have destroyed long ago 
what i ought never to have kept i know that very well 1 blushing a she spoke 
a however now i will destroy it all 
and it in my particular with to do it in your presence that you may see how rational i am grown 
can not you guess what thin parcel holds 
a laid he with a conscious look 
a not the least in the world 
did he ever give you anything 
no 
i can not all them gifts 
but they are things that i have valued very much sum 
20 she held the parcel towards her and emma red the words mr 
pains features on the 
her curiosity was greatly excited 
harriet unfold led the parcel and she looked on with impatience 
within abundance of silver per was a pretty little tunbridge-wnre box which indies opened it was well lined with the stoutest cotton 
but excepting the cotton emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister 
a now a mind harriet 1 you m 
recollection no indeed i do not bear me 
i should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about courtrplaister one of the very last times we ever met in it 
it was but a very few 21 s before i had my sore trash 
just before mr and mrs john nightly came 
i think the very evening 
do not you remember his cutting his eager with your new penknife and your recommending oourt-plnister 
but as you had none about you and knew i bad you desired me to supply him 
and so i took mine out and cut him a piece but it was a great deal too large and he cut it smaller and kept playing some time with what was left before he gave it back to me 
and so then in my nonsense i could not help making a treasure of it 
so i put it by never to be used and looked at it now and then as a great treat my dearest harriet 
a cried emma putting her hand before her face and jumping up a you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear 
remember it 
aye i remember it all now 
all except your saving this relics i knew nothing of that till this moment 
but the coming the danger and my recommending court-plailter and saying i had none about me 
— 
oh 
my deal my sins l 
and i had plenty all the while in my pocket 
one of my senseless tricks 
i deserve to be under continual blush all the rest of 10 urn 
my life 
well a sitting down again go on what else 2 7 a and had you really comes at hand yourself 
i am sure i never suspected it you did it to naturally 5 and w you actually put this piece of court-planter by for his sake 
laid emma recovering from her note of sharpe and feeling 
divided between wonder and amusement 
and secretly inclined to herself lord blew me 
when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court-plaiuer that frank church had been pulling about 
i never was equal to think a here named harriet turning to her box again a here in something still more valuable 
i mean that la been more valuable 
because this is what did really once belong to him which the court-plainter never did 
a emma wan quite eager to see this superior tremors 
it was the end of an old pencil the part without any lead 
this was really his a said harriet 
a do not you remember one morning i 
no i dare lay you do not 
but one morning 
i forget exactly the day 
but perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before julia 
evening he wanted to make a memorandums in his pocket-book 
it wan about spruce-beer 
mr nightly had been telling him something about being struck 
better and he wanted to put it down 
but when he took out his pencil there war no little lead that he soon cut it all away and it would not do is you lent him another and thin was left upon the table at good for nothing 
but i kept my eye on it 
and at noon an i dared caught it up and never parted with it again from that moment a i do remember it cried emma 
a i perfectly remember it 
talking about spruce-beer 
oh 
yes 
mr slightly and i both saying we liked it and mr eton seeming resolved to learn to like it too 
i perfectly man 
mrs remember it 
stop 
mr nightly wounding just here was not he 
i have an idea he was standing just here ah 
i not know 
i can not recollect 
it is very odd but i can not recollect 
mr clifton was aiming here i remember much about where i am now well go on a a oh 
that 5 all 
i have nothing more to show you or to say except that i am now going to throw them both behind the are and i wish you to see me do it 
my poor dear harriet 
and have you actually found happiness in preparing up these things 
a year simpleton as i was l 
but i am quite ashamed of it now and wish i could forget an easily as i can burn them 
it was very wrong of me you know to keep any remembrance after he was married 
i knew it wan 
but had not relolnu'on enough to part with them but harriet in it necessary to burn the courtplaiuter 
i have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the court-plain“ might be useful i shall he happier to burn it a replied harriet 
a it has a disagreeable look to me 
i must get rid of everything 
then it gone and there in an end thank heaven 
of mr eton and when a thou hat emma will there he a beginning of mr church i 
she had noon afterwards moon to believe that the beginning was already made and could not but ho that the gapes though the had told no fortune might 5 proved to have made harriet 
about a fortnight after the alarm they came to a sufficient explanation and quite undesignedly 
emma was not thinking of it at the moment which made the information the received more valuable 
she mere aid in the course of some trivial chat dwell harriet whenever you marry i 16 runs 
would advise you to do so and so 
— and thought no more of it till after a minutes silence she heard harriet say in a very serious one i shall never marry emma then looked up and immediately saw how it was 
and after a moment's debate a to whether it should pass unnoticed or not replied 
a never marry l 
this is a new rewlution.” 
it is one that i shall never change however after another short hesitation 8 i ha it does not proceed from 
i hope it is not in compose a em to mr eton 
mr eton indeed 
a cried harriet indignantly 
a oh l no 
— and emma could just catch the world a so superior to mr eton 
a she then took a longer time for consideration 
should she proceed no farther 3 
should she let it pass and seem to expect nothing pop 
perhaps harriet might think her cold or angry if he did 
or perhaps if she were totally silent it might only drive harriet into asking her to hear too much 
and again anything like such an unreserve as had been such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances she was perfectly resolved 
she believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once all that she meant to lay and know 
plain dealing was always best 
she had previously determined how far she would proceed on any application of the sort 
and it would be safer for both to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with she was decided and thus spoke 
— a married i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning 
your resolution or rather your expectation of never marrying results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you 
is not it so 21 a oh miss warehouse believe me i have not the mr 
-5 potions to suppose 
indeed i am not so mad 
but it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world with the gratitude wonder and veneration which are so proper in me especially i am not at all surprised at you harriet 
the service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart 
a serious oh it was such an inexpressible obligation 
the very recollection of it 
and all that i felt at the time when i w him coming 
his noble look and my wretched before 
such a change 
in one moment such a change 
from perfect misery to perfect happiness 
7 a it is very natural 
it is natural and it in honourable 
yes honourable i think to choose so well and so gratefully 
but that it will be a fortunate preference is more than i can promise 
i do not advise you to give away it hamlet 
i do not by any means engage for it being returned 
consider what you are about 
perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can at any rate do not let them carry you far unless you are persuaded of his liking you 
be observant of him 
let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations 
i give you this caution now because i shall never speak to you again on the subject 
i am determined against all interference 
henceforward i know nothing of the matter 
let no name ever pass our lips 
we were very wrong before 
we will be cautious now 
he is your superior no doubt and there do seem objections and obstacles of a serious nature 
but yet harriet more wonderful things have taken lace there have been matches of greater disparity 
but take care of yourself 
i would not have you too sanguine 
though however it may end heassnredthatyour rallingyour thoughts to louisa is a 18 emma 
mark of good taste which i shall always know how to value a harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude 
emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend 
it tendency would be to raise and resume her mind 
and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation 
chapter 31 
a this state of schemes and hopes and convince june opened upon heated 
to highly in general it brought no material change 
the westons were mill talking of a visit from the stockings and of the use to be made of their harouehe-landau and jane fairest was still at her grandmothers 
and as the return of the campbell from ireland wan again delayed and august instead of midsummer fixed for it she was likely to remain here full two months longer provided at least she were able to defer mrs allen's activity in her service and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will 
mr nightly who for some reason best known to himself had certainly taken an early dislike to f rank church was only growing to dislike him more 
he began to expect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of emma 
that emma was his object appeared indisputable 
everything declared it 
his own attention his father s hints his mother-in-law guarded fence 
it was all in unison 
words conduct discretion and indiscretion told the same story 
but while so many were devoting him to emma and emma herself making him over to harriet mr nightly began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with jane emma 
i or fair 
he could not understand it 
but there were symptoms of intelligence between sam 
he thought so at least 
symptoms of admiration on his side which having once observed he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning however he might wish to escape any of emma errors of imagination 
so was not present when the suspicion 1st arose 
he was dining with the rascally family and jane at the westons 
and he had seen a look more than a single look at miss fairest which from the admirer of miss woodhonse seemed somewhat out of place 
when he was again in their company he could not help remembering what he had seen 
nor could he avoid observations which unless it were like cowper and his are at twilight 1 myself creating what i saw a brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking 
of private understanding even between f rank church and jane 
he had walked up one day after dinner as he very often did to spend his evening at hatfield 
emma and habit were going to walk 
he joined them 
and on returning they fell in with a larger party who like themselves judged it wisest to take their exercise early as the weather threatened rain 
mr and mrs easton and their son miss gates and her niece who had accidentally met 
they all united 
and on reaching hatfield gates emma who knew it was exceed the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her farther pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him 
the rascally party agreed to it immediately 
and after a pretty long speech from miss hates which few persons listened to she also found it possible to accept dear miss woodhouse’s most obliging invitation 
as they were turning into the grounds mr parry 11 
he l 10 emma 
posted by on honehacln the gentlemen spoken of his home 
a by the bye 1 laid frank church to mrs westons presently a what became of mr parry plan of setting up his carriage 2 mr westons looked surprised and laid 8 i did not know that he ever had any such plan may i had it from you 
you more me word of it three month again a me 
impossible 
a indeed you did 
i remember it perfectly 
you mentioned is as what was certainly 40 he very noon 
mr party had told somebody and win extremely happy about it 
it was owing to bet persuasion a she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm 
you must remember it now 2 1 upon my word i never heard of it till this moment a never 
really never 
bless me 
how could it he 
then i must have dreamt it 
but i was completely sailed 
miss smith you walk m if you were tired 
on will not be marry to and yourself at home that in thin -5 
— that in thin 
a cried mr westons about parrys and a carriage 
in perrygoin is net up his carriage frank 
i am glad he can 1810 it 
you had it from himself had you 
no air a replied his son laughing 
i seem to have had it from nobody 
very odd 
i really wan persuaded of mr westons having mentioned it in one of her letters to combe many week ago with all there nicularx 
but an the declares she never heard a 
holla e of it before of course it must have been a dream 
i am a great dreamer 
i dream ofcverybodyzat higher when i am away 
and when i have gone through my particular friend then i begin dreaming of mr and mr parry emma 
ill a it in odd though a observed his father a that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should he thinking of at income 
perhaps setting up his carriage 
and his wife persuading him to it out of care for his health 
jolt what will happen i have no doubt worse time or other 
only a little premature 
what an air of probability sometimes ma through a dream 
and at others what a head of absurdities it is 
well f rank your dream certainly shows that higher ruin your thoughts when you are absent 
emma you are a great dreamer i think 
emma was out of hearing 
she had hurried on before her guest to prepare her father for their appearance and was beyond the reach of mr westons hint 
why to own the truth a cried miss yates who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes if i must speak on this subject there is no denying that mr f rank church might have 
just do not mean to say that he did not dream it 
i am sure i have sometimes the oddest dream in the world 
but if i am questioned about it i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring 
for mr parry herself mentioned it to my mother and the sole knew of it no well an observer 
but it was quite a secret known to nobody else and only thought of about three days 
mr parry war very anxious that he should have a carriage and came to my mother in great spirit 
one morning because she thought she had failed 
jane don't you remember grandmanuna’at in no of it when we got home 
i forget where we had been walking to 
very 
likely to rascally 
yes i think it was to rascally 
mrs party was always particularly fond of my mother 
indeed i do not know who in not 
and the had mentioned it to her in confidence 
the had no 16 emma 
objection to her telling m of course but it wan not to go beyond 
and from that day to thin i never mentioned it to a soul that i know of 
at the woe time i will not positively answer for my having never drop 
a hint because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware 
i am a talker on know 
i am rather a talker 
and now and then have let a thing escape me which i should not 
i am not like jane 
i with i were 
i will answer for it -5 never betrayed the least thing in the world 
where ashes oh 
just behind 
perfectly remember my parrys coming 
extraordinary dream indeed 
a they were entering the hall 
mr knightley'l eye 
had preceded miss beat in a glance at jane 
from frank churchill’s face where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away he had involuntarily turned to hers 
but she was indeed behind and too busy with her shawl 
mr westons had walked in 
the two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her mr nightly respected in frank church the determination of catching her eye 
he seemed watching her intently 
in vain however if it were of 
jane passed between them into the hall and looked at neither 
there was no time for farther remark or explanation 
the dream must be borne with and mr nightly must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circulated table which emma had introduced at hand and which none but emma could have had power to place there and made her father to use instead of the ill-sized broke on which two of his daily meals had for forty years been crowded 
tea planned pleasantly and nobody seemed in a hurry to move 
a miss woodhouee a rapid frank church after examining a table behind him which he could reach as he sat a have our nephew taken away their alphabet 
their box of extent 
it need to and here 
where in it 
emma 
m 13 this is a sort of ill-looking evening that ought to be trusted there winter than summer 
we had great amusement with those letter 
one morning 
i want to puzzle you again 
v emma was pleased with the thought 
and producing the box the table wan quickly scattered over with alphabet which no one seemed to much disposed to employ as their two selves 
they were rapid forming word for each other or for anybody e who would he puzzled 
the quiet of the game made it particularly eligible for mr woodhoune who had often end distressed by the more animated 11 which mr westons had occasionally introduced and who now at happily occupied in lamenting with tender melancholy over the departure of the poor little boys a or in fondly pointing out at he took up any may letter near him how beautifully emma had written it 
frank church placed a word before mr 
fairest 
she gave a slight glance round the table and applied herself to it 
frank was next to emma jane opposite to them 
and mr nightly no placed as to see them all 
and it was his object to see as much at he could with as little apparent observation 
the word wan discovered 
and with a faint smile pushed away 
if meant to be immediately mixed with the others and buried from sight she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across for it 
was not mixed 
and harriet a rap after every fresh word and finding out none desire took it up and fell to work 
she was sitting by dab slightly and turned to him for help 
the word was blunder and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it there was a blush on james cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise sensible 
mr knight cry connected it with the dream 
but how it could all be was beyond his comprehension 
how the delicacy the discretion of his favourite could have been no sounds 
so lain asleep 
he feared there must be some decided involvement 
dingmuousnm and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn 
these letters were but the veil for gallantry and trick 
it was a child play chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank churchill’s part 
with great indignation did he continue to observe him 
with great alarm and dinner to observe also his so blinded companions 
he saw a short word prepared for emma and given to her with a look sly and demure 
he saw that emma had soon made it out 
and found it highly entertaining though it was something which she judged it prior s to appear to censure 
for she aid 1 nonsense 
or shame 
4 he heard frank church next say with a glance towards june 1 i will give it to her 
shall i it and as clearly heard emma opposing it with eager laughing warmly 
no no you must not you shall not indeed it was done however 
this gallant young man who seemed to love without feeling and to recommend himself without complaisance directly handed over the word to miss fair and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it 
mr knights excessive curiosity to know what this word might made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it and it was not long before he saw it to he diction 
jane fairfax’s perception seemed to accept a by his 
her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning the superior intelligence of those over letters so arranged 
she was evidently displeased 
looked up and seeing herself watched blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her and saying only a i did not know that proper names were allowed wished away the letters with even an angry spirit and looked resort used to he engaged by no other word that could he offered 
her face was averted from those must 
-5 who had made the attack and turned towards her aunt 
a ay very true my dear a cried the latter though janehadnot spoken word i wasjustgoing today the same thing 
it is time for us to he going indeed 
the evening is long in and grandmamma will be looking for us 
my dear sir you are too obliging 
we really must wish you good-nlght 
jane s alertness in motion proved he 
as may as her at had preconcerted 
he was immediately up and wanting to quit the table but so many were also moving that she could not get away 
and mr nightly thought he saw soldier collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her and resolutely swept away by her examined 
she was afterwards looking for her shawl 
frank church was looking also it was growing dusk and the room was in confusion 
and how thezlpaned mr nightly could not tell 
e remained at hatfield after all the rest his thoughts full of what he had seen 
so full that when the candles came to assist his observations he must 
yes he certainly must as a friend 
an anxious friend 
— give emma some him ask her some question 
he could not see her in a situation of such danger without trying to preserve her 
it was his duty 
pray emma a said he may i ask in what lay the gout amusement the point at sting of the last word given to you and miss fair -5 i saw the word and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one and so very distressing to the other emma was extremely confused 
she could not endure to give him the true explanation 
for though her sons were by no means removed she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them 
oh 
she cried impudent embarrassment it all meant nothing a mere joke among ourselves no man 
the joke 4 he replied gravely esteemed continued to on and mr churchill.” e had hoped she would speak again but the did not 
she would rather hey herself about anything than speak 
he sat a little while in doubt 
a variety of evils crossed his mind 
interference 
miles inference 
emma confusion and the acknowledged intimacy seemed to declare her affection engaged 
yet he would speak 
he owed it to her to risk anything that might be involved in an unwelcome interference later than her welfare 
to encounter anything rather than the remembrance of neglect in each a cause 
a my dear emma a said he at last with earnest kindness do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of 
a between mr frank church and miss fairest 
oh yes perfectly 
why do you make a doubt of it 
a have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her or that she admired him 
a never never 
a she cried with a most open eagerness 
a never for the twentieth part of a moment did much an idea occur to me 
and how could it possibly come into your head 
a i have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between them 
certain x receive look which i did not believe meant to he put -5 
oh 
you amuse me excessively 
i am delighted to and that you can vouchsafed to let your imagination wander 
but it will not do 
ve entry to check you in your list any but indeed it will not do 
there in no admiration between them i do assure you and the appearances which have caught you have arisen from some peculiar circumstances 
feelings rather of a totally different nature 
it it impossible exactly to explain

1 16 there is a good deal of none in it 
but the part which is capable of being communicate which in sense in that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another a any two being in the world can be 
that i submit forenoon bride and 1 can were for in being to on his 
i will answer for the gentleman indifference she spoke with a confidence which staggered with a satisfaction which silenced mr knight 
she wan gay spirits and would have prolonged e conversation wanting to hear the cups are of his malicious every look described and all the were and how of a circumstance which highly entertained her 
but his gaiety did not meet hen 
bye found he could not be useful and his feelings were too much irritated for talking 
that he might not be irritatedinto an absolute fever by the tire which mr woodhouae’a tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year he soon afterward took a hasty leave and walked home to the coolness and solitude of dwell abbey 
ship 
it 
after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from mr and on seeking the bit bury world were obliged to endure the ramiﬁcation of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn 
no such imitation of novelty could enrich their intellectual street present 
in the daily interchange of news they must be again retracted to the other topics with which for a while the sncklings’ coming had been united such a the last account of mrs church who health seemed everyday to supply a different report and the situation of men when i 18 menus 
whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually he as much increased by the arrival of a child as that of all her neighbour was by the approach of it 
mrs clifton was very much disappointed 
it was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and pane 
her introductions and recommendations must all wait and every projected party be still only talked of 
so she thought at first 
but a little consideration convinced her that everything need not be put off 
why should not they explore to box hill though the sun image did not come 
they could go there again with them in the autumn 
it was settled that they should go to box hill 
that there was to be such a party had been long generally known 
it had even given the idea of another 
emma had never been to box hill 
she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing and she and mr woman had agreed to choose some one morning and drive thither 
two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them and it was to be done in a quiet unpretending elegant way inanimate superior to the bustle and preparation the regular eating and drinking and comic parade of the tone and the sparkling 
this was so very well understood between them that emma could not but feel some surprise and a little displeasure on hearing from mr wrong that he had been reporting to mrs eton as her brother and sister had 
led her that the two parties should unite and go together 
and that an mrs clifton had very readily acceded to it so it was to be if she had no objection 
now as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs elation of which mr westons must already be perfectly aware it was not worth bringing forward again 
it could not be done without a reproof to him which would be giving pain to his wife 
and she found herself therefore obliged to both to an amusement runs 
1 19 which she would have done a great deal to avoid 
an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of mr westons party 
every feeling was offended 
and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable good-will of mr woman s temper 
i am glad you approve of what i have done a said he very comfortably 
a but i thought you would 
such schemes as these are nothing without numbers 
one can not have too large a party 
a large party secures its own amusement 
and she is a good-natured woman after all 
one could not leave her out emma denied none of it aloud and agreed to none of it in private 
it was now the middle of june and the weather one 
and mr clifton was wing impatient to name the day and settle with mr eton as to surgeon 
pies and so d lamp when a lame carriage-horses raw everything into sad uncertainty 
it might be weeks it might be only a few days before the home were able 
but no preparations could he ventured on and it was all melancholy stagnation 
mrs westons resources were inadequate to such an attack 
is not this most vexatious knights 
a she cried 
a and such weather for exploring 
these delays and disappointments are quite odious 
what are we to do 
the year will wear away at this rate and nothing done 
before this time last year i assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from male grove to kings westons you had better explore to dwell replied mr nightly 
a that may be done without horses 
come and eat my strawberries 
they are repenting fast 
if mr nightly did not begin seriously he was 12 eliza 
obliged to proceed to 
for his proposal walcaughtat with delight 
and the 
oh 
i should like it of all things was not plainer in words than manner 
well what famous for its mulberry 
hands which seemed a plea for the invitation 
but no plan was necessary 
manage 
beds would have been enough to tempt the lady who only wanted to be going somewhere 
she promised him again and again to come 
much oftener than he doubted 
and was extremely guided by such a proof of intimacy inch a distinguishing compliment as the chosen to consider it 
a you may depend upon me a laid the 
a i certainly will come 
— 
name your day and i will come 
you will allow me to bring jane fairest 
a i can not name a day said he a till i have spoken to some others whom i would wish to meet you a or leave all that to me 
only give me a canehlanche 
— i am lady patroness you know 
it is my party 
i will bring and 
with me a i hope you will bring westons said he 
a but i will not true e you to give any other invitation a on now you are looking very sly 
— 
but consider 
you need not be afraid of defeating power to one 
i am no young lady on her preferment 
married women you know may be safely authorized 
it is my party 
leave it all to me 
i will invite your guard 5 no he calmly replied 1 there in but one married woman in the we d whom i can everallow to invite what guest she pleasure to welland that one is a man woodston i oppose 1 under mrs westons rather mortified 
no 
mrs nightly 
and till she is in being i will manage such matters myself 
a ah you are an odd creature 
a she cried satisfied emma 
21 to have no one preferred to herself 
you are a humours and may say what you like 
quite a humours 
well i shall bring jane with me 
jane and her aunt 
the rest i leave to you 
i have no objections at all to meeting the hardest family 
does scruple i know you are attached to them 
you certainly will meet them if i can prevail 
and i shall call on miss yates in my way home a that is quite unnecessary 
i see jane every day 
— but as you like 
it is to be a morning scheme you know nightly 
quite a simple thing 
i shall war a large bonnet and bring one of my little basket hanging on my arm 
here 
— probably this basket with pink ribbon 
nothing can be more simple you see and jane will have such another 
there is to be no form or parade 
a son of gigs party 
we are to walk about your gardens and rather the strawberries ourselves and sit under trees 
and whatever else you may like to ride it is to be all out of doors 
a table spread in the shade you know 
everything as natural and simple as possible 
is not that your idea in a not quite 
my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining-room 
the nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies with their servants and furniture i think is best observed by meals within doors 
when you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden there shall be cold meat in the house 
a well as you please 
only doubt have a great stout 
and by the bye can i or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion 
pray be sincere nightly 
if you wish me to talk to mrs hodges or to inspect anything 
a i have not the least wish for it i thank you well 
but if an difficulties should arise my housekeeper is extremely my clever i 2 i emma 
a i will answer for it that mine thinks herself sadly an clever and would spare anybody s assistance 
a i wish we had a turkey 
be thing would be for us all to come on duke jane miss gates and me and my sarah for walking by 
i really must talk to him about purchases a turkey 
in a country life i conceive it to be a sort of necessary 
for let a woman have ever so many resources it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home 
and very long walks you know 
in summer there is dust and in winter there is dirt 
you will not and either between well and higher 
well lane is never dust and now it is perfectly dry 
come on a done however if you prefer it 
you can borrow mr colds 
i would with everything to be as much to your taste as possible that i am sure you would 
indeed i do you justice my good friend 
under that peculiar 14 of dry blunt manner i know you have the warmest heart 
an i tell mr e. you are a thorough humorous 
yes believe me nightly i am fully sensible of us attention to me in the whole of this scheme 
on have hit a no the very thing to please me 
m nightly had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade 
he wished to persuade mr warehouse as well as emma to join the party 
and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of door to eat would inevitably make him ill. mr woodhousc must not under the precious genteel of a morning drive and an hour or two spent at well be tempted 
away to his misery 
he was invited on good faith 
no lurking horrors were to a mind him for his easy incredulity 
he did consent 
e had not been at well for two years 
a some very one morning he and emma and harriet could go very well 
and he could sit still with mr em 
23 westons while the dear girls walked about the gardens 
he did not suppose they could he damp now in the middle of the day 
he should like to see the old house main exceedingly and should he very happy to meet t and mr easton and any other of his neighbours 
he could not see any objection at all to his and mammas and harriet s going there some very one morning 
he thought it very well done of mr knightleytoinvitethem 
very kind sensible 
much clearer than dining out 
he was not fond of dining out mr night was fortunate in everybody's most read concurrence 
the invitation was everywhere so well received that it seemed as if like mrs eton they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves 
emma and harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it 
and mr westons unasked promised to get frank over to them if possible 
a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispense with 
mr nightly was then obliged to my that he should be glad to see him 
and mr westons engaged to lose no time in writing and spare no mgunwnts to induce him to come 
in the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast that the party to box hill was again under ha s consideration 
and at last unwell was settled 1 one day 
and box hill for the next the weather appearing exactly right 
under a bright monday sun at almost midsummer mr warehouse was safely conveyed in his carriage with one window down to partake of this al-fresco party 
and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the abbey especially part and for him by a are all the morning he was happy placed quite at his ease ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieve and advise everybody to come and sit down and not to heat 1 24 can 
themselves 
mrs westons who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired and it all the time with him remained when all the others were invited or persuaded out his patient listener and sympathize 
it was so long since emma had been at the abbey that as soon a the was satisfied of her father comfort the was glad to leave him and look around her 
eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be to interesting to her and all her family 
she felt all the longest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future pray stop could fairly woman as the viewed the respect less size and style of the building in suitable becoming characteristic situation low and sheltered 
it ample gardens stretching down to meadows wished by a stream of which the a with all the old neglect of respect had scarcely height 
and in abundance of tilney in rows and avenues which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up 
the house was larger than artful and totally unlike it covering a good deal of ground rambling and irregular with many comfortable and one or two handsome room 
it was just what it ought to be and it looked what it was 
and emma felt an increasing respect for it as the residence of a family of such true gentility ungenteel in blood and understanding 
some faults of temper john kuiglltlcy had 
but isabella had connected herself unexceptionable 
she had given them neither men nor names nor places that could raise a blush 
those were pleasant feelings and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did and collect round the strawberry-beds 
the whole party were assembled excepting frank church who was expected every moment from richmond 
and mrs ton in all her emma 
20 separates of happiness her large bonnet and her basket was very ready to lead the w in gathering accepting or talking

tired to death 
could bear it no longer 
must go and sit in the shade such for half an hour was the conversation 
interrupted only once by mrs westons who came out in her solicitude after her son 
inn to inquire if he were come 
and she was a little uneasy 
she had some fears of his horse 
tears solely in the shade were found 
and now emma obliged to overhear what mrs easton and jane fairest were talking of 
a situation a most desirable situation was in question 
mrs clifton had received notice of it that morning and was in m surest 
it was not with mrs shocking it was not wise mrs begged but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them it was with a cousin of mrs dragged an acquaintance of mrs packing a lady known at ma leg grove 
delightful charming superior first circles sphere lines ranks everything and mrs clifton was ii 
i 16 unites 
wild to have the other closed with immediately 
on her side all was warmth energy and triumph 
and she positively refused to take her friend negative though miss fairest continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in anything 
long the same motives which she had been heard to urge before 
still mrs eton insisted on being authorized to write an acquiescence by the morrow post 
how jane could hear it at all was astonishing to emma 
she did look vexed 
she did speak pointedly 
and at last with a decision of action unusual to her supposed a removal 
should not they walk 
w d not mr nightly show them the gardens 
all the gardens 
she wished to see the whole extent the pettiuacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear 
it was hot 
and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered dispersed way scarcely any three together they insensible followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of times which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river seemed the wish of the pleasure grounds 
it led to nothing 
nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high billiards which seemed intended in their erection to give the appearance of an approach to the home which never had been there 
disputable however as might be the taste of such a termination it was in itself a charming walk and the view which closed it extremely pretty 
the considerable slope at nearly the foot of which the abbey stood gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds 
and at half a mile distant was bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur well clothed with wood 
and at the bottom of this bank favourably placed and sheltered rose the abbey mill farm with meadows in front and the river making a close and handsome curse around it 
emma 
47 itwasacweetview 
cweetwtheeyeandthe mind 
english verdure english captures english comfort seen under a sun bright without being oppressive 
in this walk emma and mr westons found all the others assembled 
and toward this view she immediately perceived mr slightly and harriet distinct from the rest quietly leading the way 
mr slightly and harriet 
it was an odd tete-a-tete 
but she was glad to see it 
there had been a time when he would have seemed her as a companion and turned from her with little ceremony 
now they seemed in pleasant conversation 
there had been a time also when emma would have been sorry to see harriet in a spot so favourable for the abbey mill farm 
but now she feared it not 
it might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty its rich pasture spreading locks orchard in bloom and light cousin of smoke ascending 
she joined them at the wall and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around 
he was giving harriet information as to model of agriculture c. 
and emma received a smile which seemed to say a these are my own concerns 
i have a right to talk on such subjects without being suspected of introducing robert marking 
she did not suspect him 
it was too old a story 
robert maria had probably ceased to think of harriet 
they took a few turns together along the walk 
the shade was most refreshing and emma found it the pleasantest part of the day 
the next remove was to the house 
they must all go in and eat 
and they were all seated and buy and still frank church did not come 
mrs westons looked and looked in vain 
his father would not own himself uneasy and laughed at her fears 
but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare 
he had expressed himself as to coming with 18 emma 
more than common certainty 
his aunt was so much better that he had not a doubt cutting over to them on churchill’s state however as many were ready to remind her was liable to such men variation as might disappoint her nephew in the man reasonable dependence 
and mr son was at last persuaded to believe or to any that it must be by some attack of mr church that he was prevented coming 
emma looked at harriet while the point 
was under consideration 
she behaved very well and betrayed no emotion 
thecoldrepastwasover the party were to go outonccmoreto what lady not yet been seen the old abbey ﬁsh-ponds 
perhaps get as far an the lower which was to be begun cutting on the morrow or at any rate have the pleasure of being hot and growing cool again 
mr woodhouae who has already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens where no jumps from the river were imagined even by him stirred no more 
and his daughter resolved to remain with him that mrs westons might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need 
mr nightly had done all in his power for mr woodhonse'a entertainment 
books of engravings drawers of morals cares coals shelf and every other family collection within his habits had been 7 red for his old friend to while away the morning 
and the kindness had perfectly answered 
mr warehouse had been exceedingly well amused 
mrs westons had been showing them all to him and now he would show them all to emma 
fortunate in having no all 
a resemblance to a child than in a total want of taste for what he saw for he was slow constant and methodical before this second looking over was begun however emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments free observation of the entrance and grounds 
23 lot of the house and was hardly there when jane fairest appeared coming quickly in from the garden and with a look of escape 
little expecting to meet miss woodhonse so soon there was a start at first 
but miss warehouse was the very person she was in quest of 
will you he so kind 1 said she a when i am missed put that am gone home 
i am going this moment 
my aunt is not aware how late it is nor how long we have been absent 
but i am sure we shall he wanted and i am determined to go directly 
i have said nothing about it to anybody 
it would only be giving trouble and distress 
some are gone to the words and some to the lime-walk 
till they all come in i shall not he missed 
and when they do will you have the goodness to say that i am gone 
7 a certainly if you wish it 
but you are not going to walk to highly alone 
yes 
what should nurture 
i walk fast 
i shall be at home in twenty minutes 5 but it is too far indeed it is to be walking quite alone 
let my father's servant go with you 
let me order the carriage 
it can be round in live minutes 
a thank you thank you 
but on no account 
i would rather walk 
and for use to be afraid of walking alone 
i who may so soon have to guard others 
a she spoke with great agitation 
and emma very feeling replied 
a that can he no reason for your being next to danger now 
i must order the carriage 
heat even would be danger 
you are fatigued already a i am a she answered a i am fatigued 
but it is not the sort of fatigue 
quick walking will refresh me 
miss warehouse we all know at times what it is to he wearied in spirits 
mine i confess are exhausted 
thegreatestkindnessyou can show mewillhe to let 1810 sam 
me have my own way and only say that i am gone when it is necessary emma land not another word to oppose 
she saw it all 
and entering into her feelings promoted her quitting the house immediately and watched her safer off with the zeal of a friend 
her ring look was grateful 
and her parting words a i 
miss woodhouae the comfort of being sometimes alone i 
seemed to burst from an overcharged heart 
and to describe now what of the continual endurance to be practised by her even towards some of those who loved her best 
a such a home indeed 
such an aunt 
a aid emma as she turned back into the hall again 
a i do pity you 
all ll more inability you being of their just from the more i shall like you jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour and they has only accomplish some views of st marketplace voice when frank church entered the room 
emma had not been thinking of him 
she had forgotten tothinkofhirn butcher wasverygladtoreehim 
mrs westons would he at ease 
the black mare was blameless 
be were right who had named mr church s the cruel 
he had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her 
4 nervous seizure which had lasted some hours 
and he had quite given up every thought of coming till very late 
and had he known how ho a ride he should have and how late with all his hurry he must he he believed he should not have come at all 
the heat was excessive 
he had never suffered anything like it 
almost wished he had myself at home 
nothing killed him like heat 
he could hear any degree of cold 1814 
but heat was intolerable 
and he sat down at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of mr warehouse s are looking very deplorable 
a you will noon be cooler you sit still a aid emma 
am 12 as soon a i am cooler i shall go back again 
i could very ill be spared but such a point had been made of my coming 
you will all be going soon i suppose 
the whole party breaking up 
i met was i came 
man in such weather l 
absolute madness 
a emma listened and looked and soon perceived that frank churchill’s state might be beat destined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour 
some people were always cross when they were hot 
such might be his constitution 
and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such accidental complaints the recommended his taking some refreshment 
he would find abundance of everything in the dining-room 
and the manner pointed out the door 
a no 
he should not eat 
he was not hungry 
it would only make him better 
in two minutes however he respected in his own favour 
and suffering something about spruce-beer walked or 
emma returned all her attention to her father saying in secret 
a i am glad i am done being in love with him 
i should not like a man who is so soon income by a hat morning 
harris s meet my temper i not mind will he was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal and came back all the better 
grown unite cool and with good manners like himself able to w a chair close to them take an interest in their enjoyment and regret in a reasonable way that he should so late 
he wan not in his best spirit but seemed trying to improve them 
and at last made himself talk nonsense very agreeably 
they were looking over view in switzerland 
a as soon as my aunt gets well i shall go abroad a side 
“ithallneverbeeasytill i heaven some of these places 
you will have my sketch some time 18 sum 
or other to look at 
or my tour to read 
or my power 
i shall do something to expose myself 
a that may be 
but not by matches in switzerland 
you will never go to switzerland 
your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave england a they may be induced to go too 
a warm climate may he prescribed for her 
i have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad 
i assure you i have 
i feel a strong persuasion this morning that i shall soon be abroad 
i ought to travel 
i am tired of doing nothing 
i want a change 
i am serious miss house whatever your entreating eyes may fancy 
i am sick of england would leave it tomorrow if i could a 4 you are sick of prosperity and indulgence 
can not you invent a few hardships for yourself and he contented to stay 2 1 his sick of proper n't and indulged once 
you are quite mistaken 
i do it look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged 
i am thwarted in everything material 
i do not consider myself at all a fortunate person 
you are not quite so miserable though as when you first came 
go and eat and drink a little more and you will do very well 
another spicers of cold meat another daughter of madeira and water will make you near on a part with the rest of us 
oh 
i shall not stir 
i shall sit by you 
you are or heat cure a e are going to box hill tomorrow you will join us 
it is not switzerland but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change 
you will my and go with us 
a no certainly not 
i shall go home in the cool of the evening a but you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning man 
39 no 
it will not worth while 
if i come i shall he cross when my my at richmond but i do i shall hemmed 
icannever hear to think of you all there without me there are difficulties which you must settle for yourself 
choose your own degree of era-incas 
i shall press you no more the rays of the party were now returning and all were soon collected 
with some there wan great joy at the eight of frank church 
other took it very composedly 
but there was a very general distress and disturbance on miss fairfax’s disappearance being explained 
that it was time for everybody to go comic added the subject 
and with a short final arrangement or the next a 18 scheme they parted 
frank churchill’s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much that his last words to emma were 
— yearly 
you wish me to my join the party i w 
she smiled her acceptance 
and nothingness than a summons from richmond was to take him back before the following evening 
chapter 13 
hey had a very line day for box hill 
and all the other outward circumstances of management accommodation and punctuality were in favour of a pleasant party 
mr westons directed the whole obviating safely between hearted and the village and everybody was in good time 
emma and harriet went together 
in bath and her niece with the loud 
the gentlemen on both man woodston 16 runs 
remained with mr warehouse 
nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there 
seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment and everybody had a burst of admiration on first arriving 
but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency 
there was a languor a want of spirits a want of union which could not be got over 
they separated too much into parties 
the elation walked together 
mr nightly took charge of miss gates and jane 
and emma and harriet belonged to frank church 
and mr westons tried in vain to make them harmonised better 
it occurred at him an accidental division but it never materially varied 
mr and mr eton indeed showed no unwillingness to mix and be as agreeable as they could 
but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill there seemed a principle of separation between the other mortifies too strong for any one carpets or any could collation or any cheerful mr son to remove 
at first it was moonlight dullness to emma 
she had never seen frank church so silent and stupid 
he said nothing worth hearing 
looked without seeing admired without intelligence 
listened without knowing what she said 
while he was no dull it was no wonder that harriet should be dull likewise 
and they were both insufferable 
when they all sat down it was better 
to her taste a great deal better 
for frank church grew talkative and gay making her his first object 
every distinguishing attention that could be paid was paid to her 
to amuse her and be agreeable in her eyes seemed all that he cared for 
and emma glad to be enlivened not sorry to be altered my gay and easy too and gave him all the friendly encouragement the admission to be gallant which she had ever given in the rest and most animating period of their acquaintance 
but which now run 
1810 in her own estimation meant nothing though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english word but motion could very well describe 
mr frank church and miss woodhause flirted together excedvely.” they were laying themselves to that very phrase 
and to having it sent 2 in a letter to make grove by one lad to ireland by another 
not that emma was gay an thoughtless from any real felicity 
it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected 
she laughed because the was disappointed 
and though she liked him for his attentions and thought them all whether in friendship admiration or playfulness extremely judicious the were not wanting back her heart 
she still intent eyed him for her friend 
how much i am obliged to you a said he a for telling me to come to-day 
— if it had not been for you 1 should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party 
i had quite determined to go away again yes you were very cross 
and i or not know what about except that you were too late for the best strawberries 
i was a kinder friend than you deserved 
but you were humble 
you begged hard to be commanded to come a doubt nay i was cross 
i was fatigued 
the hat overcame me 
a it is better a-day not to my feelings 
i am perfectly comfortable to-day 
a you are comfortable because you are under commanded a your command 
— 
yes 
perhaps i intended you to any so but i meant self-command 
you had somehow or other broken bounds yesterday 
and run away from your own management 
but today you are got back again 
and an i 16 emma 
can not be always with you it in best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine a it comes to the lame thing 
i can have no self-command without a motive 
you order me whether you speak or not 
and you can he always with me 
you are always with me a darting from three o'clock yesterday 
my perpetual innocence could not begin uglier or you would not have been so much out of humour before three o'clock yesterday 
that is your date 
i thought i had seen you first in for -5 a your gallantry 13 really unaware e. but lowering her voice nobody speaks except ourselves and it in rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment ever silent please a i say nothing of which i am ashamed 1 replied he with lively impudence 
his new you lit in february 
let everybody on the hill hear me if they can 
let my accents swell to wickham on one side and working on the other 
i saw you first in february and then whispering 
a our companions are excessively stupid 
what shall we do to rouse them 
any nonsense will serve 
they shall talk 
ladies and gentlemen i an ordered by miss woodhouae who wherever the is preside to say that the desires to know what you are all thinking of -5 a some laughed and answered good-humouredly 
miss hates wait it great deal 
mrs listen swelled at the idea first warehouse s presiding 
mr knightley’l answer was the most distinct 
a is miss warehouse one that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of 
a oh no no 
a cried emma laughing as carelessly as the could 
a upon no account in the world 
it in the very last thing i would mad the hint of now 
let me hear anything rather than what you are all am 
21 thinking of 
i will not say unite all 
there are one or two perhaps 
glancing at rest and harriet whose thought might not be afraid of knowing 7 a it is a sort of thing 8 cried mrs eton emphatically which i should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into 
though perhaps as the bearer of the party 
i never was in any circle 
exploring parties 
young ladies 
married women 
a her sufferings were chiefly to her husband 
and he murmur in reply 
very true my love very true 
exactly so indeed 
— quite unheard of 
but some ladies a anything 
better pass it is as a joke 
everybody now what is due 101w.” a it will not do a whispered frank to emma then are most of them affronted 
i will attack them with more address 
ladies and gentlemen i am ordered by miss warehouse to say that she saves her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of and only requires something very entertaining from each of you in a general way 
here are seven of you besides myself who she is pleased to my am very entertaining already and she only demands from arch of you either one thing very clever be it prose or verse original or repeated 
or two things immoderately clever 
or three things very dull indeed 
and she engaged to laugh heartily at them all oh 
very well 1 exclaimed miss hates 
a then i need not be uneasy 
these things very dull indeed that will just do for rule you know 
i shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever i open my mouth shan't l 2 1 looking round with the most good 
humoured dependence on everybody assent 
a do not you all think i shall 
emma could not resist 
ah 
ma'am but there may be a difficulty 
pardon 1 38 man 
me but you will be limited as to number 
only three at once mine hates deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner did not immediately catch her meaning 
but when it but 
on her it could not anger though a slight blush showed that it could pain her 
a ah 
well 
to be sure 
you i see what she must turning to mr slightly and i will try to hold my tongue 
i must make myself very disagreeable or the would not have said such a thing to an old friend a i like your plan a cried mr westons 
a agreed agreed 
i will do best 
i am making a conundrum 
how will a conundrum reckon 2 a low i am afraid sir very low 1 answered his son 
a but we shall he indulgent especially to any one who leads the way 
no no a rapid emma 
it will not reckon low 
a conundnnn of mr went shall clear him and his next 
neighbour 
come air pray let me hear it i doubt it being very clever in self laid mr westons 
a it in too much a matter of fact 
but here it in 
what two letter of the alphabet are there that express perfection 2 a what we letters 
express perfection 
i am cure i do not know dab 
you will never guess 
you a to emma 
i am certain will never gum 
i will tell you 
m and a 
emma 
do you understand 
understanding and gratification came together 
it might be a very indifferent piece of wit but emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it and so did frank and harriet 
it did not seem to much the sofa the hall 
some looked it about it and mrpiliayi'geli‘iley grove said 
my up a this explain the sort clever thing that is wanted man 
39 and mr way ha done very well for himself but he must have knocked up everybody clue 
pardon should not have come quite so soon 
oh 
for myself 
detest i must be excused 1 said mrs eton 
a i i can not attempt 
i am not at all fond of the sort of thing 
i had an across once sent to me upon my own name which i won not at all pleased with 
i knew who it came from 
an abominable you 
you know who i mean nodding to her husband by a these kind of things are very well at christmas when one is sitting round the are 
but quite out of place in my opinion when one it exploring about the country in summer 
miss warehouse must excuse me 
i am not one of those who have witty things at everybody service 
i do not pretend to be a wit 
i have a great deal of vivacity in my own way but i really must be allowed judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue 
am up if you please mr church 
page mr e. nightly jane and myself 
we have nothing clever w ray 
not one of us a yes yes my pass m 1 added her husband with a sort of sneering conscious 
i have nothing to say that can entertain miss warehouse or any other young lady 
an old married man 
quite good for nothing 
shall we walk augusta -5 4 with all my heart 
i am rally dread of exploring so long on one spot 
come jane take my other arm jane declined it however and the husband and wife walked out a happy couple l a said frank church as soon as there out of hearing 
how well they suit one another 
very lucky 
marrying as they did upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place 
they only knew each other i think a few week in bath 
peculiarly lucky 
for an to any real knowledge of a personal disposition that bath or any public place can give 
it is all nothing 
there can be no knowledge 
40 tune 
it is only by seeing women in their own homes among their own set just as they always are that you can form any judgment 
short of that it is all guest and luck 
and will generally be ill-luck 
how many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance and ruled it all the rest of his life 
miss fairest who had seldom spoken before except among her own confederates spoke now 
a such things do occur undoubtedly she was stopped by a cough 
frank church turned towards her to listen 
a you were speaking a mind he gravely 
she recovered her voice 
i was onlygoingto observe that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women i can not imagine them to be very frequent 
a party and imprudent attachment ma arise 
but there is generally time to recover from it rewards 
i would be understood to mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters whose happiness must he a ways at the mercy of chance who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience 
in oppression for ever 
he made no answer 
merely looked and bowed in submission 
and soon afterwards said in a lively tone 
a well i have so little confidence in my own judgment that whenever i marry i hope loniclxxly will choose my wife for me 
will you 
a fearing to equal 
will you choose a wife for me 
am sure i should d like anybody fixed on by you 
you provide for the family you know with smile at his father 
find somebody for me 
i am in no hurry 
adopt her 
escape her a and make her like myself a by all means if you can emma 
xli a very well 
i undertake the commission 
you shall have a charming wife a she must be very lively and have hazel eyes 
i care for nothing else 
i shall go abroad for a couple of years 
and when i return i shall come to you for my wife 
remember 
emma was in no danger of forgetting 
it was a commission to touch every favourite feeling 
would not harriet be the very creature described 
hazel eyes excite end two years more i t make her all that he he might even have married in his thoughts at the moment 
who could say 
referring the education to her seemed to imply it 
a now ma'am 1 said one to her aunt 
shall we join mrs eton 
a wife you please my dear 
with all my heart 
i am quite ready 
i was ready to have gone with her but this will do just as well 
we shall soon overtake her 
there she in 
— no that somebody else 
that one of the ladies in the irish card party not at all like her 
well i declare 9 they walked all followed in half a minute by mr nightly 
mr westons his son emma and harriet only remained 
and the young man's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant 
even emma grew tired at last of flattery and men-imam and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others or sitting almost alone and quite unattended to in an toil observation of the beautiful views beneath her 
he appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight 
and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart and the solicitude of mrs westons to have g carriage first were gladly endured in the prospect of the set drive home which was to close the very questionable e enjoyments of this day of pleasure 
such mother scheme composed ll 
t 14 sun 
of so many ill-assorted people she hoped never to he bears end into again 
while waiting for the carriage she found mr nightly by her side 
he looked around an if to see that no one were near and then i 
a emma i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do 
a privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps 
but i must still use it 
i can not see you acting wrong without a remonstrance 
how could you be so unfeeling to miss hates 
how could you be so violent in your wit to a woman of her character age and situation 
emma i had not thought it possible emma recollected blushed was carry but 
tried to laugh it of 
a nay how could i help crying what i did 
nobody could have helped it 
it was not so very bad 
dare lay she did not understand me a i assure you she did 
she felt your full meaning 
she has talked of it since 
i wish you could have heard how she talked of it 
with what ardour and generosity 
i wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions as the was for ever receiving from yourself and your father when her society must be so irksome a oh 
cried emma a i know there in not a better creature in the world 
but you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her they are blended 1 said he is acknowledge 
and were the prosperous i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good 
were she a woman of fortune i would leave every harmless absurdity no take its chance 
i would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner 
were she your equal in situation but emma consider how far burnt 13 this in from being the case 
she is poor 
she has sunk from the comfort she was born to 
and if she live to old age must probably sink more 
her situation should secure your companion 
it was hardly done indeed 
you whom she had known from an infant whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour 
to have you now in thought spirits and the pride of the moment laugh at her humble heard before her niece too 
and before them many of whom certainly more would be entirely guided bylawtreatmcnt of her 
this is not pleasant to you emma 
and it is very far from plenty to me 
but i must i will 
i will tell you truths while i can 
satisfied with proving myself your friend very faithful counsel and fixing that you will some time other do me greater justice than you can do now 
while they talked they were advancing toward 
the carriage 
it was ready 
and before she could speak again he had handed her in 
he had misinterpreting the feelings which had kept her face averted and her tongue motionless 
they were confined only of anger against herself mortification and deep concern 
she had not 
been able to speak 
and on entering the carriage sunk back for a moment overcome 
then reproaching herself for having taken no leave making no acknowledgement passing in apparent idleness she looked out with voice and hand eager to show a difference 
but it was just too late 
he had turned away and the horses were in motion 
she continued to look back but in vain 
and soon with what asp unusual speed they were half way down the hill and everything left far behind 
she was vexed beyond what could have been expressed 
almost beyond what she could conceal 
never had she felt so agitated mortified grieved at any circumstance in her life 
44 man 
she wan most forcibly melt 
the truth of his representation there wan no denying 
she felt it at her heart 
how could she have been so brute no comes to miss hates 
how could she have formed herself to such ill opinion in any one the use 
and how suffer him to leave her without laying one word of gratitude of concurrence of common kindness 
time did not compose her 
all the selected more the seemed but to feel it more 
she never had been so pressed 
ha imply it was not necessary to there was only bennet who seemed not in spirits herself engaged and very willing to he silent 
and emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home without being at any trouble to check them extraordinary as they were 
than 1814 
he wretchedness of a scheme to box hill was in emma thoughts all the evening 
how it might be considered by the rear 
of the party she could not tell 
they in their different homes and their different ways might be looking back on it with pleasure 
but in her view it was a morning more completely missent more totally hare of rational satisfaction at the time and more to he abhorred in recollection than any the had ever passed 
a whole evening of backgammon with her father was felicity to it 
t indeed lay real pleasure for there the was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty 
four to his comfort 
and feeling that unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and considering esteem she could not in her general conduct be open to any severe reproach 
emma 
-5 as a daughter she hoped she was not without a heart 
she hoped no one could have said to her a how could you be so unfeeling to your father 
— 
i must i will tell you truths while i can miss beat should never again 
no never 
if attention in future could do away the past she might hope to be forgiven 
she had been often remiss her conscience told her to 
remiss perhaps more in thought than fact 
campful uogmcioua 
but it should he so no more 
in the warmth of true contrition she would call upon her the very next meaning and it should he the beginning 
on her side of a regular equal kindly intercourse 
she was just as determined when the morrow came and went early that nothing might prevent her 
it was not unlikely she thought that she might see mr nightly in her way 
or perhaps he might come in while she were paying her visit 
she had no objection 
she would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence so justly and truly hers 
her eyes were toward well a she walked but she as him not 
6 the ladies were all at home she had never rejoiced at the sound before nor ever before entered the passage nor walked up the stairs with any wish of giving pleasure but in conferring obligation or of deriving it except in subsequent ridicule 
there wasabustle on her reach 
a goodness of moving and talking 
she him miss hates voice 
something was to be done in a hurry 
the maid looked frightened and awkward 
hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment and then ushered her in too soon 
the aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the dining room 
jane the had a distinct glimpse of looking extremely ill 
and before the door had shut them out she heard miss hates saying a well m dear i shall my you are laid down upon the bed and am sure you are ill you a 16 runs 
poor old man hates civil and humble as usual looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on 
a i am afraid jane is not very well a aid the but i do not know 
they tell me she is well 
i dare say my daughter will be here presently miss woodhonee 
i hope you and s chair 
i wish my had not gone 
i am very little able 
have you a chair manand 
do you sit where you like 
i am fresher will be here presently 
emma seriously hoped she would 
she had a moment s fear of miss hates keeping away from her 
but miss yates soon came 
a very happy and in a 
— but emma conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before 
less ease of look and manner 
a very friendly inquiry after miss fairest she hoped might lead the way to a return of old feelings 
the touch seemed immediate 
a ah miss warehouse how kind you are 
i suppose you have heard 
and are come to give or joy 
this does not seem much like joy indeed in me tinkling away a tear or two 
but it will be very trying for us to part with her after having had her so long 
and she has a dreadful headache just now writing all the blooming 
such long letters you know to be written in colonel campbell and mrs diction 
a my dear a said i a you will blind yourself a for tears were in her eyes perpetually 
one can not wonder one can not wonder 
it is a great change 
and though she in amazingly fortunate 
such a situation i suppose as no young woman before ever met 
with on first going out 
do not think its ungrateful miss warehouse for such surprising good fortune 1 again dispersing her ears 
a but poor dear soul 
if you were to see what a head the has 
when one is in great pain you know one can not feel any blessing quite as it may deserve 
she runs 
47 is as low as possible 
to look at her nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation 
you will excuse her not coming to you 
she is not able she is gone into her own room 
i want her to lie down upon the bed 
my dear a said i shall iayyouarelaid down upon the bed 
a but however she is not 
she is walking about the room 
but now that she has written her letters she says she shall soon be well 
she will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you miss warehouse but your kind will excuse her 
you were kept waiting at the door i was quite ashamed 
but somehow there was a little bustle 
forty happened that we had not heard the knock 
and till you were on the stairs we did not know anybody was coming 
a it is only mrs close a said i depend upon it 
nobody else would come so early 
— a well a aid she it must be borne some time or other and it may as well be now but then petty carter and said it was you 
only said i it is miss warehouse i am sure you will like to see her a 
a i can see nobody 1 said she and up she got and would go away 
and that was what made us keep you waiting 
and extremely sorry and ashamed we were 
a if you must go my dear a said i you must and i will say you are laid down upon the bed 1 emma was most sincerely interested 
her heart had been long growing kinder towards jane 
and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion and left her nothing but pity 
and the remembrance of the less and less gentle sensations of the past obliged her to admit that one might very naturally resolve on seeing mrs cold or any other steady friend when she might not bear to see herself 
she spoke as she felt with earnest regret and solicitude 
sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from miss hates to be now actually 18 emma 
determined on might be as much for miss fairfax’a advantage and comfort as possible 
it munbeasevcretrialwthemall 
shehadun 
deemed it was to be delayed till colonel campbell rum 
so varying 
repliedmisabates 
but your always kind there was bearing such an always 
and to break through her dreadful multitude emma made the direct inquiry of 
a where may i ask is miss fairest going 21 to a mrs smallridge 
charming woman 
most superior 
to have the charge of her three little girl 
— delightful children 
impossible that any question could be more replete with comfort if we expect perhaps mrs suckling’a own family and mrs dragged s 
but mrs smullridgc is intimate with both and in the very same neighbourhood 
lives only four miles from male grove 
jane will be only four miles from male grove 
a mrs westons i suppose has been the person to whom miss fairest owes 
7 a yes our good mrs eton 
the man indefatigable true friend 
she would not take a denial 
she would not let jane say a no 
a for when jane first heard of it it was the day before yesterday the very morning we were at dwell when jane first heard of it she was quite decided against accepting the fair and for the reasons you mention 
exactly as you say she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel campbell return and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present 
and so she told mrs eton over and over again 
and i am sure i had no more idea that she would change her mind 
— but that good mrs eton whose judgement never fails her saw farther than i did 
it is not everybody that would emma 
49 have stood out in such a kind way as she did and refuse to take janehis answer 
but she positively declared she would so 
write any such denial yesterday as jane wished her 
she would wait 
and sure enough yesterday evening it was all settled that jane should go 
quite as tiresome 
had not the leastideal 
jane took i westons aside and told her at once that upon thinkingover the advantages of mrs smallhridge s situation she had come to the resolution of meeting it 
i did not know a word of it till it was all settled 1 you spent the evening with mrs eton 21 a yes all of us 
mr ellison would have us come 
it was settled so upon the hill while we were walking about with mr knighrley. you am 
all spend your evening with us a said she 
a i positive must have you all come a 
mr nightly was there too was he 
a 5 no not mr nightly 
he declined it from the first 
and though i thought he would come because mrs eton declared she would not let him if he did not 
but my mother and jane and i were all there and a very agreeable evening we had 
such kind friends you know miss warehouse one must always and agreeable though everybody seemed rather fading after the morning party 
even pleases you know is fatiguiug~and i can not say that any of them seemed much to have enjoyed it 
however i shall always think it a very pleasant party and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me i l a miss fair i suppose though you were not aware of it had been taking up her mind the whole day 2 4 
i dare say she had a whenever the time may come it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends 
but i hope her engagement 200 runs 
will have every alleviation that is puddles 
i mean as to the character and manners of the family 
a thank you dear miss warehouse 
yes indeed there is everything in the world that can make her happy in it 
except the stockings and begged there is not such another nursery embellishment so liberal and elegant in all mrs westons acquaintance 
mrs smallridge a most delightful woman 
a style of living almost equal to ma leg grove 
and as to the children except the little gucklings and little bigger there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere 
jane will he tinged with such regard and kindness 
it will be nothing but pleasure 
a life of pleasure 
and her solitary 
i really can not venture to name her safety to you miss warehouse 
even you used as you are to great cuts would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like jane a ah madam 8 cried emma a if other children are at all like what i remember to have been metcalf 
i should think live times the amount of what i have ever yet heard named as a alarm on such occasions dearly earned 4 you are so noble in your idea 5 and when in miss fair to leave you 
7 a very soon very soon indeed 
that the worst of it 
within a fortnight 
mrs smallridge is in a great hurry 
my poor mother does not know how to bear it 
so then i try to put it out of her thoughts and say a come madam do not let us think about it any more 
a her friends must all be sorry to lose her 
and will not colonel and mrs campbell be sorry to and that she has engaged herself before their return 
a yes 
jane you she is sure they will 
but yet this is such a situation as she can not feel herself justified in declining 
i was so astonished when the first told me what she had been saying to mrs easton and when mrs mea 
15 clifton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it 
it was before tea 
stay 
no it could not be before tea because we were just going to cards 
and yet it was before tea because i remember thinking 
oh no now i recollect now i have it something happened before tea but not that 
mr clifton was called out of the room before tea old john abyss son wanted to speak with him 
poor old john 
i have a great regard for him 
he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven years 
and now poor old man he is brigden and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joining 
i rang and him to 
day and so will jane i am sure if she gets out at all 
and poor john nor came to talk to mr westons about relief from the parish he in very well-to-do himself you know being head man at the crown 
order and everything of that sort 
but still he can not keep his father without come help 
and so when mr eton came back he told us what john butler had been telling him and then it came out about teach having been sent to recall to take mr frank church to richmond 
that was what happened before tea 
it war after tea that jane grain to mr eton 
miss yates would hardly give emma timetoaayhow perfectly new this circumstance was to her 
but a without says it possible that she could be ignorant of any s the particulars of mr frank churchill’s going her end to give them all it was of no consequence 
hat mr clifton had learned from the bustle on the subject being the accumulation of the ottler’a own knowledge and the knowledge of the servants at rascally was that a messenger had come over from richmond soon after the return often party from box hill 
which messenger however had been no more than was next and 
and that mr church had sent his nephew 3 few lines containing upon the whole a tolerable acted emma 
count of mrs church and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early 
but that mr frank church having resolved to go home directly without waiting at all and hit horse seeming to have got a cold tom had been sent of immediately for the crown chaise and the older had stood out and seen it use by the boy going a good pace and driving very there was nothing in all thin either to astonish or interest and it caught emma attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind 
the contrast between mr church s importance in the world and jane fairfax’a struck her 
one was everything the other nothing 
and the sat musing on the difference of woman's denny and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed till roused by miss hates saying 
may i see what you are thinking of the pianoforte 
what is to become of that 
very time 
poor dear jane wan talking of it just now 
you must go a said the 
you and i must part 
you will have no business here 
let it may however a said she 
a give it house-room till colonel campbell comes back 
i shall talk about it this 
hewillaettleforme 
hewillbelpmeout of all my diflicultiee.’ and to this day i do believe she knows not whether it was his present or his daughters now sum was obliged to think of the pianoforte 
and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was no little pleasing that the noon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough 
and with a repetition of everything that she could endure to say of the good wishes which the rally felt took leave 
sums 
15 that 17 
mass pensive meditations as she walked home were not interrupted 
but on entering the parlour she found those who must rouse her 
mr slightly and harriet had arrived during her absence and were sitting with her father 
m nightly immediately got up and in a manner decidedly graver than usual said 
i would not go away without seeing you but i have no time to were and therefore must now be gone directly 
i am going to london to spend a few days with john and isabella 
have you anything to send or say besides the love a which nobody carries 
a nothing at all 
but is not this a sudden scheme 2 7 a yes 
rather 
i have been thinking of it some little time emma was sure he had not forgiven her 
he looked unlike himself 
time however she thought would tell him that they ought to be friends again 
while he stood as if meaning to go but not going 
her father began his inquiries 
well my dear and did you get there sale -5 
and how did you and my worthy old friend an her daughter l 
i dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming dear emma has been to call on mr and miss hates mr slightly as i told you before 
she is always so attentive to them emma colour was heightened by this unjust praise 
and with a smile and shake of the head which spoke much she looked at mr nightly 
it seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour as if his eyes received the truth from hers and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and 10 emma 
honoured 
he looked at her with a glow of regard 
she was warm gratitude 
and in another moment still more so by a style movement of more than common friendliness on his rut 
he took her hand 
— whether she had not herself made the first motion she could not lay 
she might perhaps have rather offered it 
but he took her hand pressed it and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips 
when from some fancy or other he suddenly let it go 
why he should feel such a scruple why he should change his mind when it was all but done she could not receive 
he would have judged better she thought he had not stopped 
the intention however was indubitable 
and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry 
or however else it happened but she thought nothing became him more 
it was with him of so simple yet so dignified a nature 
she could not but recall the attempt with great satisﬁcn'on 
it spoke such perfect amity 
he left them immediately afterwards 
gone in a moment 
he always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance 
emma could not regret her having gone to miss hates but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier 
— 
it would have been a great ensure to talk over jane fairﬁrx'l situation with 1 nightly 
neither would she regret that he should be going to benwick squares for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed 
but it might have happened at a better time 
and to have had longer notice of it would have been pleasanter 
they parted thorough friends however 
she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance and his unpunished flattery 
— it was all done to assure her that she had my recovered his good opinion 
he had been sitting with them half an emma 
15 hour she bound 
it was a pity that she had not come back earlier 
in the hope of diverting her father's thoughts from the agreeableness of mr knighdey’s going to london and going so suddenly and going on horseback which she knew would be all very bad emma communicated her news of jane fair and her dependence on the effect was justified 
it supplied 3 ve useful check 
interested without disturbing him 
age had long made up his mind to jane fairfax’s going out as governess and could talk of it cheerfully but mr knightley’s going to london had been an unexpected blow 
a i am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so comfortably settled 
mrs westons is very good-natured and agreeable and i dare say her acquaintance are what they ought to he 
i hope it is a dry situation and that her health will be taken good care 
it ought to he a first object as i am sure poor miss taylor always was with me 
you know my dear she is going to he to this new lady what miss taylor was to us 
and i hope she will be better of in one respect and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long 
the following day brought news from richmond to throw everything else into the background 
au express lived at random to announce the death of mrs church 
though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten hack on her account she had not lived above five-and-thirty hours after his return 
a sudden seizure of a different nature from anything forwarded by her general state had carried her off after a short struggle 
the great mrs church was no more 
it was felt as such things must he felt 
everybody had a degree of gravity and sorrow 
tenderness towards the departed solicitous for the surviving friends 
and in a reasonable time curiosity to know where she would 16 blue 
be buried 
goldsmith tell 
us that when lovely woman hopes to folly she has nothing to do but to die 
and when the hopes to he disagreeable it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-usage 
mr. church after being disliked at least twenty-seven years wan now keys of with compassionate allowances 
in one point was fully justified 
she had never been admitted before to be verily ill 
the event acquitted her of all the fancifulneas and all the selfishness of imaginary complaint 
poor mrs church 
no doubt the had been suffering a great deal more than anybody had ever supposed 
and continual pain would try the temper 
it was a sad event 
1 great shock 
with all her faults what would mr church do without her 
mr churchill’s long would he readily indeed 
mr church would never get over it 
even mr westons shook his head and looked solemn and said ah poor woman who would have thought it 
a and resolved that he mourning should be as handsome as possible 
and his wife at sighing and moralizing over her broad home with a consideration and good sense tone and steady 
how it would act frank was among the earliest thoughts of both it was also a very early i station with emma 
the character of my chill the grief of her husband 
her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion 
and then rested with lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event how benefited how feed 
she as in a moment all the possible good 
now an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter 
mr church independent of his wife was feared by nobody 
an easy suitable man to be persuaded into anything by his nephew 
all that remained to he wished was that the nephew should form the attachment as with all her good-will in the came emma 17 emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed 
harriet behaved extreme well on the occasion 
with great self-command 
however she might feel of brighter hope she betrayed nothing 
emma was gratitude to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character and refrained from any allusion that i hat endanger its maintenance 
thensome therefore of rschurchill’s death with mutual forbearance 
short letters from frank were received at rascally communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans 
mr church was borne than could be expected 
and their first removal on the departure of the funeral for yorkshire was to be to the house of a old friend in window to whom mr church hailergeen promising a visit the last ten years 
hum 
there was nothing to be done for amid 
g wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on emma side 
it was a more pressing concern to show attention to jane fairest whose prospect were closing while harriet opened and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at highly who wished to show her kindness 
and with emma it was grown into 3 him wish 
she had scarcely a stronger regret than other plan coldness 
and the person whom she had been so many months neglecting was now the very one on whom she would have wished every distinction of regard or sympathy 
she wanted to be of use to her 
wanted to show a value for her society and testify t and consideration 
she resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at hatfield 
a note was written to urge it 
the invitation was refused and by a verbal message 
miss fairest was not well you he to write 
a and when mr parry called at parties the use morning it appeared that she was so much in 
l 1 38 emma 
disposed astohavebeeovilited thmrghaainsther own consent by himself and that the war 
suffering under severe heads and a nervous fever m a degree which made him doubt the possibility of her going to mrs smallridge’s at the time proposed 
her health seemed for the moment completely deranged 
appetite quite gone 
and though there were no absolutely alarming sam tom nothing touching the one so at which was the standing 2 when-idling that my mr party was uneasy about 
he thought she had undertaken more than shew half w and that the felt it so herself though she wo d not own it 
her spirits seemed overcome 
her present home he could not but observe 38 
unfavourable to a nervous disorder 
— colonel always to one room 
— he could have wished it otherwise 
— -and her good aunt though his very old friend he must acknowledge to be not the best compassion for an invalid of that description 
her care and attention could not he questioned 
they were in fact onlysome great 
he very much feared that miss fairest derived more evil than good from them 
emma listened with the warmest concern 
grieved for her more and more and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful 
to take her 
he it only an hour or two 
from her aunt to give her change of air and scene and quiet rational conversation even for an hour or 
two might do her good 
and the following morning she wrote again to say in the most feeling language she could command that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that jane would name 
mentioning that the had mr parry decided opinion in favour of such exercise for his patient 
the answer was only in this short note 
a miss fairest compliments and thanks but is quite unequal to any exercise 
emma felt that her own now had deserved something moan 
49 better 
butitwasimposlihletoquarrel with words whose tremulous inequality showed disposition so plainly and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assist 
in spite of the answer therefore the ordered the carriage and drove to mrs yates's in the hope that jane would be induced to join her 
but it would not do 
— 
miss hates came to the carriage door all gratitude and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service 
and everything that message could do was tried 
but all in vain 
miss yates was obliged to return withontjnrccess 
jane was quite unpersuadable 
the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse 
emma wished she could have seen her and tried her own powers 
but almost before she could hint the wish miss hates made it a rap that she had promised her niece on no account to let woodhousc in 
a indeed the truth was that poor dear jane could not hear to see an body 
anybody at all 
mrs eton indeed could not he denied 
and mrs cold had made such a point 
and mrs party had said so much 
but except them jane would really see nobody emma did not want in be classed with the mrs westons the mrs parrys and the mrs copses who would force themselves anywhere 
neither could she feel any right of preference herself 
she submitted therefore and only questioned miss careys farther as to her niece coming and dirt which she longed to be able to assist 
no that subject poor miss yates was very unhappy and very communicative 
jane would hardly at anything 
mr parry recommended flourishing food 
but everything the could command and never had anybody such good neighbours was distaste 
emma on reaching home called the housekeeper directly to an examination of her stories 
and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily 16 emma 
watched to miss pales with a most friendly note 
in half an hour the arrowroot was returned with a thousand thanks from miss hates but a dear jane would not be satisfied without its being out back 
it was a thing she could not take 
and moreover she insisted on her saying that she was not at all in want of anything when emma afterwards heard that jane fairest had been seen wandering about the meadows at some is once from highly on the afternoon of the very day on which she had under the plea of being unequal to any exercise so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage she could have no doubt 
putting everything together 
that jane was resolved to receive no kindness from bars 
she was sorry very sorry 
her heart was grieved for a state which centred but the more pitiable from this sort of imitation of spirits inconsistency of action and inequality of powers 
and it most 
led her that she was given so little credit fordprorr feeling or esteemed so little worthy as a friend at she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good and of being able to my to herself that could mr nightly have been privy to all her attempts of assisting jane fairest could he even have seen into her heart he would not on this occasion have found anything to prove 
cost 1785 
he morning about ten days after mr churchill’s decease emma was called downstairs to mr westons who 1 could not stay live minutes and wanted particularly to speak with her 
he met her at the parlour-door and hardly asking her how she did in the natural key of his voice sunk it immediately to say unheard by her father 
emma 
11 can you come to handle at any time thin morning 
do if it be possible 
mrs westons want 
to see you 
she must see you 
2 in the unwell 8 no no 
not at all 
only a little agitated 
she would have ordered the carriage and come to you but she must see you aim and that you know nodding toward her father 
— humph 
can you come 
7 a certainly 
it moment if you please 
it is impossible to refuse what you ask in wet a way but what can be the matter 
is she really not ill 21 a depend upon me 
but ask no more quem'onr 
you will know it all in time 
the most suitable business but hush hush 
a to guess what all this meant war impossible even for emma 
something really important seemed announced by his look 
but an her friend was well the endeavoured not to be uneasy and settling it with her father that she would take her walk now she and mr westons were soon out of the house together and on their way at a sick pace for scandal 
a now a mind emma when they were fairly beyond the sweep gay now mr wrong do let me know what has happened 5 no no 4 he gravely replied 
a doubt ask me 
i promised my wife to leave it all to her 
she will break it to you better than i can 
do not impatient emma 
it will all come out too soon a break it to me 
a cried emma standing still with terror 
a good god 
mr westons tell me at once 
something has ha end in benwick square 
i know it has 
to me i charge you tell me this moment what it in 
a no indeed you are mistaken 
mr westons do not trifle with me 
consider how many of my dearest friends are now in benwick 16 emma 
square 
which of them is it 
i charge you by all that in sacred not to attempt concealment 
a upon my word emma 
your word 
why not your honour 
why not say upon your honour that it has nothing to do with any of them 
good heavens 
what can he to he hole to me that does not relate to one of that family -5 
a upon my honour 1 said he very serious it does not 
it is not in the smallest d reel connected with any human being of the name of nightly 1 emma s courage reared and she walked on 
a i was wrong 4 he continued in talking of its being built to you 
i should not have used the expression 
in fact it does not concern you it concerns only myself 
— that is we hope 
humph 
— in short my dear emma there is no occasion to he so uneasy about it 
i doubt say that it is not a disagreeable business but think might be much wanted 
if we walk fast 
we shall soon he at randalla.” emma found that the must wait 
and now it required little effort 
she asked no more uem'oun therefore meetly employed her own fancy and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money chances 
anything just come to light of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family 
something which the late event at richmond had brought forward 
her fancy was very active 
half a dozen natural children perhaps and poor frank cut of 
this though ve undesirable e wo d be no matter of agony to her 
it in red little more than an animating curiosity 
a ho is that gentleman on horseback 
a said the as they proceeded 
speaking more to assist mr won in keeping his secret than with an other view 
a i do not know 
one of the way 
not frank it is not frank i assure you 
you will not see him 
he is half way to window by this time 
mr 
6 “hasyoursonbeenwith you then 
7 a oh 
yes did not you know 
well well never mind for moments was silent 
and then added in a tune much more guarded and demure 
— 
yes frank came over this morning 
just to ask us how we did they hurried on and were speedily at rascally 
a well my dear a said he as they entered the room i have brought her and now i hope on will loan be better 
i shall leave you together 
here is no use in delay 
i shall not be far off if you want one 
— and emma distinctly heard him add in a. lower tone before he quitted the room 
a i have been as good an my word 
she he not the least dear mrs westons was looking so ill and had an air of so much moon that means uneasiness increased and the moment they were alone she eagerly mild 
— a what is it my dear friend 
something of a very unpleasant nature i and has occurred 
— 
do let me know directly what it is 
i have been walking all this way in complete opened 
we both abhor suspense 
do not let mine continue longer 
it will do you good to speak of your distress whatever it may be gave you indeed no idea 
a said mrs won in a trembling voice 
can not you my dear emma 
can not you form a guess as to what you are to hear 2 7 a so far a that it relates to mr frank churdrill i do guessed you are right 
it does relate to him and i will tell you directly 
a resuming her work and seeming resolved against looking up 
4 he has been here this very morning 
on a most extraordinary errand 
it is impossible to explore our surprise 
he came to speak 16 emma 
to his father on a subject 
to announce an attachment 
no she stopped to breathe 
emma thought rest of herself and then of harriet 
more than an attachment indeed hemmed man woodston a an engagement 
a positive engagement 
what will you any emma 
what will anybody say 
when it in known that frank church and miss fairest are engaged 
nay that they have been long engaged 2 emma even jumped with nil-prise 
and horror-struck exclaimed 
jane fairest 
good god 
you are not action 
you do not mean it 
a you may well be amazed a returned mrs westons nail 
averting her eyes and talking on with eagerness that emma might have time to recover 
a you may well be amazed 
but it in even so 
there ha been a solemn engagement between them ever since october 
formed at weymouth and kept a secret from everybody 
not a creature knowing it but themselves 
neither the campbell nor her family nor his 
it in so wonderful that though perfectly convinced of the fact it it yet almost incredible to myself 
i can hardly believe it 
i thought i knew him emma scarcely heard what was said 
her mind was divided between two ideas 
her own former convenathan with him about miss fair and poor harriet 
and for some time she could only exclaim and require confirmation tied confirmation 
well 
a said she at last 1 in to recover herself this is a circumstance which must think of at least half a day before i can at all comprehend it 
what 
— engaged to her all the winter 
before either of them came to highly 
a engaged since october 
secretly engaged 
it has emma 
-5 hurt me emma very much 
it has hurt his father equally 
some part 
of his conduct we can not excuse emma pondered a. moment and then replied 
i will not pretend no 
to understand you 
and to give an all the relief in my power be assured that no such e t has followed his attentions me as you are apprehensive of 
mr westons looked up afraid to believe 
but emma countenance was as steady as her words 
that you may have less difficult in believing this boast of my present perfect indifference 6 the continued a i will farther tell you that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance when i did like him 
when i was very much disposed to be asked to him 
nay was attached 
and how it came to cease perhaps the wonder 
fortunately however it did ease 
i have really for some time past 
for at least these three months 
read nothing about him 
you may believe me mrs westons 
this is the simple truth mrs westons kind her with tears of joy 
and when she could and utterance amuse her that this protestation had done her more good than anything else in the world could do 
mr westons will be almost as much relieved as myself a said she 
5 on this point we have been wretched 
it was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other and we were persuaded that it was so 
imagine what we have been feeling on your account 
i have escaped 
and that i shoulders marble matter of grateful wonder to you and myself 
but this does not acquit bind mrs westons 
and i must say that i think him greatly to blame 
what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged and with manner so every disengaged 
what right had he to endeavour to please 4 he certainly did 
to distinguish i 16 emma 
any one young woman with persevering mention as he certainlyzlid while he really belonged to another 
how could he tell what mischief he might be doing 
how could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him 
very wrong very wrong indeed 
from something that he said my dear emma i rather imagine 
— a and how could the hear such behaviour 
compare with a witness 
to look on while attentions were offering to another woman before her face and not recent it 
that is a degree of alacrity which i can neither comprehend nor respect 
there were mixrmdemandin between them emma 
he said so expressly 
e had not time to enter into much explanation 
he we here only a quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay 
but that there had been misunderstanding he decidedly laid 
the present cross indeed seemed to be brought on by them 
and those misunderstanding might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct 
impropriety 
oh 
mrs westons it is too calm in censure 
much much beyond impropriety 
it has sunk him 
i can not say how it has sunk him in my opinion 
so unlike what a man should be 
none of that upright integrity that strict deference to truth and principle that again of trick and littleness which half man should display in every transaction of his em a nay dear emma now i must take his part 
for though he has been wrong in this instance i have known him long enough to answer for his having many very many good qualities 
an 7 a good god 
cried emma not attending to her a man smllridge too 
jane actually on the not of going as governess 
what could he mean my such must 
11 horrible indelicacy 
to suffer her to engage herself 
to suffer her even to thinkofsuch a measure 
a 4 he knew nothing about it emma 
on this article i can frailty acquit him 
it was a private resolution of hen not communicated to him or at least not communicated in a w to carry conviction 
till yesterday know herdhewasiuthedarkattoher plans 
burst on him i do not know how but by some letter or message 
and it was the discovery of what she was doing of this very project of hers which determined him to come forward at once own it all to his uncle throw himself on his kindness and in short put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long 
emma began to listen better 
a i am to hear from him soon continued mrs westons 
he told me at parting that he should soon write 
and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now 
let us wait therefore for this letter 
it may bring many extenuation 
it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood 
does let us be severe 
does let us be in a hurry to condemn him 
let us have patience 
i must love him 
and now that i am satisfied on one point the one material point i am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well and rude hope that it may 
they must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secrecy and concealment this suffering a replied emma drily 1 do not appear to have done him much harm 
well and how did mr church take it 
7 a most favourably for his nephew 
gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty 
conceive what the events of a week have done in that family 
while poor mrs church lived i suppose there could not have been a 16 emma 
hope a chance a pot-’hility 
but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault than her husband is end to act exactly opposite to what she would have tired 
what a blessing it in when undue influence not survive the grave 
he gave his content with very little persuasion ah 
thought emma she would have done much for harriet 1 this was settled at night and frank was of with the light this morning 
he stopped at highly at the latest i fancy some time and then came on hither 
but was in such a hurry to get back to hit uncle to whom he is just now more necessary than ever tbagaaitellymnheconld wayswith us but a quarter of an hour 
he was very much agitated 
very much indeed 
to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from anything i had ever seen him before 
in addition to all the rest there had been the shock of sending her so very unwell which he had had no previous opinion of and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great dusk and do you really believe the fair to have been marrying on with such perfect secrecy 
the campbell the extent 
did none of them know of the engagement 
a emma could not speak the name of iron without a little blush 
none 
not one 
he positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves a well 1 said emma a i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea and i with them very happy 
but i shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding 
what has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceitful parsonage and treachery 
to come among us with professions of openness and emma 
49 simplicity 
and such a lease in secret to judge us all 
here have we been the whole winter and spring completely duped fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour with two people in the midst of on who may have been carrying round 
comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear 
they must take the consequence if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable l am unite easy on that head a replied mr westons 
a am very cure that i never said anything of either to the other which both might not have heard 
you are in luck 
your only blunder was contented to my ear when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady true 
but an i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of mine fairest i never could under an blunder have spoken ill of her 
and as to speaking of him there i must have been safe at thin moment mr easton appeared at a little distance from the window evidently on the watch 
his wife gave him a look which invited him in 
and while he was coming round added 
a now dearest emma let me entreat you to say and look everything that may let his heart at care and incline him to be satisfied with the match 
let us make the bent of it 
and indeed almost everything may be fairly aid in her favour 
it in not a connexion to gratify 
but if mr church does not feel that why should we 
and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him 
for frank i mean 
that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judge meat as i have always given her credit for and still am to give her credit for in spite of thin one great deviation from the strict rule of right 
and how much may laid in her situation for even that error 
a 16 runs 
much indeed 
a cried emma feelingly 
if a woman never be excused for thinking only of herself it is in a situation like jane f airfax’e 
of such one may always a that a the world is not theirs nor the world law a she met mr woodston on his entrance with a smiling countenance exclaiming 
a very pretty trick you havebeen playing me upon word 
thin was a device i suppose to sport with my curiosity and exercise my talent of guessing 
but you really lightened me 
i thought you had lost half your property at least and here instead of its being a matter of condolence it turn 
out to be one of congratulation 
i congratulate you mr weeks with all the heart on the prospect of having one of the most i x love and accomplished young women in england for a your daughter a glance or two between him and hit wife convinced him that all was a right as this speech proclaimed 
and in happy election his spirits was immediate 
his air and voice recovered their usual brisker 
he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand and entered on the subject in a manner to prove that he now only wanted time and operation to think the engagement no very bad thing 
his companions suggested only what could alliance or smooth objections 
and by the time they had talked it all over together and he bad talked it all over again with emma in their walk back to hatfield he was become perfectly reconciled and not far from thinking it the very best thing that frank could possibly have done 
mr 
17 than 11 
a married poor harriet 
those were the words 
in them lay the tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of and which continued theoretical misery of the manner to her 
frank church had behaved very ill by herself 
very ill in many ways 
but it was not so much lip behaviour as her own which made her so angry with him 
it was the scrape which he had drawn her into one habits account that gave the deepest hue to his offence 
poor harriet 
to be a second time the dupe of her misconception and matter 
mr nightly had spoken prophetically when he once said a emma you have been no friend to harriet srnith.” 
she was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice 
it was true that she had not to charge herself this instance as in the former with being the sole and original author of the mischief with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered harriet imagimﬁon 
for harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of frank church before she had evergreen hers hint on the subject 
but she felt complete guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed 
she might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments 
her influence would have been enough 
and now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them 
she felt that she had been risking her friends happiness on most insufficient grounds 
common sense would have directed her to tell harriet that she must not allow herself to think of him and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her 
— a but with common sense she added a i am afraid i have had little to do 
i 7 2 emma 
she was extreme angry with herself 
if she could not have been angry with frank church too it would have been dreadful 
as for jane fairest 
she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account 
harriet would he anxiety enough 
she need no longer be unhappy about jane whose troubles and whose ill health having of course the same origin must be equally under cure 
her days of insignificance and evil were over 
she would soon be well and happy and prospects 
emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted 
this discovery laid many smaller matters open 
no doubt it had been from jealousy 
in james eyes she had been a rival 
and well might anything she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed 
an airing in the hated marriage would have been the rocks and arrowroot from the hatfield store-room must have been poison 
she understood it all 
and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings she acknowledged that jane fairest would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert 
but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge 
there was little sympathy to be spared for anybody else 
emma was hardly fearful that this second disappointment would be more more than the first 
considering the very superior claim of the object it ought 
and judging by in apparently stronger effect on harriet mind producing reserve and self-command it would 
she must communicate the painful truth however and as soon as possible 
an injunction of secrecy had been among 1 westons parting words 
for the present the whole affair was to be completely secret 
mr church had made a point of it as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost 
and everybody admitted it to be no more than due decorum 
emma had promised 
but still harriet must be excepted 
it was her superior duty 
emma 
49 in spite of her vexation the could not help feeling it almost ridiculous that she should have the very same directing and delicacy face to perform by harriet which mrs westons had just gone through by herself 
the intelligence which had been no anxious announced to her she was now to he anxiously announcing to another 
her heart beat quick on hearing harriet footsteps and voice 
no she supposed had poor mrs westons felt when -5 was approaching rascally could the event of the disclosure hear an equal resemblance 
— but of that unfomrnahely there could be no chance 
well miss woodhousc 8 cried harriet coming eagerly into the room 
in not this the oddest news that ever was 
a what new do you mean 
a replied emma unable to guess by look or voice whether harriet could indeed have received any hint 
a about jane fairest 
did you ever hear anything so manage 
oh 
— you need not be afraid of owning it to me for mr westons has told me himself 
i met himjust 
he told me itwaetobe a great secret 
and therefore i should not think of mentioning it to anybody but you but he said you knew it that did mr westons tell you 
a said emma still perplexed 
a oh 
he told me all about it 
am jane fair and mr frank church are no he married and that have been rival an end to one another this it 
while 
hon veryyoddgla’g’ it was indeed so odd 
harriet behaviour was so extremely odd that emma did not know how to demand it 
her character appeared absolutely changed 
she seemed to propose knowing no opinion or disappointment or peculiar concern in the discovery 
emma looked as her nine unable to speak 
had you any in a cried arrear of miss being ii 
m 17 emma 
in love with her i 
you perhaps might you blushing as she spoke 
who can see into everybody's heart 
but nobody else 
7 a upon my word a said emma a i begin to doubt to having any such talent 
can you seriously ask me married whether i imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that i why if not openly 
encouraging you to give way to your own feelings 
— i never had the slightest suspicion till within the last hour of mr frank churchill’s having the lean regard for jane fairest 
you may be very sure that if i had i should have mentioned you accordingly 
a me l 
cried harriet colouring and astonished 
why should you caution me 
— you do not think i care about mr frank church 
7 a i am delighted to hear you speak so not on the subject a replied emma smiling 
a but you do not mean to deny that there was a time 
and not very distant either 
when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him 
a him 
— 
never never 
dear miss woodhonse how could you so mistake me 
a turning away distressed 
a harriet a cried emma after a moment's pause what do you mean i 
good heaven 
what do you mean 2 
mistake on 
— am i to suppose then 2 she could not speak another word 
her voice was lost 
and she sat down waiting in great terror till harriet should answer 
harriet who was standing at some distance and with face turned from her did not immediately say anything 
and when she did speak it was in a voice early as agitated as emma 
a should not have thought it possible 2 she began that you could have misunderstood me 
i know we agreed never to name him 
but considering how infamy 
49 unite 
say for he in to everybody else i should not have holi’gclii it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person 
mr frank church indeed 
i do not know who would ever look at him in the company oftheother 
hope haveabettertaatethanto think of mr frank church who in like nobody by his side 
and that you should have been 30 mistaken is amazing 1 
1 am sure but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment i should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost to dare to think of him 
at rest if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened 
that there had been matches of greater dale party those were your very words 
i should not have dared to give way to 
just should not have thought it possible 
but if 13 who had been always acquainted with him a a harriet cried emma collecting herself resolutely v let us understand each other now without the possibility of farther mistake 
are you speaking of 
mr nightly 
7 a to be sure i am 
i never could have an idea of anybody else 
and so i thought you knew 
when we talked about him it was as clear as possible a not quite a a returned emma with forced calmness 
a for all that you then said appeared to me to relate to a different person 
i could most men 
that you had met 
mr frank church 
i am sure the service mr frank church had rendered you in protecting you from the 8 tea was spoken of -5 
oh no woodhome how on do forget 
a my dear harriet i perfectly remember the substance of what i said on the occasion 
i told you that i did not wonder at your attachment 
that considering the service he had rendered you it was extremely natural 
— and you agreed to it expressing yaurtelfnry 46 mass 
warmly as to your sense of that service and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue 
the impression of it is strong on my memory a oh dear a cried harriet a now i recollect what you mean 
but i was thinking of something very different at the one 
it was not the go less 
it was not mr frank church that i meant 
oh l 4 with some eleanor i was thinking of a much more precious circumstance 
of mr knightley’s coming and asking me to dance when mr ellison would not stand up with me and when there was no other partner in the room 
that was the kind action 
that was the noble benevolence and generosity 
that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon with good god 
a cried emma “thishasbeenamost unfortunate 
most deplorable mistake 
what is to be done i a you would not have encouraged me then if you had understood me 
at least however i can not be worse of than i should have been if the other had been the person 
and wit is possible 
-5 she paused a few moments 
emma could not 
i do not wonder miss woodhousc she resumed that you should feel a great difference between the two 
as to me or as to anybody 
you must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other 
but i hope miss warehouse that supposing 
that if 
strange as it may appear but you know they were your own words that more wonderful things had happened 
matches of greater disparity had taken place than between mr frank church and me 
and therefore it seems as if such a thing even as this may have occurred before 
and if i should be so fortunate begun 41 youand expression as to 
if mr nightly should really jhdmnmnﬁnddledianhy l hope dear miss woodhouae you will not met younelfagamn it and try to put difficulties in the way 
but you are loo good for that i am sure harriet was standing at one of the windows 
emma turned round to look at her in commission and hastily laid 
a have you any idea of mr knightley’o returning your affection 
7 a yet a replied harriet modestly but not fearfully 
i must say that i have 
emma eyes were instantly withdrawn 
and the sat silently meditating in a fixed attitude for a few minutes 
a few minutes were deficient for making her acquainted with her own heart 
a mind like here once opening to suspicion made rapid progress 
she touched she admitted the acknowledged the whole truth 
why was it so much worse that harriet should he in love with mr nightly than with frank church 
why was the evil i dreadfully increased by han-iet’s having some ho of a return 
it darted through her with the speed of an sorrow that mr nightly must marry no one but here 
herowuconducgaewellaa herownheargwarhefore her in the same few minutes 
she saw it all with a clearer which had never blind her before 
how improved by had she been acting by harriet 
how in 
cousin case how indelicate how irrational how unfeeling had been her conduct 
what blindness what madness had led her on it struck her with dreadful force and she was ready to invite every had name in the world 
some portion of respect for herself however in spite of all then demerits some concern for her own appearance and a strong sense of jane by harriet there would be no need of common 
to the 14 em 
girl who believed herself loved by mr nightly 
but justice retained that the should not he made unhappy by any so ducks now gave emma the resolution to it and endure farther with calmness with even apparent kindness 
for her own advantage indeed it was at that the utmost extent of harriet s hopes should he inquired into 
and harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained or to deserve to be slighted by the person whose counsel had never led her right 
rousing from dejection therefore and subduing her emotion she turned to harriet again and in a more inviting accent renewed the conversation 
for as to the subject which had first introduced it the wonderful story of one fair that was quite sunk and low neither of them thought but of mr slightly and themselves 
harriet who had been standing in no unhappy reverie was yet very glad to he called from it by the now encouraging manner of such a judge and such a friend an miss warehouse 
and only wanted invitation to give the history of her hopes with great though trembling delight 
emma tremblings as she asked and as the listener were better concealed than harriet but they were not less 
her voice war not unsteady but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self inch a hum of threatening evil such a confusion of sudden and perplexity emotions must create 
she listened with much towards fingering but with great outward patience to henrietta detail 
methodical or well arranged or very well delivered it could not he expected to be 
but it contained when separated from all the feebleness and apology of the nation a lubmnnce to sink her spirit 
especially with the corroborating circumstances which her own memory brought in favour of mr knightley’s most improved opinion of harriet 
sum 
49 harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances 
emma knew that he had on that occasion found her much superior to his expectation 
from that evening or at lent from the time of miss woodhouse’s encouraging he to think of him harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to so and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her 
— a manner of kindness and sweetness 
eagerly she had been more and more aware of it 
when they had been all walking together he had so often come and walked by her and talked so very deligxtﬁillyl 
he seemed to want to be acquainted with her 
emma knew it to have been very much the case she had often observed the change to almost the same extent 
harriet repeated expressions of approbation my praise from him 
and emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of harriet 
he praised her for being without art or affectation 
for having simple honest generous feelings 
she knew that he saw such recommendations in anxiety 
he had dwelt on them to her more than once 
much that lived in harriet s memory many little particulars of the notice she had received from him a look a speech a removal from one chair st another a compliment implied a preference inferred lid been unnoticed because ensue tied by emma 
circumstances that might swell to ha fan hour's relation and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them had passed undisturbed by her who now heard de 
but the two latest occurrences to he mentioned 
the two of strongest promise to harriet 
were not without some degree of witness from emma herself 
the rest was his walking with her apart from the others in the lime-walk at dwell w ere they had been walking some time before emma came and he 1810 emma 
hadtakenpainc ashevnueonvinced told her from the rest to himself 
and at first he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before 
in a very particular way indeed l 
harriet could not recall it without a blush 
he seemed to be almost asking her whether her affections were engaged 
but as noon on the miss womlhounc appeared likely to join them he changed the subject and began talking about forming 
the second wan his having at talking with her nearly half an hour before emma came back from her visit the very last morning of his being at hatfield 
— though when he am came in he had said that he could not nay five minutes 
and his having told her during their conversation that though he must 9 to london it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all which was much more as emma felt than he had acknowledged to sir 
the superior degree of condolence towards harriet which this one article marked gave her severe in 
on the object of the rest of the two circumstance she did after a little reflection venture the following question 
-5 might he nod 
is not it possible that when inquiring as you thought into the taste of you 
affections he might be alluding to mr marking 
nine might have mr marking interest in view 
a but ham rose the action with it 
m no indies 
l 
there wan not a hint of mr marking 
i hope i know better now than to can for mr marmion or to be suspected of it when harriet had closed her evidence the appeal to her dear miss woodhouee to naywhethershehal not good ground for hope 
a i never could have presumed to think of it at rest a little “butforyon 
you told me to observe him really and let his behaviour be the rule of mine 
up no i have 
but now i seem tofeelthatimzu arms 18 deserve him 
and that if he does chose me it will not be anything so very wonderful the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech the many bitter feelings made the utmost exertion necessary on emma side to enable her to say on by 
— “hnn'iet i will only venture to claim that mr nightly is the last man in the world who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory 
and emma was only saved from rapture and fondness which at that moment would have been dreadful penance by the sound of her father's footsteps 
he was coming through the hall 
harriet was too much agitated to encounter him 
a she could not compose herself 
mr warehouse would be alarmed 
she had better go 
a 
with most ready encouragement from her friend 
therefore she passed off through another door 
and the moment she was gone this was the stations burst of emma feelings 
-5 oh god i that had never seen her 
6 the rest of the day the following night were hardly enough for her thoughts 
she was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours 
every moment had brought a fresh surprise 
and every surprise must be matter of humiliation to her 
how to understand it all 
how to understand the deception she had been thus practising on herself and living under 
the blunders the blindness of her own head and heart 
she sat still she walked about she tried her own room she tried the shrubbery 
in every place every posture she perceived that she had acted most weekly 
that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree 
that she had been imposing on herself in a degree more mortifying 
that she was wretched and shall probably and this day but the beginning of wretchedness 
18 emma 
to understand thoroughly understand her own heart was the list endeavour 
to that point went every leisure moment which her father's claims on her allowed and every moment of involuntary absence of mind 
how long had mr nightly been so dear to her as every feeling declared him now to be 
when had his influence such insolence begun 
when had he proceeded to that place in her affection which frank church had once for a short period occupied 
— she looked back 
she compared the two 
compared them as they had always s stood in her estimation from the time of the latter coming known to her 
and as they must at any time have been compared by her had it 
oh 
had it by any blessed felicity occurred to her to insinuate the comparison 
she saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider mr slightly as infinitely the superior or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear 
she saw that in persuading herself in fancying in acting to the contrary she had been entirely under a delusion totally ignorant of her own heart 
and in short that the had never ally cared for frank church at all 
this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection 
thin was the knowledge of herself on the list union of inquiry which she reached 
and without being long in reaching it 
she was most sorrowfully indignant 
ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her 
her affection for mr nightly 
every other part of her mind was disgusting 
with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of everybody's feelings 
with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body destiny 
she wan proved to have been universal s mistaken 
and she had not quite done nothing 
for the had done mischief 
she had brought evil on harriet on herself emma 
18 and she too much feared on mr nightly 
were this most on us of all connections to take place on her must rest the reproach of having given it a beginning 
for his attachment she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of harriet 
— and even were this not the case he would never have known harriet at all but for her folly 
mr slightly and harriet smith l 
it was an union to distance every wonder of the kind 
the attachment of frank church and jane fairest become commonplace threadbare stable in the comic risen exciting no surprise presenting no disparity a ring nothing to be said or thought 
mr night and harriet smith 
such an elevation on her side 
such a debasement on his 
it was horrible to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion to foresee the miles the seems the merriment it would prompt t at his next pens 
the mortification and disdain of his brother the sound inconvenience to himself 
could it be 
no 
it was in his 
and et it was far far from impouihlellofwas it a new circumstance me of first-rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers 
was it new for one perhaps too busy to seek to be the prize of a girl who would seek him 
was it new for anything in this world to be unequal inconsistent incongruous 
or for chance and circumstance as second causes to direct the human fate 
oh 
had she never brought harriet forward 
had she left her where she ought and where he had told her she ought 
had she not with a folly which no tongue could express prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to before all would have been safe 
none of this dreadful sequel would have been 
how harriet could ever have had the presumption 1814 emma 
to raise her thoughts to mr nightly 
— 
how she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man all actually assured of it 3 but harriet was less humble had fewer scruples than formerly 
her inferiority whether of mind or situation seemed little felt she had seemed more sensible of mr eton being to stoop marrying her than the now seemed of mr knightlcy’s 
all was not that her own doing too 
who had been at pains to give harriet notions of self-consequence but herself 2 who but herself had taught her that she was to elevate herself if possible and that her claims were great to a high wore my establishment 
if harriet from being humble were grown vain it was her doing too 
cost 19 
ill now that she was threatened with its loss emma had never known how much of her ha insist depended on being in 
with mr knightleyfllirst in interest and affection 
satisfied that it was so and feeling it her due the had enjoyed it without detection 
and only in the dread of being supplanted found how sex possibly important it had been 
long ve long the all the had been first 
for having no female connections of his own there had been only isabella whose claim could be come red with hers and she had always known exactly how at he loved and esteemed isabella 
she had herself been first with him for many years past 
she had not deserved it 
the had often been negligent or perverse slighting his advice or even wilfully opposing him insensible of half his merits and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge e her false and insolent estimate of her own 
but still from family attachment and habit and thorough runs 
1810 excellence of mind he had loved her and watched over her from a girl with an endeavour to improve her and an anxiety for her doing right which no other creature had at all shared 
in spite of all her faults she knew she was dear to him 
might the not say very dear 
when the suggestions of ho however which must follow here presented themselves she could not presume indulge them 
harriet smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly exclusively stately loved by mr nightly 
so could not 
he could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to be 
she had received a very recent proof of its impartiality 
how shocked had he been yet her behaviour to miss hates 
how directly how strong had he expressed himself to her on the subject 
flat too sang for the offence 
but far far too strongly to issue from any feeling offer than upright justice and clear-sighted good-will 
she had no hope nothing to deserve them of ho that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question 
but there was a hope at times a slight one at times much stronger that harriet might have received herself and he overacting his regard for bet 
wish it she must for his sake 
be the consequence nothing to herself but his remaining single all his life 
could she be secure of that indeed of his never marrying at all she believed she should be perfectly satisfied 
let him but continue the same mr nightly to her and her father the me mr nightly to all the world 
let well and hatfield lose none their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence and her pace would be fully secured 
marriage in fact would not do for her 
it would be incompatible with what she owed to her father and with what she felt for him 
nothing should separate her from her father 
she would not marry even if she were asked by mr nightly 
6 out 
it must be her ardent with that harriet might be disappointed 
and she hoped that when able to see them together again she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were 
she could see them henceforward with the closest observance 
and wretchedly a. the had hitherto mitundemood even those the wm watching she did not know how to admit that the could be blinded here 
he was expected seek every day the power of observation would be noon given 
artfully soon it appeared when her thought 
were in one corner 
in the meanwhile she resolved against seeing harriet 
it would do neither of them good it would do the subject no good to be talking of it farther 
she was resolved not to be convinced as long as she could doubt and yet had no authority for supposing harriet confidence 
to talk would be only to imitate 
she wrote to her therefore kindly but de 
decisively to beg that she would not at present come to hatfield 
acknowledging it to be her conviction that all farther confidential discussion of on topic had better be avoided 
and hoping that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again except in the company of others 
she objected only to a mae-mbthey might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday 
harriet submitted and approved and was grateful 
thin point wan just arranged when a visitor arrived tart emma thought a little from the one subject which had engaged them sleeping or waking the last twenty-four hours 
mr westons who had been calling on her daughter-in-law elect and took hotels in her way home almost at much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview 
mr action had accompanied her to mr banks and gone through his share of this essential attention emma 
47 most handsomely 
but she having then induced miss fair to join her in an airing was now returned with much more to say and much more to say with satisfaction than a quarter of an hour spent in mrs yates's parlour with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings could have afforded 
a little curiosity emma had and she made the most of it while her friend related 
mrs westons hardest off to pay the visit in a deal of agitation herself 
and in the first place ha wished not to go at all at present to be allowed merely to write to miss fairest matter and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed 
and mr church could be reconciled to the engagement becoming known 
as considering everything 
she thought such a visit could not he without leading to reports 
but mr westons had thought differently 
he was extremely anxious to show his approbation to miss fair and her family and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it 
or if it were that it would be of any consequence 
he 
such things 
he observed always got about 
emma smiled and felt that mr westons had very good reason for saying so 
they had gone in short 
and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady 
she had hardly been able to speak a word and every look and action had shown how deeply she was suffering from consciousness 
the quiet heartfelt satisfaction of the old lady and the rapturous delight of her daughter who proved even joyous to talk usual had been a gratifying yet almost an affecting scene 
they were both so truly respectable in their happiness so interested in every sensation 
thought so much of june 
on much of everybody and no little of themselves that every kindly feeling was at work for them 
miss fairfax’l recent illness had offered a fair less for mrs lesson to invite her to an airing 
she drawn back and declined at first but on being pressed had 38 man 
yielded 
and in the course of their drive my westons had by gentle encouragement overcome in much of her embamurnent as to bring her to convey on the important aspect 
apologies for her seemingly audacious silence in their first reception and the warmest expressions of the gratitude the wan always feeling toward herself and mr westons must nccewuﬂy open the cabinet 
but when these effusion were put by they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement 
mrs westons wan convinced that such conversation must he the greatest relief to her companion went up within her own mind an everything had no long been and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject 
5 on the of what the had suffered during the concealment of so many months continued mrs woodston she was energetic 
this was one of her next 
pressing a i will not say that no i entered into the engagement i have not had come happy moment 
but i can lay that i have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour a 
-and the quivering lip emma which uttered it was an animation that i felt at my heart a poor l 1 said emma a she thinks herself wrong then for having consented to a private engage meant 1 
wrong 
no one i believe can blame her more than she in dictated to blame herself 
the consequence a it the has been a state of trial suffering to me 
and no it ought 
but after altered punishment that misconduct can bring it it still not let misconduct 
pain is no explanation 
i never can be blameless 
i have been acting contrary to all my sense of right 
and the fortunate turn that everything has taken and the kindness i am now receiving in what my conscience tells ought not to be do not imagine madam 6 the conduct that i wan taught wrong 
do not let any rejection emma 
49 fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up 
the error has been all my own 
and i do assure you that with all the excuselthat resent circumstance to 
ve i shall dread making the mwnfnivalgpgrcdoglel campbell 
poor girl 
a laid emma again 
a she loves him then excessively i suppose 
it must have been from attachment only that she could he led to form the engagement 
her affection must have overpowered her judgment 
a year i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him i am afraid a returned emma wishing that i must often have contributed to make her unhappy 5 on your ride my love it was very innocently done 
but she probably had something of that in her thoughts when alluding to the misunderstanding which he had given no hint of before 
one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in she said was that of making her amenable 
the conacioumeu of having done mine had exposed her to a thousand inquietude and made her caution 
and irritable to a degree that must have been 
that had been 
hard for him to hear 
a i did not make the allowances 1 said the a which i ought to have done for his temper and spirits his delightful smirks and that gaiety that playfulness of disposition which under any other circumstances would i am sure have been as constantly watching to me as they were at little she then began to speak of you and of the great kindness you had shown her during her illness 
and with a blush which showed me how it was all connected desired me whenever i had an opportunity to thank you 
i could not thank you too much 
for every with and every endeavour to do her good 
she was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself ii 
a 30 inn 
a if i did not know her to be happy now a said emma seriously a which in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience she must be i could not hear these thanks 
for oh 
mrs westons if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good i have done in fairest well 1 checking himself and trying to be more lively this is all to he forgotten 
you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars 
they show her to the greater advantage 
i am sure she is very good 
i hope she will he very happy 
it is it that the fortune should he on his tide for i think the merit will be all on hers 
such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs westons 
she thought well of frank in almost every respect 
and what was more she loved him very much and her defence was therefore earnest 
she talked with a great deal of man must at least equal affection 
but she had too much to urge for emma attention 
it was noon gone to benwick square or to dwell 
she forgot to attempt to linen 
and when mrs westons ended with we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for you know but i hope it will noon came she was obliged to pause before she answered and at last obliged to answer at modern before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for 
are you well my emma

i am always well you know 
be ruletnglve me intelligenoeofthelenerusoonu possible mrs wars communications furnished emma with more food for unpleasant reflections by increasing her esteem and compassion and her sense of past injustice towards miss f airs 
she bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her and blushed for me 
11 the anxious feelings which had certainly been in some measure the cause 
had she followed 1 nights i known wishes in paying that attention to miss f airs at which was every w her due 
and she tried to know her better 
lad she he her towardsintimacy 
had she endeavoured to and a friend there instead of in harriet smith 
she must in all probability have been from every pain which pressed on her now 
birth ties and education had been equally marking one as an associate for her to be received with gratitude 
and the other 
what was she 
supposing even that they had never become intimate friends 
that she had never been admitted into miss fairfax’s confidence on this important matter 
which was most probable 
still in knowing her as she ought and as she might 
she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to mr diction which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself but had so reasonably imparted 
an idea which she greatly fox 
a had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of jane feelings the levity or carelessness of frank church s 
oh 1 the sources of evil nil-rounding the former since her coming to highly she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worn 
she must have been a return enemy 
t never could have been all line together having stayed jane fairfax’s peace in a thousand instances 
and on box hill pass it had been the agony of mind twould m no more 
the evening of this day was very long and melancholy at hand 
the weather melted what it could of gloom 
a cold stormy rain set in and nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs which the wind was describing and the length of the day which only made such cruel sights the longer visible 
15 emma 
the weather affected mr woodhoune 
and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter side and by exertion which had never coat her half to much before 
it reminded her of their first forlorn the 
‘a-tete on the evening of mr westons wedding-day 
but mr nightly had walked in then soon after tea and dissipated every melancholy fancy 
alas 
such delightful proofs of hartﬁeld’a attraction an those sort of visiting conveyed might shortly be over 
the picture which she had then drawn of the private of the approaching winter had proved erroneous 
no friends had deserted them no creature had been lost 
but her present forebodings the feared would experience no similar contradiction 
the prospect before her now wan threatening to a degree that could not be entirely diqrclled— that might not be even partially brightened 
if all took place that might take acre among the circle of her friends hatfield must comparatively deserted 
and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness 
the child to be born at random must be a tie there even dearer than half 
and mr westons heart and time would be occupied by it 
they should lose her 
and probably in great more her husband also 
frank church would return among them no more 
and miss fair it was reasonable to suppose would noon cease to belong to highly 
they would be married and settled either at or near combe 
all that were good would be withdrawn 
and if to these lose the loss of dwell were to be added what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their much

what could be increasing emma wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind that it had been all her own work 
when it came to such a pitch at this the was not able to refrain from a part or a heavy sigh or me from walking about the room for a few seconds 
and the only source whence anything like consolation or composure could be drawn wan in the resolution of her own better conduct and the hope that however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the part it would yet and her more rational more acquainted with herself and leave her sense to regret when it were gone

he rather continued much the name all the following morning 
and the same loveliness and the game melancholy seemed to resign at hatfield 
but in the afternoon it dared 
the wind changed into a softener quarter 
the clouds were carried of the sun simpered 
it was manner again 
with all the eager which inch a transition giver emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as able 
never had the exquisite sight smell confusion of nature tranquil warm and brilliant after a storm been more attractive to her 
she longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce 
and on mr parrys coming in soon after dinner with a disengaged hour to give her father she 14 em

and the first 
probable cause for it agreed byherfmmdnathehadperhapuheencommunicating his blast his brother and was pained by the manner in which had been received 
they walked together 
e was silent 
she thought he was often looking at her and trying for a full view of her face than it suited her to give 
and belief produced another dread 
perhaps he wanted to peak to her of till attachment to harriet he might watching for encouragement to begin

cried emma turning her glowing cheeks towards him 
for while she spoke it occurred to her that he might have called at mrs edward s in his way 
i had a few lines on parish business from mr westons this morning and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened 
emma was quite relieved and could presently say with a little more composure 
a you probably have been less surprised than any of us for you have had your suspicions 
i have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution 
i wish had attended to it 
last with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh 8 i seem to have been doomed to blindness 
for a moment owe nothing was said and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest till she found her arm drawn within his and pressed against his heart and heard him thus saying in a tone of great sensibility speaking low 
a time my dearest emma time will heal the wound

her arm was dressed again as he added in a more broken and cut used accent the feelings of the warmest friendship

i have never attached to him

he never wished to attach me 
it was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another 
it was hit object to blind all about him 
and no one i am sure could be more effectually blinded than myself 
except that i was no blinded 
that it was my good fortune 
that in short i war somehow or other safe from him

20 
abashed yet without losing a word 
to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole 
to see that harriet hopes had been entirely groundless a mistake a delusion as complete a delusion as any of her own 
that harriet was nothing 
that she was everything herself 
that what she had been saying relative to harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings 
and that her agitation her doubts her reluctance her discouragement had been all received as discouragement from herself 
and not only was there time for these convictions with all their glow of attendant happiness there was time also to rejoice that harriet secret had not escaped her and to resolve that it need not and should not 
it was all the service she could now render her poor friend 
for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to harriet as infinitely the most worthy of the two 
— or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever without touching any motive because he could not marry them both emma had it not 
she felt for harriet with pain and with contrition 
but no right of generosity run mad opposing all that could be probable or reasonable entered her brain 
she had led her friend astray and it would be a reproach to her for ever 
but her judgment was as strong as her feelings and as strong as it had ever been before in reprobation any such alliance for him as most unequal and degrading 
her way was clear though not quite smooth 
she felt then on being so entreated 
what did she say 
us what she ought of course 
a lady always does 
she said enough to show there need not be despair 
and to invite him to say more himself 
he bad despaired at one period

on his side there had been a long-standing jealousy old as the arrival or even the expectation of frank church 
he had been in love with emma and jealous of frank church from about the same period one sentiment having probably enlightened him ii to the other 
it was his jealousy of frank church that had taken him from the country 
the box hill party had decided him on going away 
he would save himself from witnessing again such permitted encouraged attentions 
he had gone to am to be indifferent 
but he had gone to a wrong place 
there wan too much domestic happiness in hill other's house

he had found her agitated and low 
frank church was a villain 
he heard her declare that he had never loved him

they sat down to tea

airs long a mr nightly remained with than emma fever continued 
but when he were gone she began to be a little tranquillized and subdued and in the come of the ii self night which war the tax for inch an evening the and one or two such very serious point coincide 
a made her feel whatever her happiness 
-5 news must have some alloy 
her father 
and harriet 
she could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims 
and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost was the question 
with respect to her father it was a question soon answered 
she hardly knew yet what mr nightly would ask 
but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father 
she even wept over the idea of it as a sin of thought 
while he lived it must be only an engagement 
but she flattered herself that if diverted of the danger of drawing her away it might become an increase of comfort to him 
how to do her best by harriet was of more difficult decision 
how to spare her from any unnecessary pain 
how to make her any possible atonement 
how to a rap least her enemy 
on these suspect her perhaps anxiety and distress were very great 
an her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it 
she could only resolve at last that she would will avoid a meeting with her 
and communicate all that need be told by letter 
that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from highly and 
indulging in one scheme more 
nearly resolve that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to benwick s are 
isabella had been pleased with harriet 
and a w weeks spent in london must give her some amusement 
she did not think it in harriet nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety by the streets the shops and the children 
at any rate it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself from whom everything was due 
a separation for the present 
an averting of the evil day when they must all be together again

by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of anybody clue 
when a letter was brought her from anhalt a very thick letter 
the guess what it must contain and deprecated the necessity of reading it

— a note in my ennui to herself ushered in the letter from frank to mrs westons 
i have the greatest me my dear emma in forwarding to you the case do i know what thorough notice you will do it and have scarcely a doubt of it happy effect 
i think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again 
but i will not delay you by a long prefaced 
we are quite well 
this letter he been the cure fill the little nervousness i have been feeling lately 
i did not quite like your looks on tuesday but it was an genial morning 
and though you will never own being affected by weather i think everybody feel a north-east wind 
i felt for your dear father very much in the form of tuesday afternoon end yesterday morning 
but had the comfort of hearing last night my mr party that it had not made him 
— you ever was

if i made myself intelligible yesterday this letter will be expected 
but expected or not i know it will he read with ardour and indulgence 
you mall goodness and i believe there will he need ofevenallyourgoodneeawallowlbrlomepamol'my m conduct 
but i havevheen forgiven by one who will more to resent 
my courage rises while i write 
it in very difficult for the pmepemua to be humble 
i have already met with such success in two application for pardon that i may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours and of those among our friends who have had any ground of offence 
on must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when i lit arrived at rascally 
you must coniidermeachzvinganecmwhich was to bekeptatall hazards 
this was the fact 
my right to class myself in a situation requiring such compliment ll another question 
i shall not disgust here 
for my temptation to lit 
it a right i refer every called to tricks house lashed window below and casement above in higher 
i dared not address her openly 
my difﬁcullice in the then race of income must be too well known to urge definition 
and i was fortunate enough to prevail 
be more we parted at weymouth and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to beg in charity to a secret engagement had she refused should have gone mad 
but you will be ready to say what was your hope in doing this 
what did you look forward to 
to anything everything 
to time chance circumstance slow effects sudden burst perseverance and wearied health and sickness 
every possibility of good was before me and the first ofblcasinge secured in obtaining her promise of faith and correct runs 
despondence 
if you need farther explanation i have the honour my dear madam of being your husband son and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good which no inheritance of houses or lands am ever equal the value of 
see me then under these circumstances arriving on my em 
visit to rascally 
and here i an conscious of wrong for that visit might havcbeen sooner paid you will look back and see that i did not come till miss fairest was in higher 
and as you were the person slighted you will forgive me instantly 
but i must work on my father's compassion by reminding him that so long as i absented myself from his house so long i lost the blessing of knowing you 
my behaviour during the very happy fortnight which i spent with you did not i hope lay me open to apprehension excepting on one point 
and now i come to the principal the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you which excites my own anxiety or requires very solicitous explanation 
with the greatest rest t and the warmest friendship do i men 
soon miss house 
my father perhaps will think i ought to add with the deepest humiliation 
a few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion and some censure i acknowledge myself liable to 
my behaviour to miss warehouse indicated i believe more than it ought 
in order to assist a concealment so essential to me i was led on to make more than an allowable of the son of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown 
i can not deny that miss warehouse was my sensible object 
but i in run you will believe the declaration that had i not been convinced of her indifference i would not have been induced by any selfish view to go on 
amiable and delightful an miss woodhouae is she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached 
and that she was perfectly weep from any tendency to being attached to me was as much sum 
20 my conviction as my wish 
she received my attentions with an easy friendly good-humour playfulness which exactly suited me 
we seemed to understand each other 
from our relative simpson those attentions were her due and were felt to be so 
whether miss warehouse began really to understand me before the expectation of that fortnight i can not say 
when i called to take leave of her i remember that i was within a moment of confessing the truth and i then fancied she was not without suspicion 
but i have no doubt of her having since detected me 
at least in some degree 
she may not have surmised the whole but her quickness must have penetrated a part 
i can not doubt it 
you will and whenever the subject becomes free from its present restraints that it did not take her wholly by surprise 
she frequently gave me hints of it 
i remember her telling me at the ball that i owed mrs eton gratitude for her attentions to miss fairest 
i hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss 
while you considered the as having sinned against emma warehouse i could deserve nothing from either 
acquit me here and procure for me when it is allowable the actual and good wishes of that said emma warehouse whom i regard with so much brotherly affection as to long to have beast deeply and as happily in love as myself 
whatever strange things i said or did during that fortnight you have now a key to 
my heart was in higher and my business was to get my body thither often as might be and with the least suspicion 
if you remember any queernesses set them all to the right account 
of the pianoforte so much talked of i feel it only necessary to say that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to miss f 
who would never have allowed me to send it had any choice been given her 
the delicacy of her mind throughout the 24th whole engagement 
my dear madam in much beyond my power of doing justice to 
you will noon i earnestly hope know her thoroughly yourself 
no description an describe her 
she must tell you half what iii in 
yet not word for never war there a human creature who would no designedly suppress her own merit 
since i began thin letter which will be longer than i foresaw i have heard from her 
she gives a good account of her own health 
but an they never complaint i dare not depend 
i want to have your opinion of her look 
i know you will noon call on her 
she in living in dread of the visit 
perhaps it it paid already 
let me hear from you without delay 
i am impatient for a thousand particular 
remember how few minutes i was at candle and in how bewildered how mad a made and i am not much better yet 
still inand either from happineuormiaery 
when i think of he kindness and over i have met with of her excellence and patience and my uncle generosity i am mad with joy but when i recollect all the uneasiness occasioned her and how little i deserve to be forgiven i am mad with anger 
if i could but see her again 
but i must not propose it yet 
my uncle ha 
been too good for me to encroach 
i must still add to this long law 
you have not heard all that you ought to hear 
i could not give any connected detail yesterday 
but the ruddenneand in one light the nmeanonahleness with which the fair burn out need 
explanation 
for though the event of the 24th us an you will conclude immediately opened to me the happiest prospects 
i should not have pressed on such early features but from the veryparticular circuit dance which left me not an hour to lose 
i should myself have shrunk from anything no beauty and die would have felt every icﬂlplc of mine with multiply lived strength and retirement but i had no choice

hasty engagement the had entered into with that woman 
— here my dear madam i was obliged to leave of abruptly to recollect and compose myself 
i have been walking over the country and am now i hope rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be 
it is in fact a most mortifying retrospect for me 
i behaved shamefully 
and here i can admit that my manners must w. in being unpleasant to miss f. were highly blamable 
so distant proved them which ought to have been enough 
i 
plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient 
she was disposed i thought unreasonably so 
i thought her on a thousand occasions recede scrupulous and cautious 
i thought her even end 
but the was always right 
if i had followed her judgment and subdued my rise to the level of what she deemed proper i how d have escaped the greatest unhappiness have ever known 
we quarrelled 
do you remember the morning spent at dwell 
there every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a cross 
i was late i met her walking home by herself and wanted to walk with her but she would not suffer it 
she absolutely refused to allow me which i then thought mr unreasonable 
now however i see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion 
while i to blind the world to our engagement was behaving one hour with objectionable parties 
party to another woman was she to be comer-rung the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless 
had we been met walking together between well and highly the truth must have been led was mad enough however to resent 
i suited her affection 
i doubted it more the next day on box hill 
when provoked by such conduct on my ride such shameful into eat neglect of her and such apparent devotion to miss w. as it 22 bias 
would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure she knew her resentment in a inn of words perfectly into liable to me 
in short my dear madam it was a quarrel blame on her side abominable on mine 
and i returned the tarneeveoing to richmond though i might have said with you till the next morning merely because i would be as angry with her as possible 
even then i was not such i fool as not to mean tobereconciled in time 
but i was the injured person 
injured by her coldness 
and i went away determined that she should make the true advances 
i shall always i congratulate myself that you were not of the box hill party 
had you witnessed my behaviour there i can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again 
its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced 
as soon as she found i was really gone from rascally the closed with the offer of that olhciout mr eton 
the whole system of whose treatment of her by the bye has ever ailed me with indignation and hatred 
i must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which ha been so richly extended towards myself 
but otherwise i should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known 
jane a indeed 
you will observe that l have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name even to you 
think then what i must have endured in hearing it fancied between the westons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition and all the insolence of imaginary superiority 
have patience with me i shall soon have done 
she closed with this offer resolving to break with me entirely and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again

this letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt death 
i answered it within an hour 
but from the confusion of man 
23 my mind and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once my answer instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day was locked up in my writing-desk and i trusting that i had written enough though but a few lines to satisfy her remained without any uneasiness 
i was rather die pointed that i did not hear from bargain speedily 
it i made excuses for her and was too busy and 
may i add 
— wo cheerful in my views to be cautious 
we removed to wisdom 
and two days afterwards i received a parcel from her 
my own letters all returned 
and a few lines at the same time by the post stating her extreme rise at not having had the smallest reply to her last 
an adding that as silence on such 3 it could not be misconstmed.andasit mustheeq ydelirabletoboth to have every subordinate an'angernent concluded as soon as possible she now sent me by a safe conveyance all my letters and requested that if i could not directly command hers so as to send them to highly within a week i wouldforward them after that period to her a

i knew the name the place i knew all about it and instantly saw what she had been doing 
it was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which i knew her to possess 
and secrecy she had maintained stop any such design in her former letter was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy

his letter must make its way to emma’feelings 
she was obliged in spite of her previous determination to the contrary to do it all the notice that mrs westons foretold 
as soon as she came to her ears 
15 own name it was irresistible 
every line relating to herself was interesting 
and almost every line agreeable 
and when this charm ceased the subject could still maintain itself by the natural return of her former regard for the writer and the very strong attraction which any picture of love most have for her at that moment 
she never stopt till she had gone through the whole and though i impossible not to feel that he had been wrong yet he had been less wrong than she had up and he had suffered and wasverysorry 
and e was so grateful to mrs easton and so much in love with miss fair and she was so happy herself that there was no being severe 5 and could he have entered the room she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever 
she thought so well of the letter that when mr nightly came a in she desired him to read it 
she was sure of mrs man's wishing it to he communicated 
especially to one who like mr nightly had seen so much to blame in his conduct 
a i shall he very glad to look over a said he 
but it seems long 
i will take it home with me at night 
but that would not do 
mr westons was to call in the evening and she must return it by him 
a i would rather be talking to you 4 he replied 
but as it seems a matter of justice it shall he done he began 
stopping however almost directly to say a had i been offered the sight of one of this gentleman's letter to his mother-in-law few months ago emma it would not have been taken with such in essence 
he proceeded a little farther reading to himself 
and then with a smile observed humph 
a one complimentary opening but it is his way 
one means style must not he the rule of another 
e will not be severe a it will be natural for me 4 he added shortly afterwards a to speak my opinion aloud at i read 
by 16 runs 
doiugiglnhzllfeelthatl am near you 
will not be so seats lyme oftener 
but you dislike it 
— a at at all 
i should wish it 
mr nightly returned to his reading with greater alacrity 
life rides here said he was to the temptation 
he knows he is wrong and has nothing rational to urge 
bad 
he ought not to have formed the engagement 
a 
his father disposition a 
he is unjust however to his father 
mr westons sanguine temper was a blessing on all fall upright and honourable exertions 
but mr westons earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it 
very true 
he did not come till mist fairest was here a and i have not forgotten a said emma a how sure calm were that he might have come sooner if he would 
on pass it over very handsomely 
but you were perfectly right 
i was not quite impartial in my judgment emma 
but yet i think had you not been in the use i should still have distrusted him when he came to miss warehouse he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud 
all that related in her 
— with a smile a look a shake of the head a word or two of hauteur or disapprobation or merely of love at the subject required 
concluding however seriously and after steady rejection thus 
a very bad 
though it might have been worse 
playing a most dangerous game 
too much indebted to the event for his acquittal 
no judge of his own manner by you 
always deceived in fact by his own wishes and regardless of little besides his own convenience 
fancying you to have father his secret 
natural enough 
his own mind full of intrigue that he should suspect it in others 
mystery 
finesse 
how they prevent the understanding 
my emma does not run 
47 everything serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other i 
emma agreed to it and with a blush of sensibility on harriet account which she could not give any sincere explanation of 
a you had better go on a said she 
he did so but very soon stopt again to say a the pianoforte 
ah 
— that was the act of a very very young man one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure 
a boyish scheme indeed 
i can not comprehend a man s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with and he did know that the would have prevented the instrument coming if she could after this he made some progress without any pause 
frank churchill’s confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in 19 a 
a i perfectly agree with you sir a was then his remark 
a you did behave very shamefully 
you never wrote a truer line 
and having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement and his persisting to act in direct son to jane fairest s sense of right he made 2 her pause to say this is very bad 
he had induced her to place herself for his sake in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily 
she must have had much more to contend with in carrying on the correspondence than he could 
he should have respected even unreasonable scruple had there been such 
but hers were all reasonable 
we must look to her one fault and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement so hear that she should have been in such a state of punishment 
as in

7 a she had engaged to go as governess to mr smallridge’o children 
a dear friend of my elinor 
a neighbour of male grove 
and by the bye i wonder how mrs eton began the dinppoimmmt 
7 a say nothing my dear emma while you oblige me to read 
not even of mr eton 
only one page more 
i shall soon have done 
what a letter the man whims 
a i with men would read it with a kinder spirit towards him a well there feeling here 
he does seem to have suffered in sending her ill 
certainly i can have no doubt of his being fond of her 
a dearer much dearer than ever i hope he my long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation 
he in a very liberal man 
49 thanked with his thousands and tens of thousands 
— happier than i deserve come he knows herself there 
miss woodhon-e calls me the child of good fortune those were miss woodhooae’s words were they 
and a fine ending 
and there is the letter 
the child of good fortune 
a that 
was your name for him was it 
a you do not appear no well satisfied with letter in i am 
but still you must at lean i hope you must think the better ofhimfor it 
i hopeitdoeehirn lame service with you a yes certainly it does he has had great faults 
faults of consideration and tlmghdmess 
and i am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be ha entrance deserves but still as he is beyond a do really attached to miss fair and will noon it may be he have the advantage of being instants with her am very ready to believe his character i improve and acquire from hen the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants 
and now let me talk to you of something else 
i have another person's interest at present so much at heart that i can not think any longer about f rank church 
ever since i left on thin morning emma my mind ha been hard it work on one subject a the subject followed 
it visit in plain 
unaffected gentlemanlike english inch as mr nightly eleven horsewoman hawkins love with to be able to ask hero ma him without attacking the happiness of her father 
inmates answer was ready at the first word 
a while her dear father lived any change of condition must be impossible for her 
she could never quit him 
part only of this answer however was admitted 
the impossibility of her quitting her father mr slightly felt an me as herself 
but the inadmiuibility of any other change he ended not agree to 
20 she 
he had been thinking it over most ye m intently hehadatﬁnt induce rwoodhqueto remove with her to unwell 
he had wanted to believe it feasible but his knowledge of mr woodhouae would noisier him to deceive herself long 
and now he confessed hit per-iranian that much a mmplanmion would he a risk of her artless comfort i even of his life which must not be handed 
m oath taken from hatfield l 
no he felt that it ought not to beattempwd 
buttheplan which had arisen on the notice of thin he trusted his dearest emma would not and in any respect objectionable 
it was that he should he received at hatfield 
that is long in her father's happiness 
in other words his hatfield to continue her home it should he hid 
likewise 
of their all removing an well 
emma had already had her own passing thoughts 
like him the had tried the scheme'and rejected it 
but inch an alternative as thin had not occurred to her 
she won sensible of all the affection it since 
she felt that in quitting well he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence yours and habit 
that in living constantly with her father and in no home of how there would be much very much to be home with 
she promised to think of it and advise him to think of it more 
but he was fully convinced that no detection could alter his wife or his opinion on the object 
he had given it he could assure her very long and calm consideration 
he had been walking nwayfrorn william asking the whole morning to have half thought to himself 
a ah 
there it one difficulty unprovided for a cried emma 
a i am sure william asking will not like it 
you must get his consent before you ask misery she promised however to think of it 
and pretty 26 
21 nearly promised moreover to think of it with the intention of sending it a very good scheme 
it is remarkable that emma in the many very many points of view in which she was now beginning to consider dwell abbey was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry whose rights as heir-expectant had formerly been sounaciouely regarded 
think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy 
and yet the only gave herself a much conscious smile about it and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of mr knightley’s marrying jane fair or anybody else which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the winter and the aunt 
this up of his this plan of marrying and continuing at lady 
the more she contemplated it the more pleasing it became 
he evils seemed to lessen her own adieu to increase their mutual good to outweigh every ezwhnck 
such a companion for herself in the pride of anxiety and cheerlessness before her 
such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy 
she would have been too happy but for poor harriet 
but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend who must now be even excluded from hatfield 
the delightful family duty which emma was securing for herself poor garret must 
in mere charitable caution be kept at a distance from 
she would be a lower in every way 
emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment 
in such a party harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise 
but for the poor girl herself it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment 
in time of care mr nightly would forgotten i 
put 22 ma 
this supplanted 
this could not be expected to very early 
mr nightly himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure 
not like mr eton 
mr nightly also 
so kind so feeling so truly considerate for every s would never deserve to be less worships than now 
and it really was too much to hope even of harriet that she could be in love with more than the men in one part chasms 1 
twasaverygreat relief emma to and harriet as desirous as herself to avoid meeting 
their intercourse was mindful enough by letter 
how much worse had she a obliged to meet 
anxiety expel herself very much as might be supposed without reproaches or apparent use of ill-usage 
and yet emma fancied therewasasmnethingof resentment a something bordering on it in her style which increased the desirableness of their being separate 
it might be only her own comcionmeao 
but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke 
she had no difficulty in procuring isabella's invitation 
and the was fortunate in having a deficient reason for asking it without reporting to invention 
there was a tooth amiss 
harriet really wished and had wished some time to only a denial 
mrs john knife was delighted to he of use 
anything of ill health win a recommendation to her 
and though not so fond of a denial as of a mr singled she was quite eager to have harriet under her care 
when it was thus settled on her sisters side emma proposed it to her friend and found her very remarkable 
harriet was to go 
in 
23 she was invited for at least a fortnight 
she was to be conveyed in mr woodhouse’s marriage 
it was all arranged it was all completed and harriet was safe in benwick square 
now emma could indeed enjoy mr knightley’s visits 
now she could talk and she could listen with true happiness unchecked by that sense of injustice of guilt of something most pain which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her how much might at that moment and at a little distance be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself 
he difference of harriet at mrs edward s or in london made perhaps an unreasonable difference in emma sensations 
but she could not think of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment which must be evening the past and carrying her out of herself 
she would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which harriet had occupied 
there was a communication before her one which the only could be come at to make 
the confession of her engagement to her father 
but she would have nothing to do with it at present she had resolved to defer the disclosure till mrs westons were safe and well 
no additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved 
and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time 
a fortnight at last of leisure and peace of mind to crown every warmer but more agitating delight should be hers 
she soon resolved equally as a duty and a pleasure to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on miss fairest 
she ought to go 
and the was longing to see her 
the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of good-will 
22nd as 
it would be a real satisfaction 
but the connciounneu of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to anything jane might communicate 
she went 
she had driven once nnmcceatfully m the door but had not been into the house since the morning after box hill when poor jane had been in such distress as had called her with companion though all the worst of her offering had been unsuspected 
the fear of being still unwelcome determined her though assured of their being at home to wait in the passage and send up her name 
she heard petty announcing it 
but no such bustle succeeded as poor miss yates had before made so happily intelligible 
no 
the heard nothing but the instant reply of 
be her to walk up 
a and a moment afterwards she was mention the more by jane herself coming eager 
forward as if no other reception of her were felt in silent 
emma had never seen her look so well so lovely so engaging 
there was consciousness animation and warmth 
there was everything which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted 
she came forward with an ordered hand 
and said in a low but very feeling one this in most kind indeed 
miss warehouse it is i be for me to vex hem 
i ho will believeiolsiuxcuoe me for being so entirely sleithyglll’t word emma was gratitude and would soon have shewn no want of words if the sound of mrs westons voice from the sitting-room had not checked her and made it expedient to comprise all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very very earnest shake of die hand 
mrs gates and mrs westons were together 
miss yates was out which accounted for the previous tranquillity 
emma could have wished mr eton esteems 
-5 where 
but she was in 3 humour to have patience with everybody 
and as mrs eton met her with unusual graciousness she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm 
she soon believed herself to penetrate mr elliot's thoughts and understand why the was like herself in happy spirits 
it wan being in miss f airfax’e confidence and fancying himself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people 
emma law symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face 
and while paying her own compliment to my barns and appearing to attend to the good old lady s replies she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery folded up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to miss fair and return it into the purple and gold ridicule by her side saying with significant nods 
a we can finish this name other time you know 
you and i shall not want opportunities 
and in fact you have heard all the essential already 
i only wanted to prove to you that my s. admit our apology and is not offended 
you see how delightfully she writes 
oh she is a meet creature 
you would have doted on her had you gone 
— but not a word more 
let us be dearest 
quite on our good behaviour 
— ah l 
you remember those linen 
i forget the power at this moment 
‘forwhen a lady in the use you know all other thing give place now i say my dear in our cause for dab read 
hum 
a word to the wise 
i am in a one now of spirits an't i 
butlwautroletyonrheartateaaeuro man s 
if representation you see quite pleased her 
and again on emma merely turning her head to look at my barns sitting she added in a half whisper a corruption of “reticule.” 
— joulrwn’n decorum 
22nd trusts 
a i mention no ones you will observe 
oh no 
cautions as a sister of state 
i managed it extremely wdl.’1 emma could not doubt 
it was a pass leg display repeated on every possible occasion 
hen they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and mrs woodston she found herself amply addressed with 
a do not you think miss warehouse our such little friend here is charmingly recovered 
do not you diinkhercuredoesperrythehighestcredit 
a here a side glance of game meaning at jane 
a pass my word parry has restored her in a wonderful short time 
oh ifyouhadaeenher aside whenohewasatthe worst 
a and when mrs yates was saying something to emma whispered farther 3 we do not my i word of any guidance that parry might have 
not a word of a certain young physician from winds 
oh no party shall have all the credit i have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you miss warehouse she shortly afterwards began 1 since the party to box hill 
very pleasant by 
but yet i think there wan something wanting 
smiling did not seem 
that is there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some 
so it appcm'cd to me at least but i might be mistaken 
however i think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again 
what say you both to our collecting the company and exploring the box hill again while the fine weather lamp 
it must he the more party you know 
quite the slave party not one exception 
soon after this miss hates arise in and emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself resulting the supposed from doubt of what might be said and impatience to my everything 
thank you dear miss warehouse you are all me 
-5 kindness 
it in impossible to nay 
yes indeed i quite understand 
dearest jane prospects 
that in i do not mean 
but she is charmingly recovered 
how in mr woodhousel i am so glad 
quite out of my power 
— such a happy little circle as you and on hem 
yes indeed 
— charming young man l 
that is 
so very friendly 
i mean good mr parry 
— such attention to jane 
a and from her great her more than commonly thankful delight towards mrs eton for being there emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment toward jane from the village quarter which we now graciously overcome 
— 
— after a few whispers indeed which placed it beyond a guess mrs eton speaking louder said 
yes here i am my goodﬁierid 
and here i have been so long that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologize 
but the truth i that i am waiting for 
i my lord and water 
he promised to join me here an yes his respect to 
a hat 
nrewetohaoil‘ethepleamreofa call from mr eton 
twill be a favour indeed 
for i know gentlemen do not like morning visit and mr eton time is so engaged 
upon my word it it miss hates 
he really is engaged from morning to night 
there in no end of couples coming to him on some presence or other 
he magistrate and foreseen and churchwardens are always wanting his opinion 
they seem not able to do anything without him 
a upon my word mr e. 8 i often say rather you than i. i do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument if i had half is many applicant bad enough a it in for l absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree 
i believe i have not played a bad this fortnight 
however he is coming i nature in yet indeed on purpose to wait on you all 
an jumping up her hand 2 mr 
to screen her words from emma 
a congratulatory visit it know 
oh 
mite indispensable miss hate looked aboyrretyhcelr so happily 
she promised to come to me at noon she could disengage herself from nightly 
but he and knights are insult up together in deep consultation 
mr e 
in knightley’l right hand emma would not have iii-riled for world and could mind a in mr eton gone on foot to dwell 
e will have a hot walk 
oh no it in a meeting at the crown 
a regular meeting 
woodston and close will be there too 
but one is apt to speak only of those who lead 
i fancy mr e 
and knights have everything their own way a have not you mistaken the day 
a said emma 
a i am almost certain that the meeting at the crown in not till to-morrow 
mr nightly was at hatfield yesterday and spoke of it a for saturday a oh no the meeting is certainly to-day a was the abrupt answer which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on mr westons tide 
a i do believe the continued this is the most troublesome parish that ever was 
we never heard of inch things at male grove a your parish there was small a aid jane 
upon my word my dear i do not know for i never heard the subject talked of 
a but it in proved by the miles of the cool which i have heard you speaks of an under the patronage of your linger and mrs begged 
the only cool and not more than five-and-twenty children a ah 
you clever creature that a very true 
what a thinking brain you have 
i say jane what a fact character you and i should make if we cool he taken together 
my loveliness and your solidity would produce perfection 
not that i presume to insinuate emma 
23 however that m people may not think jot perfection already 
but hush 
— 
not a word if you pleasure it seemed an unnecessary caution 
jane was wanting to give her words not to mr eton but to miss house an the inner plainly law 
the wish of distinguishing her an far a civility permitted wan very evident though it could not often proceed beyond a look 
mr westons made still appearance 
he lad missed him with some of her sparkling vivacity 
my g ve pretty sir upon word 
to send me on here to an encumbrance w my friends so long be 
for you vouchsafed to come 
but you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with 
you knew i should not stir till my lord and matter appeared 
here have i been sitting thin hour giving those young ladies a sample of true conjugal obeisance 
for who can lay you know how soon it may he wanted 
a mr eton war no hot and tired that all this wit seemed thrown away 
his civilities to the other ladiemuatbepaid 
buthiuuhoequent oh was to lament over itself over the heat he was an ring and walk he had had for nothing 
7 a when i got to deny/ell said he 
nightly could not be found 
very odd 
very unaccountable 
after the note i lent him thin morning and the message he returned that he should certainly be at home till one 
well 
cried his wife 
a my dear mr e. you have not been to dwell 
you mean the crown 
you come now the meeting at the crown 19 a no no that to-morrow 
and i particularly wanted to one nightly to-day on that very account 
such a dreadful bring morning 
i went over the helps too speaking in a tone of great ill usage which made it so much the want 
and then not to and 20 em 
him-theme 
i aseureyoo i am not at alleged 
and no apology left no manage for me 
the housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected 
very extraordinary 
and nobody knew at all which way he was gone 
perhaps to hatfield ﬁrhagvto the abbey mill shape into his woods 
in oodhorue this is not 
like our friend nightly can you explain it 
a emma amused herself by promoting that it was very extraordinary indeed and that she had not a syllable to a for him 
a can not imagine said mr eton feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do i can not imagine how he could do inch 3 thing by you of all people in the world 
the very last son whom one should expecttobeforgotten 
dear e. must have left a message for you i am sure he must 
not even nightly could be to very eccentric 
and his servants forgot it 
depend upon it that wan the case 
and very likely to with the unwell servant who are all i have of ten observed extremely awkward and remain 
i am sure i would not have such a creature an his harry and at our sideboard for an consideration 
and an for mrs hodges right he ll her ve cheap indeed 
she promised wight a receipt never tent is a i met william park a continued mr eton a as i got near the house and he told me i should not and his matter at home but i did not believe him 
william seemed rather out of humour 
he did not know what was come to hit matter lately he laid but he could hardly ever get the speech of him 
i have nothing to do with william want but it really is of very great importance that i should see nightly to-day 
and it becomes a matter therefore of very serious inconvenient that 1 should have had thin hot walk to no purpose nun 
23 emma felt that she could not do better than go homedirectl

reserved from sinking deeper in oppression toward 
1 
westons if not towards william larkins.” she was pleased on taking leave to and miss f airs determined to attend her out of the room to go with her even downstairs 
it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of to lay 
a it is as well perhaps that i have not had the possibility 
had you not surrounded by other friends i might have been tempted to introduce a subject to ask questions to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct 
i feel that i should certainly have been impertinent 
oh i a cried jane with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure 
a there would have been no danger 
the danger would have been of my varying you 
you could not have gained me more than by expressing an interest 
— indeed miss warehouse a more collectedly 4 with the consciousness which i have of misconduct 
very great misconduct 
it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends whose good opinion is man worth preserving are not disgusted no such a degree as to 
i have not time for half that i could wish to my 
i long to make a lodges excuses to urge something for myself 
i feel it so very due 
but unfortunately 
in short fan compassion does not stand my friend 
7 a oh i you are too scrupulous indeed you are cried emma warmly and taking her hand 
a you owe me no apologies

23 chapter 13 
mrs westons friends were all made happy by her safety 
and if the satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to emma it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl 
she had been decided in wishing for a miss watson 
she would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her hereafter with either of inbelia’s sons 
but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best 
it would he a great comfort to mr westons as he grew older 
and even mr westons might be growing older ten years hence 
to have his preside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home 
and mrs westons 
ho one could doubt that a daughter would he most to her 
and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach should not have their powers in exercise again 
she has had the advantage you know of practising on me a she continued 
like la baronet lane on la compressed d’ostalis in shame de genius ‘adelaide and there a and we shall now see her own little decide educated on a more perfect plan 
a that is a replied mr nightly 
she will indulge her even more than she did you and believe that she does not indulge her at all 
it will he the only diﬂ‘erence.” poor child 
cried emma 
at that rate what will become of her 
a nothing very bad 
the fate of thousands 
she will he disagreeable in infancy and correct herself as she grows older 
i am losing all my bitterness against it children my dearest emma 
i who am owing i my happiness to you would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them 9 36 rum 
emma law bed and replied 5 but i had the assistance of all your endeavour to counteract the indulgence of other people 
i doubt whether my own sense would have connected me without it 
do you 
i have no doubt 
nature gave you understanding 
miss taylor gave you principles 
you must have done well 
my interference was quite as likely to do harm as good 
it was very natural for you to say ‘whatrighthashe to lecture men and i am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner 
i do not believe i did you any the good was all to myself by making you an object of the tendered 
anecdote to me 
i could not think about you to much without dealing on you faults and all 
and by dint of fancying so many errors hue been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least “iamrureyouwereof use to me cried emma 
a i wan often influenced rightly by you 
oftener thankful own at the time 
i am ve sure you did me good 
and if poor little anne easton so he it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me except falling in love with her when she is thirteen 
how often when you were a girl have you said to me with one of your saucy looks 
a mr nightly i am going to do to-and-so 
papa any i may a or i have in taylors leave 
something which you knew i did not approve 
in such cases my interference was giving you two had feelings instead of one 7 a what an amiable creature i was 
no wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance -5 mr nightly 1 you always called me 
a mr nightly 
a and from habit it has not so very formal a emma 
20 sound 
andyetitisforrnal 
wanton to call me something else but i do not know what a i remember once calling you george 2 in one of my amiable stay about ten years ago 
i did it because i thought it would attend you 
but as you made no objection i never did it again a and can not you call me a george 2 now 
a 
impossible i never can call you anything but a mr knightley.’ i will not promise even to equal the elegant tendency of mrs eton by calling you mr t 
but i will promise 2 she added presently laughing and blushing i will promise to call you once by your christian name 
i do not say when but perhaps you may guess where 
in the building in which 
takes m. for better for worse emma grieved that she could not he more openly just to one important service which his her sense would have rendered her to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies 
44 wilful intimacy with harriet smith 
but it was too tender a subject 
she could not enter on it 
harriet was very seldom mentioned between them 
this on his side might merely proceed from her not being thought of 
but emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy and a suspicion from some appearances that their friendship were declining 
she was aware herself that parting under any other circumstances they certainly should have corresponded more and that her intelligence would not have rested as it now almost wholly did on isabella letters 
he might observe that it was so 
the pain of having obliged to a concealment towards him was very little inferior to the pain of having made harriet unhappy 
isabella lent quite as good no account of her visitor as could he expected 
on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits which appeared perfectly 36 main 
natural a there war a. design to be consulted 
but time that business had been over be did not appear to and harriet different from what the had known her before 
isabella to be sure was no very quick observer 
yet if harriet had not been equal to playing with the children it would not have escaped her 
emma comforts and hopes were most amiable carried on by harriet being to any longer 
her night was likely to be a month at least 
mr and mr john nightly were to come down in august and she was invited to remain well they could bring her back 
john does not even mention your friend a laid mr nightly 
a here it hit answer if you like to see it 
it wan the answer to the communication of i intended marriage 
emma as it with a very eager hand with an impatience all live to know what he would say about it and not a all checked by hearing that her friend wan mentioned 
john enter like a brother into my happiness continued mr knights but he in no complimented 
and though i well know him to have likewise a most brotherly affection for you he is so far from making nourishes 
that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise 
but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes 4 he writes like a sensible man a replied emma when the had read the letter 
a i honour i sincerely 
it ll very plain that he coming the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side but that he is not without hope of my gown in time a worthy of your affection at you think me ready 
had he said anything m bear a different construction i should not have believed him 
a my emma he meant no such thing 
he only man 
a 4 he and i could discern very little in our estimation in 
47 of the two 1 
interrupted she with a sort of serious mile 
a much less perhaps than he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject 
a emma my dear emma 7 a oh l 6 the cried with more thorough gaiety if you use your brother does not do justice only wait till my father is in the secret and hear his opinion 
depend upon it he will be much farther from doing you he will think all the happiness all the advantage on your side of the question 
all the merit on mine 
i wish i pity not sink into poor man with him at once 
is tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther ah 
4 he cried a i wish our father might half as easily convinced as john will be of our having every right that equal worth can give to be happy together 
i am amused by one part 
of john letter 
did you notice it 
— 
where he says that my information did not take him wholly by surprise 
that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind 1 if i understand your brother he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying 
he had no idea of me 
he seems perfectly unprepared for that 
yes yes 
but i am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings 
what has been judging by 
i am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another 
but it was to i suppose 
dare say there was a difference when i was staying with them the other day 
i believe i did not play with the children quite so much as usual 
i remember one evening the poor boys dying uncle seems always tired now a the time was coming when the new 
many spread farther and other persons reception of it tried 
as soon as mrs westons was mﬂiciently recovered to admit 1

but mr nightly was to come at each a time and follow up the beginning the wan to make 
she was forced to speak and no cheerfully too 
she must notmakeltarnore nthjectofmiurytohinyhy a melancholy tone herself 
she must not appear to think it a misfortune 
with all the spirit the could command the prepared him hint for nothing strange and then in a few words aid that if his consent and approbation could he ohuined~which the trotted would he attended with no difficulty since it w a plan to promote the of all 
the and mr nightly meant to marry 
by which meant hatfield would receive the common addition of that persona company whom she knew he loved next to his daughter and mr westons best in the world 
poor man l 
it was at lists a considerable shock to him and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it 
she wan reminded more than once of having always l aid she would never marry and assured that it wo d be a great deal better for her to remain single 
and told of poor isabella and poor miss taylor 
but it would not do 
emma hung about him aﬁecﬁonately and smiled andaaiditmuuheeo 
and that he must notclauher with isabella and mr eton whose marriages taking them from hatfield had indeed made a melancholy change but she was not going from mansfield 
she should he always there 
the war introducing no change in their number or their comfort but for the better 
and the wanverymrethathe wouldbeagrear deal the united 39 happier for having mr nightly also at hand when he were once got need to the idea 
it he not love mr nightly very much 
he would not deny that he did she was sure 
whom did he ever want to conduct on business but mr nightly 
who war so useful tom who to ready to write his linen who so glad to in him 
who so cheerful so attentive to attached to him 
would not he like to have him always on the spot 
yes 
that was all very true 
mr nightly could not be there too often 
he should glad to see him every day 
but they see him everydayuitwas 
by couldtheynot go on as the had done 
i woodhotue could not be soon reconciled 
but the worst was overcome the idea war given 
time and continual repetition must do the rent 
to emma entreaties and assurances succeeded mr knightlefa whose fond praise of her over the subject even a kind of welcome 
and be war soon need to be talked to by each on every fair omission 
they had all the assistance which isabella could give by letters of the strangest approbation 
and mr westons was ready on the list meeting to consider the subject in the most serviceable light 
first an a settled and secondly as a good one 
— well aware of the near equal importance of the two recommendations to rwoodhouse'l mind 
it was agreed upon a what was to be 
and everybody by whom he wan used to he guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it he began to think that some time or other in another year or two perhaps it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place 
mr westons wan acting no part finding no feelings in all that ill said to him in favour of the event 
she had been extremely surprised never more so than when emmalirotopened thealfairto her 
but the saw in it too evila 
only increase of happiness to all and had no temple in urging himtntheutmmt 
she had such a regard for mr nightly an to think be deterred even her dear emma 
and it war in every respect to proper suitable and unexceptionable a connection and in one respect one point of the highest importance to peculiarly e give no singularly fortunate that now it occurred an if emma could not rather have attached himself to any other creature and that she had herselfbeen the no idea of being not having thought of it and wish it long ago 
howveryfewofthoeemenina rankoflife to address emma would have renounced their own home for hatfield 
and who but mr nightly could know and bear with mr woodhouaeno at to make inch an arrangement desirable 
the difficulty of doing of poor mr woodhouae had been always felt in her husband plan and her own for a marriage between frank and emma 
how to settle the claims of welcome and hatfield had been a continual impediment 
let acknowledged by mr westons than by herself 
but even he had never been able to banish the better than by laying 
those material take care of themselves 
the young people will and a way but here there was nothing to be shifted of in a wild speculation on the future 
it was all right all open all equal 
no notice on any ride worth the name 
it war a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself and without one real rational difficulty to oppose or delay it 
mr weeks with her baby on her knees indulging in such reflections 
an these was one of the happiest women in the world 
if anything could increase her delight it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its lines set of cape 
the next war universally a surprise wherever it read 
and mr westons had his live minutes share of mass 
21 it 
but five minutes were enough to familiarized the idea to his quickness of mind 
he saw the ndvauuges of the match and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife 
but the wonder of it was very soon nothing 
and by the end of hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it 
a it is to be i secret i conclude 1 said he 
a these matters are always a secret till it is found out that everybody knows them 
only let me be told when i maysgea’k out 
wonder whether jane has abyss son a play he went to highly the next morning and satisfied himself on that point 
he told her the news 
was not she like a daughter his eldest daughter i 
he must tell her 
and miss hates being present it passed of course to mrs cold mrs parrys and mrs ton in meditate afterwards 
it was no more than the principals were prepared for 
she had calculated from the time of its being known at anhalt how soon it would be over l-iighhury 
and were thinking of themselves as the evening wonder in many a family circle with great sagacity 
in general it was a very well-approved match 
some might think him and others might think her the most in luck 
one set might recommend their all removing to unwell and leaving hatfield for the john nightly 
and another might predict disagreement among their servants 
but yet upon the whole there was no serious objection raised except in one habitation 
the village 
there the surprise was not softened by any satisfaction 
mr eton cared little about it compared with his wife 
he only hoped 6 the young lady pride would now be contented and suppose she had always meant to catch knights if she could 
a and on the point of living at hand could during exclaim a rather he than i 
a but 22 ma 
mr eton war we much discomposed indeed a poor knights 
poor fellow 
d heroines for him 
she was extremely concerned 
for though very eccentric he had a thousand good qualities 
how could he be no taken in 9 did not drink him at all in love 
nor in the lean 
poor nightly 
there would he an end of all please intercourse with him 
how happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him 
but that would be all over now 
poor fellow 
no more exploring to dwell made for bars 
oh no 
there would be a mr nightly to throw cold water on everything 
extremely agreeable 
but she war not at all sorry that she had shared the housekeeper the other in 
shocking plan living together 
it would never she knew a family near male grove who had tried it and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quartered hum 1810 
time passed on 
a few more tomorrow and the party from london would be arriving 
i war an alarming change 
and emma wan thinking of it one morning as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her when mr nightly came in and distressing thoughts were put by 
after the em chat of pleasure he was silent 
and then in a graver tone began with 
— i have something to tell you emma

4 he cried 
well 
then having course to her work-basket in excuse for leaning down her like and concealing all the exquisite feeling of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing the added 
well now tell me everything 
make thin intelligible to me 
how when 
when 
letmekuowitall 
i never wan more in prided 
but it does not make me unhappy i assure you 
how 
how has it been possible 
a it in a very simple story 
he went town on busineuthreedayl ago and i got him to take charge of some papers which i in wanting to send to john 
he delivered these pay to john at his chambers and was allied by him to join their party the name evening to aetley’a 
they were going to take the two eldest boy asdey’n

and miss smith 
my friend robert could not ruin 
they called for him in their way 
were all extremely around and my brotheraeked him to dine with them the next day which he did and in the course of that visit an i understand found an opportunity of speaking to harriet 
and certainly did not speak in vain 
she made him her acceptance as happy even as he is deserving 
e came down by yesterday coach and was with me thin morning immediately after breakfast to report to his proceedings burst on my fair and then on his own 
this is all that i can relate of the how where and when 
your friend harriet will make a much longer pinery when rouse her 
she will give you all the minute warm

in our communication we deal only in the great 
however i must by that robert marking hart seemed for line and to on overflowing 
and that he did mention without enabling much to the purpose that on quitting their box at alley my brother took charge of mrs john slightly and little john and he followed with miss smith and henry 
aodthatatonetime there in such a crowd stop make miss smith rather uneasy 
hem emma dared not attempt an immediate reply 
to speahehewas iii who best betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness 
she must wait a moment or he would think her mad 
her absence disturbed him 
and after observing her a little while he added 
emma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy 
but i am afraid it gives you more than you expected 
his situation is an evil 
but you must consider it as what gaieties your friend 
and i will answer for your thinking better andhetterol‘ him as you know him more 
his sense and good principles would delight you 
as far as the man in concerned you could not without friend in hewerhanda 
his rank in society i would alter if i could which is saying a great deal i assure you emma 
you laugh at me about william lurking 
but i could quite an ill spare robert marking 
he wanted her to look up and smile 
and having now brought herself not to smile too readily she did cheerfully answering 
you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match 
i think harriet is doing extremely well 
her connexions may be worse than by in respectability of character there can be no doubt that they are

but hardly had they been told of the baby and mr sooth received the then for coming which he asked for when a line was caught through the blind of two courses passing near the window

emma extremely glad to see him 
but there was a degree of confusion a number embarrassing recollections on each die 
they met and raising but with a consciousness which at lists allowed little to be laid 
and having all sat down again there was for some time such a blank in the circle that emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulge e which the had long felt of seeing frank church once more and of seeing him with jane would yield its proportion of pleasure 
when mr westons joined the party however and when the baby fetched there was no longer a want of subject or animation or of courage and opportunity for frank church to draw me her and lay

let me rum your congratulations 
i assure you that i have heard the news with the warm interest and satisfaction 
he is a man whom i can not resume to praise 
emma was delighted and only wanted him to go on in the same style 
but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own jane and his next words were 
did you ever lee such a skin 
such smoothness such delicacy and yet without being actually fair 
one can not call her fair 
it is a most uncommon complexion with her dark eyelashes and hair 
a most distinguishing complexion 
so regularly the lady in it 
just colour enough for beauty i have always admired her complexion replied emma archly 
but do not i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale 
when we first began to talk of her 
have you quite forgotten 
a oh no 
what an impudent dog i wall 
how could i dare 5 but he laughed no heartily at the recollection that emma could not help saying 
— 
i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexity at that time you had very great amusement in tricking us all 
i am sure you had 
i am sure it was a consolation to you 
oh no no no

this war her history

23 singularly interesting it was to mr warehouse who commended her very much sir thinking of sending for parrys and only regretted that she had not done it 
a she should always send for parrys if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered were it only for a moment 
she could not be too soon alarmed nor send for parrys too often 
it was a pity perhaps that he had not came last i t

and while she joined in the laugh 
it was evident from james countenance that she too was really hearing him though trying to seem deaf

i can never think of it without laughing 
she hears us she hears us miss warehouse 
i see it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown

do not you see that at this instant the very passage of her own letter which sent me the report is trying under her eye 
that the whole blunder is spread are her 
that she can attend to nothing else though pretending to listen to the others pop 
jane was forced to smile completely for a moment 
and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him and said in a conscious low et steady voice

m 25 emma 
tauntingly 
but emma feelings were chiefly with jane in the argument 
and on leaving rascally and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men the felt that pure as had been to ice frank church and really regarding him as she did with friends the had never been more sensible of mr knight eyes high superiority of character 
the happiness of this most happy day received it completion in the animated contemplation of his worth which thin comparison produced

f emma had still at intervals an anxious feeling for harriet a momentary doubt of in being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to mr slightly and really able to accept another man from unbiassed inclination it was not long that the had to augur from the recurrence of any such uncertainty 
a very day brought the party from london 
and the had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with harriet than she became perfectly satisfied unaccountable as it war that robert maria had thought uuppluntt d mr nightly 
and was now forming at her views of harp list 
harriet was a little distressed 
did look a little pools at first but having once owned that she had been presumption and silly and ielf-deceived before her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words and leave her without a care for the put and with the fullest exultation in the present and future for an to her friends approbation emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations 
harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at aatley'u and the em 
a 30 dinner the next day 
the could dwell on it all with the utmost delight but what did such particulars explain 
the fact wan an emma could now acknowledge that harriet had always liked robert hilarity 
and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible 
beyond thin it must ever be unintelligible to emma 
the event however wan most joy full 
and every day wan giving her fresh reason for thinking so 
married 
parsonage became known 
she proved to be the daughter of a tradesman rich enough to aﬂ'cn‘l her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been here and decent enough to have always wished for concealment 
such was the blood of gentility which emma had formerly been in ready to vouch for 
it won likely to be a untasted perhaps an the blood of many a gentleman but what a connection had she been preparing for mr nightly or for the chinchilla or even for mr eton 
the stairs of illegitimacy unsearched by nobility or wealth would have been a strain indeed 
no objection was rained on the father s side 
the young man war treated liberally 
it was all an it should be 
and a emma became acquainted with robert maria who wan now introduced at hatfield the fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth-while could hid forget for her little friend 
she had no doubt of harriet happiness with any good-tempered man 
but with him and in the home he offered there would be the hope of more of security civility and improvement she would be placed in the midst of those who loved her and who had better sense than herself 
retired enough for safety and occupied enough for cheerfulness 
she would he never led into temptation nor left for it to and her out 
she would be respectable and happy 
and emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world to have created to steady and persevering an affection in such 26 inn 
a nun 
or if not quite the luckiest to yielding to herself 
harriet necessarily drawn away by her engagement with the parting 
was less and less at hatfield which war not to he regretted 
the intimacy between her and emma insult risk 
their friendship must change into a calmer sort of good-will 
and fortunately what ought to be and must he seemed already beginning and in the most gradual natural manner 
before the end of september emma attended harriet to church and saw her hand bestowed on robert maria with so complete a satisfaction at no remembrances even connected with mr clifton at he wood before them could impaired 
perhaps indeed at that does she scarcely saw mr eton but as the clergyman who being at the altar might next fall on herself 
robert maria and harriet smith the latest couple engaged of the three were the lines to be married 
jane fairest had heard quitted higher and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the campbell 
the mr churchilla were also in town 
and they were only waiting for november 
the intermediate month was the one fixed on as far as they dared by emma and mr nightly 
they had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while john and isabella were ill at hatfield to allow them the fortnight's been in a tour to the sea-air which war the plan 
john and isabella and every other friend were agreed in approving it 
but mr oodhouxhhow was mr woodhonae to be induced to connect l 
he who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event 
when first made on the subject he war to miracle that they were almost by less 
a second allusion indeed gave less pain 
began to think it was to be and that he could not prevent it 
a very prominent 
24 in step of the mind on its way to resignation 
still however he was not happy 
nay he and is much otherwise that his daughters courage end 
she could not hear to one him murdering 
to know him fancying himself neglected 
and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assume of both the mr nightly that when once the event were over his dines would be soon over too the hesitated 
she could not proceed 
in thin state of suspense the were befriended not by any sudden illumination of m woodhouee’e mind or any wonderful change of his 
nervous listen but by the operation of the name yates in another way 
mr westons poultry-house was robbed one night of all her turkiehvidently by the ingenuity of man 
other poultry 
yard in the neighbourhood also suffered 
differing was hearth-tall to mr woodhouse’s fears 
he wan very uneasy 
and but for the sense of his son-in-law protection would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life 
the strength resolution and presence of mind of the mr nightly commanded his fullest dependence 
while either of them protected him and hit hatfield war safe 
but mr john nightly must be in london again by the end of the first week in november 
the result of this dinner was that with a much more voluntary cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to ho for at the moment the was able to vex her wedding-day 
and mr eton war called on within a month from the marriage of mr and mr robert maria to join the hands of mr knights and in woodhounc 
the wedding was very much like other weddings where the nice have no taste for misery or parade 
and mrs eton from the particulars detailed by her husband thought it all extreme baby and very 28 sun 
for to her own 
very little white in very few lace veils 
a most pill business 
eliza would are when she heard of it 
but in quit of these deficiencies the kitchen the hope the confidence the pen dictiontofthemﬂbandofuuefriendnwlw viewed the ceremony were fully awed in the perfect happiness of the union
