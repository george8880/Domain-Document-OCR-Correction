of one who had ever seen catherine norland in her infancy would have opposed her born to he an heroine 
her situation in life the character of her father and mother her own person and disposition were all equally against her 
her father was a clergyman without being neglected or s and a very respectable man though his name wan carts and he had never been handsome 
he had a considerable independence besides two good livings and he was not in the least addicted to suckling s his daughters 
her mother wan a woman of useful pay a sense with a good temper and what is more remarkable with a good constitution 
she had three sons before catherine was born 
and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world as any body might expect she still lived on 
lived to have six children more 
to see them growing up around her and to enjoy excellent health herself 
a family often children will be always called a fine family where there are heads and arms and enough for the number 
but the norland had iii other right to the word for they were in general very plain and catherine for many years of her life as plain as any 
she had i thin awkward figure i allow skin 2 northanger abbey 
without colour dark sank hair and strong features 
so much for her person and not less unptopitionl for heroism seemed her mind 
she was fond of all a gayest and greatly preferred chicken not merely to do is t to the more heroine enjoyment of infancy nursing a donnouoe feeding a canary-bird or altering a roses 
indeed the had no taste for a garden and if she owes at all it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief at least no it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she wan forbidden to make 
such were her propensities 
her were quite as exuaordina 
she never could learn or understand anything before she was taught and sometimes not even then for the was often inattention and occasionally study it 
her mother was three months in teaching her on ay to repeat the 1 beggar'l petition 1 and after all her next sister sally could say it hem than she did 
not that catherine was always l stupid 
by no means 
she learnt the table of 6 the are and many friends as quickly as my girl in england 
her otherwise her to learn music 
and catherine was sure she should like it for she was very fond of thinking the keys of the old forlorn spinet so at eight years old she an 
she learnt a year and could not bear it 
and mrs world who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in spite of capacity or dictate allowed her to leave of 
the day which dismissed the musician was one of the of catherine s life 
her taste for drawing war not superior 
though whenever she could obtain the outside a later from brother or sense upon any other odd piece of paper she did what she could in that way by drawing homes and three hens and chicken all very much like one another 
writing and account she was taught by her father 
french by her mother 
her prudence in either was not remarkable and are shield her lawns in both northanger abbey 
3 whenever she could 
what a strange accountable character 
for with all these symptoms of privacy at ten years old she had neither a bad heart debt a had temper was seldom abhor cared ever quarrelsome and very kind to the little ones with interruptions of tyranny 
she was moreover noisy and wild hated contentment and clearness and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the green slope at the hack of the house 
such was catherine balland at ten 
at fifteen appearancesweremending 
she began to curlherhair and long for balls her complexion improved her unites were softened by plumpness and colour her eyes gained more animation and i her figure more consequence 
her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for only and she grew clean as she grew smart 
she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her usual in governing 
a catherine grows quite a good-looking girl 
she is almost pretty to-day 1 were words which caught her can now and then 
and how welcome were the sounds 
to look alarm pop is an acquisition of higher delight to a girl who hat looking plain the first fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her oracle can ever receive 
mrs norland was a very good woman and wished to see her children everything they ought to be but her time was so much occur led in lying-in and teaching the little ones that her 1 her daughters were inevitably left to shift for themselves 
and it was not very wonderful that catherine who had by nature nothing heroine about her should prefer chicken hate ball riding on horses back and running about the county at the age of fourteen to books or at least books information in provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be gained from then provided they were all marys and no 
4 northanger abbey 
reflection she had never any objection to books at all 
but from often to seventeen she was in calling for a heroine 
she food all such works as heroism must read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so serviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their uneventful lives 
from pope she law to censure those who a bar shut the misery of woe from gray that i'mmysﬂmi-borntohlushumem and “sultfngrlneeontheduen air forlorn thomson that ... it is s delightful ask to such the young idea how to me from shakspeomshegainedsgrwmofinformation amongst the rest that

talks patience on a moment smiling us grief 
so far her improvement was sufficient and in my other points she came on exceedingly well 
for though she could not write senses she brought herself to read them 
and though there seemed no chance of her throwing a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the piano-forte of her own composition she could listen to northanger abbey 
5 other people performance with very little fatigue 
her greatest deficiency was in the pencil 
the had no notion of drawing 
mot enough even to attempt a stretch of her lover s prove that the might be detected in the design 
there she fell miserably short of the true heroine height 
at present she did not know her own poverty for she had no lover to country 
she had reached the age of mention without having seen one amiable youth who could call forth her gentility without having inspired one real passion and without having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate and very ancient 
this was strange indeed 
but strange things may be generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out 
there was not one lord in the neighbourhood 
no not even a manner 
there wan not one family among their acquaintance who had feared and supposed a boy accidentally found at their door 
not one young man whose was unknown 
her ﬁtherhadmwardandthesquireofthepaﬁdrno children 
a but when a young lady it to he a heroine the perveneneea of forty surrounding families can not prevent her 
something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way 
mr allies who owned the chief of the property about fullest the village in wiltshire where the norland lived was ordered to bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution 
and hii_lady a good-humoured woman fond of miss morton and probably aware that if advantages will not befall a young lady in her own village the most seek them abroad invited her to go with them 
mr and mr 
norland were all compliance and catherine all happiness

no addition to what has been already said of catherine norland pencil and mental endowrnenu when about to be laughed into all the difficulties and dangers of dxweeka’ residence in but may be elated for the tender more certain information lent the following pages should otherwise fail of giving any idea 
of what her character is meant to he that her heart wan affectionate her disposition cheerful and open without conceit or affectation of any kind 
her manners just removed from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl 
her person pleasing and when in good luck 
pretty 
and her mind about at ignorant and uninformed up the female mind at seventeen really is 
when the hour of departure drew near 
the maternal anxiety of my regard will be naturally supposed to be most severe 
a thousand alarming preeentirnenu of evil to her beloved catherine from that terrible reparation must oppress her hurt with address and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together 
and advice of the most important and applicants nature must of course bow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet

who would not think no 
but mr norland knew to little lords and baronet that she entertained no notion of their general mischievous and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her draw her from their machinationa 
her actions were confined to the following into a i beg catherine you will always wrap yourself up very warmly about the throat when on come from soon aright

it ll remarkable however that the neither insisted on catherine writing by every poet nor expected her promise of transmitted the character of every new acquaintance nor a detail of every interesting conversation that 
bath might produce 
everything indeed relative to thin important journey we done on the part of the norland with a degree of moderation and composure which seemed rather cloth with the common feelings of common life than with the reined sincepdbilitiet 
the tender emotions which the first separation of a heroine from her family ought always to excite 
her father instead of giving her an animated order on banter or even putting an hundred pounds hank-bill into her hands gave her only ten guinea and promised her more when she wanted it 
under these unpromising suspect the parting took place and the journey began 
it wan reformed with suitable quite and uneventful safety 
either robert nor term em befriended them nor one lucky venture to its use them to the hero 
nothing more alarming occurred than a fear on my allies s side of having once left her legs behind her at an inn and that fortunately proved to be groundless 
they arrived at bath

it is now expedient to give some description of mrs allies that the reader my be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter tend to promote the general distress of the work and how the will probably contribute to reduce poor catherine to all the desperate wretchedness of which a last volume is capable 
whether by her imprudence vulgarity or jealousy 
whether by interrupting her letters ruining her s or turning her out of doors 
mrs allies was one of thatnumemosdau of females whose society can raise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the world who could like them well enough to marrythem 
she ll neither beauty genius accomplishment nor manner 
the air of a gentlewoman a great deal of quiet invective good temper and a trifling turn of mind were all that could account for her being the choice of a sensible intelligent man like mr allies 
in one respect he was admirably attend to introduce a young lady into public being as fond of going everywhere and seeing everything herself as any young lady could he 
dress was her passion 
she had a most harmless delighting being one 
and our heroine entry into life could not take place till after three or four days had been spent in leaning what was mostly worn and her chaperon was provided with a dress of the newest fashion 
catherine too niadeaomepurchaaesherself andwhenallthese matters were arranged the important evening came which was to usher her into the upper rooms 
her hair was cut and dressed by the best hand her clothes put on with care and both mrs fallen and her maid declared she looked nice as she should do 
with such encouragement therein hoped at lean to pass censured through the crowd 
as for admiration it was always very welcome when it came but she did not depend on it

9 mrs allies was so long in presuming that they did not enter the ballroom till late 
the sense was full the room crowded and the two ladies seemed in well as they could 
as for mr allies he repaired directly to the card-room and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves 
with more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of her protegee mrs allies made her way through the thing of men by the door as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow 
catherine however lent close at her side and liked her arm too limits within her friends to bear asunder by any common effort of a struggling assembly 
but to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along the room was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd 
it seemed rather to increase as they went on 
whereas she had imagined that when once fairly within the door they should easily seats and be able to watch the dances with perfect convenience 
but thin was far from being the case 
and though by unwearied diligence they gained even the top of the room their situation was just the same they saw nothing of the dancers but the high feathers of come of ill ladies 
still they moved on something better was yet in view 
and by a continued exertion of strength and ingenuity they found themselves at last in the passage behind the highest bench 
here there was something less of crowd than below 
and hence miss morlandhad a cot retentive view of all the company beneath her i and us all the dangers of her late get through them 
a it was a splendid sight 
and she gain for the ﬁrsttime 1 that evening to feel herself at a hall she longed to i dance but she had not an act acquaintance in the room 
v man allies did all that she so d do in such a cause by saying very plainly every now and then a i wish you dance my dear 
i wish on could get banners 1 for some time her young friend felt obliged to her for -5 ... 
he l i or northanger abbey 
these wishes but they were red asked so often and raved so totally ineffectual that catherine grew tired at last and would thank her no more 
they were not long able however to enjoy the repose of the eminence they had so laborious gained 
everybody was shortly in motion for ten and they must spread out like the rest 
catherine 11 to feel something of disappointment she was tired of being continually pressed against by people the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to interest and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that should not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a syllable with any of her fellows ives 
and when at last arrived in the tea-board she et yet more the awkwardness of having no party to join no acquaintance to claim no gentleman to assist them 
they as nothing of mr allies 
and after looking about them in vain for a more eligible situation were obliged to sit down at the end of a table at which a large party were already placed without having anything to do there or anybody to speak to except each other 
mrs allies congratulated herself as soon as they were seated on having preserved her gown from injury 
it would have been very shocking to have it tom 1 said she 
would not it 
it is such a delicate muslin 
for my part i have not seen anything i like so well in the whole room i assure you 
a how uncomfortable it is whispered a not to have a single acquaintance here 
7 a yes my dear replied mrs allied with perfect permit a it is very uncomfortable indeed a hat shall we do 
the gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here 
we seem forcing ourselves into their 
aye so we do 
that is very agreeable 
i wish we had a large acquaintance here catherine norteanger abbey 
i l 1 i wish we had an 
it would be somebody to go on very true my dear 
and ifweltuew anybody 1 would join them directly 
the sisters were here last year 
i wish they were here town had not we letter away as it in 
tea-things for us you see no more there are indeed 
how very provoking 
but i think we had better sit still for one gets assembled in such a crowd 
how in my head my dear 
somebody gave me a push that has hurt it i am afraid so indeed it looks very nice 
but dear mrs allies are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people 
i think you must know mebody.” i doat upon my word 
i wish i did 
i wish i had a large acquaintance here with all my heart and then i should get you a partner 
i should be so glad to have you dance 
there goes a strange-looking woman 
what an odd gown she hat got on how old-fashioned it in 
look at the back 
a after some time they received an offer of tea from one of their neighbours 
it was thanks accepted and this introduced a light conversation with the gentleman who offered it which was the only one that anybody spoke to them during the eveningﬁill they were discovered and joined by mr allies when the dance was up 
a well miss world a said he directly a i hope you have had an agreeable ball 
very agreeable indeed a she replied vainly endeavouring to hide a great yawn 
a i wish she had been able to dance a laid his wife 
i wish we could have got a partner for her 
i have been saying how glad i would if the dinner were here this winter instead of last 
or if the party 
here no i 
northanger abbey 
had come as they talked of once she might have danced with george parrys 
i am so sorry be bad not had a partner 
a e shall do better another evening i hope a wan mr allenham consolation 
the company began to disperse when the dancing was over enough to leave space for the remainder to walk about in some comfort 
and now was the time for a heroine who had not yet played a very distinguished part in the events of the evening to be noticed and admired 
every ve minutes by removing name of the crowd gave greater opening for her charms 
she was now seen by my young men who had not been near her before 
not one however mad with rapturous wonder on beholding her no whisper of eager inquiry ran round the more nor was the once called a vanity by anybody 
yet catherine was in very good looks and had the company only seen her three years before they would now have thought her exceedingly handsome 
she war looked at however and with some admiration 
for in her own hearing two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl 
such words had their due effect she immediately thought the evening plea faster than she had found it before her humble vanity was contented 
the felt more obliged to the two young men for this simple plain than a true quality heroine would have been for after fondness in celebnnon of her charms and went to her chair in good humour with everybody and perfectly satisfied with her share of public attention 
northanger abbey 
13 chusing 
very morning now brought in regular duties 
shops were to be visited some new part of the town to he looked at and the pump-room to be attended where they parted up and down for an hour looking at everybody and speaking to no one 
the wish of as numerous acquaintance in bath was still uppermost with mrs fallen and she repeated it after every fresh proof which every morning brought of her knowing nobody at all 
they made their appearance in the lower rooms 
and here fortune was more favourable to our heroine 
the master of the ceremonies introduced to her a very gentleman-like young man as a partner 
his name was tiled 
he seemed to be about four or live and twenty was rather tall had a pleasing countenance a very intelligent and lively e e and if not quite hand was very near it 
is address was good and catherine felt herself in high luck 
there was little leisure for speaking while they danced 
but when they were seated at ten the found him as agreeable as she had already given him credit for being 
he talked with lucy and spirit and there was an archness and pleasantly in his manner which interested though it was hardly understood by her 
after chattering some lime on such matters as naturally arose from the objects around them he suddenly addressed her with 
i have hitherto been very remiss madam in the proper attentions of a partner here 
i have not yet asked you how long you have been in bath whether you were ever here before whether you have been at the upper rooms the theatre and the concert and how you like the place altogether 
i have been very negligent 
but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars 
if you are 
i will begin directly 
14 northanger usher 
a you need not give yourself that trouble sir 
a no trouble i assure you madam then form 
in his features into a set smile and affectedly softening his voice he added with a smiling air 1 have you been long in bath madam 
7 a about a week sir a replied catherine trying not to laugh 
a really l 1 with affected astonishment 
a why should you be surprized sir 
7 a why indeed 3 said he in his natural tone 
a but some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply and surprize is more easily assumed and not less reasonable than any other 
now let us go on 
were you never here before madam to a never stir a indeed 
have you yet honoured the upper rooms l 1 yes sir 
i was there last monday 1 have you been to the theatre 
7 a yes sir 
i was at the play on tuesday a to the concert 
7 a yes sir 
on wednesday 1 and are you altogether pleased with bath -5 7 a yes 
i like it very well a now i must give one smirks and then we my be rational against catherine turned away her head not knowing whether she might venture to laugh 
if i see what you think of me a mind he gravely 
a i shall make but a poor figure in your journey to 
morrow a my journey 
a 
a yes 
i know exactly what you will say 
friday went to the lower rooms 
wore my shrugged 
muslin robe with blue trimming plain black shoes 
appeared to much advantage but was strangely harassed by a 
northanger abbey 
15 queer half-witwd man who would make me dance with him and distressed me by his nonsense 1 indeed i shall say no such thing 
a shall i tell you what you ought to my 2 
a if you please a i danced with a agreeable young man introduced by mr king 
ha a great deal of conversation with him 
seems a most extraordinary genius 
hope i may know more of him 
that madam is what i afraid you to say a but perhaps i keep no journal.” 1 perhaps you are not sitting in this room and i am not sitting ay you 
these are points in which i. doubt is equally possible 
not keep a journey 
how are your absent cousins to understand the honour of your life in bath without one 
how are the civilities and compliments of every day to related as they ought to be unless noted down every evening in a journey 
how are your various dresses to he remembered and the particular state of your complexion and curl of your hair to be described in all their universities without having constant recourse to a journey 
my dear madam i am not so ignorant of young ladies ways as you wish to believe me 
it is this delightful habit of joumalizing which largely contributed to form the easy after of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated 
everybody allow that the talent of writing assemble letters is peculiarly female 
nature may have done something but i am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal.” 1 i have sometimes thought a said catherine doubtingly 1 whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen 
that is i should not think the superiority was always on our side a as far as i have had of opportunity of judging it appears to me that the s style of letter-writing ye 16 nortkanger abbey 
among women is faultless except in three hardening 1 and what are they 
a general deficiency of subject a total invitation to so and a v sent ignorance of grammarian 1 got my vjbyrdfmlq need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment 
you do not think too highly of in that w 
a should no more ay it down at 3 general rule that women write better letter than men than that they sing better duets or draw better landscapes 
in every power of which taste ll the foundation excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sees they were interrupted by mrs allies 
my dear catherine 1 said the 
do take this a out of my sleeves 
i am afraid it but tom 2 hole already 
i shall be quite marry if it hay for this is a favourite gown though it cost but nine shillings a yard 
that i expect what i should have guessed it madam 1 said mr lucy looking it the main 
a do us understand muslins sir i particularly well 
i always buy my own canvass and am allowed to be an excellent judge 
and my sister hat often trusted me in the choice of a gown 
i bought one for her the other day and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it 
i gave but have phillips a yard for it and a true indian muslin on allies was quite struck by his genius 
a men common 
take so little notice of those thing said the 
a can never get mr sullen to know one of my gown from another 
you must be a great comfort to your litter are a i hope i am madam 
a and pray air who do you think of mill norland gown 
a northanger abbey 
i 7 a it is very red madam said he gravely examining it 
but l’ddtlimt think it will wall well 
i am afraid it will tray a how can you said catherine laughing 4 he so 
— 
a she had almost said a strange 
a i am quite of your opinion sir a replied mrs allies 
a and so i told miss norland when she bought it a but then you know madam muslin always turn 
to some account or other 
miss morton will get enough out of it for handkerchief or a on or a cloak 
muslin can never be said to be wasted 
have heard my sister say to forty times when the has been extravagant in buying more than the wanted or careless in cutting it to pieces 
a both in a charming place sir 
there are so many good shops here 
we are sadly off in the country not but what we have very good shops in salisbury but it is so far to go 
eight miles is a long way 
mr allies say it is nine measured nine 
but i am sure it can not be more than eight 
and it is such i flag 
i come back tired to death 
now here one can step out of doors and get a thing in ve minutes mr time was polite enough to seem interested in what the said 
and she kept him on the subject of calling till the dancing recommenced 
catherine feared at she listened to their discourse that he indulged himself a little too much with the foibles of others 
a what are you thinking of to earnestly 
a said he as they walked back to the ball-room 
a not of your partner i hope for by that shake of the head your meditations are not satisfactory catherine coloured and said a i was not thinking of anything a that ll artful and deep to be cure 
but i had rather be told at once that you will not tell me 18 northanger abbey 
a well then i will not a thank you 
for now we shall soon be acquainted as i am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much they danced again 
and when the assembly closed parted on the lady side at lent with a strong inclination for continuing the acquaintance 
whether she thought of him so much while she drank her warm wine and water and prepared herself for bed as to dream of him when there can not be ascertained but i hope it was no more than in a slight slumber or a morning doze at most 
for if it be true as a celebrated writer has maintained that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentleman's love is declared a it must he very in hopes that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before the gentleman s first known to have dreamt of her 
how proper mr time might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered mr assents head but that he was not objectionable as a common acquaintance for his young charge he was on inquiry misled 
for he had early in the evening taken pains to know who her paper was and had been assured of mr tilney’s being a clergyman and of a very respectable family in gloucestenhire 
chuse 37

19 time did not appear 
even creature in bath exeepthimselﬂwu to be seenuiii the room it different periods of the fashionable hour 
crowds of people were every moment passing in and out up the steps and down 3 people when nobody cared about and nobody wanted to see 
and he only was absent 
what a delightful place bath is a said mrs allies a they eat down near the great clock after parading the room till they were tired 
and how pleasant it would be if we had any acquaintance here this sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that mrs allies had no clara reason to hope it would be followed with more advantage now 
but we are told to 
despair of nothing we would stain 1 at unwearied diligence our point would gain a and the unwearied diligence with which she had every day wished for the one thing was at length to have m june reward 
for hardly had she been seated ten minutes before a lady of about her own age who was sitting by her and had been looking at her attentively for several minutes 
addressed her with great complaisance in these words 
a i think madam i can not be mistaken 
it is a long time since i had the pleasure of seeing you but not your name fallen in this question answered as it reading was the danger pronounced hers to be there 
and mrs allies immediately recognized the features of a formerschonlfellow and intimate whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages and that many years ago 
their joy on this meeting was very great as well it might since they had been contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years 
compliments on good looks now passed 
and after observing how time had slipped away since they were last together how little they had thought of meeting in bath and what pleasure it was to see an old friend they proceeded to make enquiries and give into northanger abbey 
intelligence as to their families sisters and cousins talking both together far more ready to give than to receive information and each hearing very little what the other said 
mrs hope however had one great advantage as a talker over mrs fallen in 3 family of children 
and when she expatiated on the talents of her sons and the beauty of her daughters when she related their different situations and views that john was at oxford edward at merchant taylor and william at sea and all of them more beloved and respected in their different stations than any other three beings ever were mrs allies had no similar information to give no similar triumph to press on the unwilling and believing ear of her friend 
and was forcedtositnndappeartolistentoall these maternal effusions consoling herself however with the discovery which her keen eyes soon made that the lace on mrs hopes was not half so handsome as that on her own a here come my dear girls cried mrs sharpe pointing at three mean-looking females who arm in arm were then moving towards her 
a my dear mrs alland i long to introduce them 
the will be so delighted to see you the fullest is she my eldest 
is not she a fine young woman 
the others are v much admired too but i believe isabella is the handsomest 
the miss horses were introduced 
and miss world who had been for a short time forgotten was introduced likewise 
the name seemed to strike them all 
and after speaking to her with great civility the eldest young lady observed aloud to the rest a how excessively like her brother miss morton is 
6 the very picture of him indeed 
a cried the mother 
and a should have known her any where for his sister 
a was repeated by them all two or three times over 
for a moment catherine was surprized 
northanger abbey 
i l but mr sharpe and her daughters had scarcely begun the history of their acquaintance with mr james norland before she remembered that her eldest brother had lately formed an intimacy with a young man of his own college of the name of hope and that he had spent the last week of the christmas vacation with his family near london 
the whole being explained many obliging things were said by the miss hopes of their wish of being better acquainted with her 
of being considered as already friends through the friendship of their brothers c. which catherine heard with pleasure and answered with all the pretty ox sessions she could command 
and as the first proof of amity she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest miss sharpe and take a turn with her about the room 
catherine was delighted with this extension of her bath acquaintance and almost forgot mr tiled while she talked to miss sharpe 
friendship is certainly the rest balm for the pangs of disappointed love 
their conversation turned upon those subjects of which the free discussion has generally much to do in perfecting a sudden intimacy between two young ladies 
such as dress balls ﬂirtatious and size 
miss hope however being four years of sir than miss morton and at least four years better informed had a very decided advantage in discussing such points 
she could compare the balls of bath with those of tunbridge 
in fashions with the fashions of london 
could justify the opinions of her new friend in many articles of grateful attire 
could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who only smiled on each other 
and point out a quiz through the richness of a crowd 
these powers received due admiration from catherine to whom they were entirely new 
and the respeetwhich they naturally inspired might have been too great for 2 2 nor anger abbey 
familiarity had not the easy gaiety of miss thorns manners and her frequent expressions of delight on this acquaintance with her softened down every feeling of awe and left nothing but tender affection 
their increasing attachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump-room but required when they all quitted it together that miss there should accompany miss morton to the very door of mr allenham house 
and that they should there part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands after learning to their mutual relief that they should see each other across the theatre at night and say their prayers in the same chapel the next morning catherine then ran directly up stairs and watched miss hopes progress down the street from the drawing-room window 
admired the graceful spirit of her walk the fashionable air of her figure and dress and felt grateful as well she might for the chance which had procured her such a friend 
mrs there was a widow and not a very rich one 
she was a good-humoured well-meaning woman and a very indulgent mother 
her eldest daughter had great personal beauty and the younger ones by pretending to be as handsome as their sister imitations her air and dressing in the same style did very well 
this brief account of the family is intended to supposed the necessity of a long and minute detail from mrs sharpe herself of her past advantages and sufferings which might otherwise be expected to occupy the three or four following chapters in which the worthlessness of lords and stories might be set forth 
and conversations which had passed twenty years before he minutely repeated 
northanger abbey 
23 than he 
catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening in resuming the nods and smiles of miss hope though they certainly claimed much of her leisure as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for mr time in every box which her eye could reach 
but she looked in vain 
mr time was no fonder of the play than the pump-room 
she hoped to be more fortunate the next day 
and when her wishes for one weather were answered by acting a beautiful morning she hardly felt a doubt of it 
for a fine sunday in bath emptiness every house of its inhabitants and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is 
as soon as divine service was over the hopes and adieus eagerly joined each other 
and after staying long enough in the pump-room to discover that the crowd was insupportable and that there was not a genteel face to be seen which everybody discoveries every sunday throughout the season they hastened away to the respect to breathe the fresh air of better company 
here catherine and isabella arm in arm again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved enumeration 
they talked much and with much enjoyment 
but again was catherine disappointed in her hope of seeing her partner 
he was no where to be met with 
every search for him was equally successful in morning lounges or evening assemblies hither at the upper nor lower rooms at dressed or lllltll'eseed balls was he perceptible 
nor among the walked the horse or the curricle-driven of the morning 
his name was not in the pump-room book and curiosity could do no more 
he must be gone 24 northanger abbey 
from bath 
yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be so short 
this sort of seriousness which is always so becoming in a hero threw a fresh grace in catherine imagination around his person and manners and increased her anxiety to know more of him 
from the hopes she could learn nothing for they had been only two days in bath before they met with mrs allies 
it was a subject however in which she often indulged with her fair friend from whom she received every possible encouragement to continue to think of him 
and his impression on her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken 
isabella was very sure that he must be a charming young man 
and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with her dear catherine and would therefore shortly return 
she liked him the better for being a clergyman for she must confess herself very to the profession 
and something like a sigh escaped her as she said it 
perhaps catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion but she was not experienced enough in the vessel of love or the duties of friendship to know when delicate raillery was properly called for or when a confidence should be forced 
mrs allies was now quite happy quite satisfied with bath 
she had found some acquaintance 
had been so lucky too as to end in them the family of a most worthy old friend 
and as the completion of good fortune had found these friends by no means so expensive dressed as herself 
her daily expressions were no longer i wish we had some acquaintance in bath 
a they were changed into a how glad i am we have met with mrs sharpe 
a and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families as her young charge and isabella themselves could be 
never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of man there in what they called northanger abbey 
25 reputation 
but in which then wan scarcely ever any exchange of opinion and not often any resemblance of mr. t at mrs there used chiefly of her children an man allies of her gowns 
the progress of the friendship between catherine and lakes was quick as its beginning had been warm 
and they paused so rapidly through every gradation of looking tenderness that there shortly no fresh roof i it to be given to their friends or themselves 
ll'heytmlled each other their christiannarne were always arm-in-arm when they walked pinned us each other train for the dance and were not to be avoided the net 
and if a fairy morning deprived them of other enjoyments they were mild 
resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and dirt and to themselves up to read novels together 
yes novels 
for i will not adopt that ingenious and impolitic custom so common with novel writer of degrading by their contemptuous heir the very performance to the number of which they are themselves adding joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the hardest epithet on loth works and scarcely ever admitting them to be lead by their own heroine who if she accidentally take up a novel i 
sure to turn over its insipid page with all if the heroine of one novel be not patronised by the heroine of mother from whom can flirt expect protection and regard 
i not approve of it let us leave it to the reviews to abate such tllilsinrna of fancy at their leisure and over every new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the purest 
now grooms 
let no not desert one another 
we are an injured body 
although our production love afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any other literary consolation in the world no species of composition has been so much deceived 
from pride ignorance or fashion our fogs are most c 26 northanger abbey 
as many as our readers 
and while the civilities of the nine-hundredth ridge of the history of england or of the man who collects and publishing in a volume some dozen lines of milsom pope and prior with a paper from the spectator and a chapter from stern are apologized by a thousand pens there seems almost a general wish of denying the ca city and undervaluing the labour of the novelty and orslighu'ng the performances which have only genius wit and taste to recommend them 
a i am no novel reader 
i seldom look into novels 
do not imagine that i often read novels 
it is really very well for a novelty such is the common cant 
a and what are you reading miss 
— 1 oh 
it is only a novel 
a replies the young lady 
while she lays down her book with affected and sense or momentary shame 
a it is only peculiar or call or behind 
or in short only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature the happiest destination of its varieties the liveliest effusions wit and humour are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language 
now had the some young lady been engaged with a volume of the spectator inmate of such a work how proudly would she have produced the book and told its name 
though the chance must be against her being occupied any part of that villainous publication of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person taste 
the substance of papers so often consisting in the statement of improbable circumstances unnatural character and topics of conversation which no longer concern any one living 
and their language too frequently so coarse a to give no very favourable idea of the age that could endure it

but catherine heard neither the nor the result 
her companions dieoonne now sunk from it hitherto animated to nothing more than a short decided sentence of praise or condemnation on the face of every woman they met 
and catherine after listening and agreeing on long an the could with all the civility and deference of the youthful female mind fearful of hearing an opinion of its own in opposition to that of a uelf-auured man especially where the beauty of her own sex ll concerned ventured at length to vary the subject by a question which had been long uppermost in her thoughts it wan 
have you ever read a droll he a mr sharpe pay a -5 doth 
a oh lord not i 
i never read novels 
i have something else to do

there has not been a tolerably decent one come out in tom jones 1 except the ‘monlu’ i read that other day 
hate for all die there they are the stupidest thing in creation 
38 common sum 
a i think you must like a udolpho 1 if you were to read it 
it is so very interesting not i wish 
no if i read any it shall be mrs radcliife’s 
her novels are amusing enough 
they are worth reading 
some fun and nature in that 7 a udolpho wan written by mrs radcliffe 1 said catherine with some hesitation from the fear of mortifying him 
so sure 
wait 
aye i remember to it was 
i was thinking of that other stupid book written by that woman they make such fuss about 
she who married the french emigrant 1 i suppose you mean calls eyes that’sthe book 
such unnatural 15 
an old man playing at lee-saw 
i took up the an volume once and looked it over but i soon found it would not do 
indeed i guessed what sort of stuff it must be before i saw it as soon as i heard she had fancied an emigrant i was sure i should never be able to get through it a i have never read it a you had no loss i assure you 
it it the horrible nonsense you can imagine 
thereisnothing in the world in it but an old man's playing at needs and leaning satin 
upon my soul there is not this critique the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor catherine brought them to the door of mrs hopes lodgings and the feelings of the discerning and an prejudiced reader of familiar gave way to the feelings of the duties and affectionate son no they met mrs those who had descried them from above in the passage 
a ah mother how do you do 2 1 said he giving her a hearty shake of the hand a where did you get that quiz of a hat it makes you look like an old watch 
here is norland and i come to my a few days with you 
to you must look out for a couple of northangbr abbey 
39 good beds some where nearer and this darkness seemed to satisfy all the fondest wishes of the mother's heart for she received him with the most delighted and exulting affection 
on his two younger sister he then bestowed an equal portion of his fraternal tenderness for he asked each of them how they did and observed that they both looked very ugly 
these manner 
did not please catherine 
but he was james friend and isabella s brother 
and her jluigrneut was further bought of by isabella's assuring her when they withdrew to see the new hat that john thought her the most charming girl in the world and by john engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening 
had she been older or gainer arch attacks might have done little 
but where youth and diffidence are united it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to relate attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world and being is very early engaged as a partner 
and the consequence was that when the two norland after sitting an hour with the hopes net noi 
to walk together to mr allies s and lyme as the door was closed on them said a well catherine how do you like my friend there 9 
instead of answering as she probably would have done had there been no friendship and no matter in the case a i do not like him at all 
a she directly replied 1 i like him very much 
he seems very agreeable 4 he is as good-natured a fellow as ever lived 
a little of a rattle 
but that will recommend him to your sex i believe and how do you like the rest of the evil 9 a very very much indeed isabella particularly i am verygladto hear you eyes sheisjustthe kind of young woman i could wish to see you attached to

in praise of miss hope till they reached pulteney street where he was welcomed with great kindness by mr and mr allies invited by the former to dine with them and summoned by the latter to guess price and weigh the merit of a new muff and tippet

a i assure you a said the 1 i would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world 3 for if 
did we should certainly be ill-fated the whole evening catherine accepted thin kindness with gratitude and they contained no they were for three minutes longer when isabella who had been talking to jane 
on the other tide of her turned again to hit litter and whisper a my dear creature i am afraid i most leave you your brother ii to amazingly impatient to begin 
i know you will not mind my going away and i dare lay john will be back in a moment and then you may easily lend me out catherine though a little disappointed had too much good nature to make any opposition and the others rising up lately had only time to prefer friend's hand an 
say a hue in dear love before hurried on 
the can 1 this being lllgdancing catherine what leg to the meat my horse and mrs allies between whom she now remained 
she could not help being vexed at the son c of mr there s the not only longed to he dancing but was likewise aware that an the rule dignity of her situation could not be known the was sharing with the score of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner 
to be disgrace in the eye of the world to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart in all a her union 
all innocence and the misconduct of another the true source of her debasement in one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the eminent liquor her fortitude under it what particularly dignities her character 
catherine had fortitude too 
the widow murmur planned her lips 
norland or abbey 
43 from this name of humiliation the win roused at the end of an minutes to a pleasanter feeling by seeing 
not mr hope but mr tiled within three yards of the place where they not he seemed to be moving that way but he did not lee her and therefore the smile and the blush which hit sudden appearance raised in catherine passed away without supplying her heroism importance 
he looked as handsome and a lively at ever and wan talking with interest to a fashionable and plain-looking young woman who leant on his arm and whom catherine immediately guessed to be his litter 
thus unthinking throwing away a fair opportunity of considering him lost to her for ever by being married already 
but guided only by what was aim lee and probable it had never entered her head that sir time could be married 
he had not behaved he had not talked like the married men to whom he had been need 
he had never mentioned a wife and he had acknowledged a sister 
from there circumstance spend the instinct conclusion of hit liquor now being by his ride 
and therefore instead of turning of a death-like planets and falling in a lit on mr allenham bosom catherine that perfect in the perfect one of her senses and with cheeks only a little redden than usual 
mr finery and his companion who continued though slowly to approach were immediately preceded by a lady an acquaintance of man there 
and thin lady are in to speak to her they an belonging to her hoped kettle and catherine catching mr tilney’e eye instantly received from him the admiring tribute of nation 
she returned it with pleasure and then advancing still nearer he spoke both in her and mr allies by whom he war very civilly acknowledged 
“iarnveryhap ytoaeeyoua sir indeed

very morning after his having had the pleasure of seeing her 
a well air and i dare nay you are not sorry to be back again for it is just the place for young pop leg 
and indeed for everybody else too 
i tell mr a en when he talk of being sick of it that i am sure he should not complain for it ll go very agreeable a place that it in much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year 
i tell him he in quite in luck to be sent here for his health 
a and i hope madam that mr allies will be obliged to like the place from sending it of service to him 
a think on air 
i have no doubt that he will 
a neighbour of ours dr dinner was here for bit health last winter and came away quite tout 1 that circumstance must give great encouragement a year air 
and dr skins and his family were here threemonths 
so i tell mr allies hemmwbein a hue to get away 
ere they were interrupted by a request from mrs hope to are allies that the would move a little to accommodate man hug and men tinged with seats at they had agreed to join their party 
this was accordingly done mr tiled still continuing standing before them 
and after a few minutes consideration he asked catherine to dance with him 
this compliment delightful as it was produced severe mortification to the lady 
and in giving her denial the expressed her sorrow on the occasion to very much at if she really felt it that had those who joined her just afterwards been half a minute earlier he might have thought her suffering 
rather too acute 
the very easy manner in which he then told her that he had kept her waiting did not by any meant reconcile her more to her lot 
nor did the particulars which he entered into while they northanger abbey 
45 were standing up of the horses and door the friend whom he had just left and of i proposed exchange of ferrars between them interest her in much an to prevent her looking ve often towards that part of thereon where she had left mr tiled 
of her dear isabella in whom she particularly longed to point out that gentleman she so d lee nothing 
they were in different sea 
she was parted from all her party and away from all her acquaintance 
one mortification succeeded another and from the whole the deduced this useful lesson that to go previously engaged to a hall does not necessary increase either the dignity or enjoyment of a young lady 
from such a moralizmgstrain a thin the w suddenly roused by a touch on the shoulder 
and turning round reserved on hughes directly behind her mended miss finery and a tendency 
i beg your pardon a world a aid she for thin liberty but i can not anyhow get to mind there 
and my mind she was cure you would not have the lean objection to letting in this young lady by your mrs hughes could not have a lie to any creature in the room more happy to oblige her than catherine 
the young ladies were introduced to each other mine tiled expressing a proper genius such goodness 
mist norland 
with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of the obligation 
and mr hughes 
fatigued with having so respected settled her young charge returned to her party 
miss tilneyhad a goodﬁgure aprettyface and very i e countenance 
and her air though it had not the decided pretension the resolute juli-hoe“ of mill thorpe’l had more real elegance 
her manner shewed good fence and good breeding 
they were neither thy nor affectedly open 
and she learned capable of being young attractive and at a bell without wanting to fix the mention of every man near her and 46 vdrthanger abbey 
without exaggeration feelings of ecstatic delight or in 
conceive vexation on e little trifling occurrence 
catherine interested at once my her appearance and her relationship to mr time was desirous of being acquainted with her and readily talked therefore whenever she could think of anything to say and had courage and leisure for saying it 
but the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy by the frequent want of one or more of these requisite prevented their doing more than going through the first judgments of an acquaintance by informing themselves how well the other liked bath how much she admired its building and surrounding caitlin-z 
whether she drew or played or sang and whether e was fond of riding on horseback 
the two dances were scarcely concluded before catherine found her arm gently seized by her faithful isabella who in great spirits exclaimed at last i have got you 
my dearest creature i have been looking for you this hour 
what could induce you to come into this set when you knew i was in the other 
i have been quite wretched without you 
my dear isabella how was it possible for me to get at you 
i could not even see where you were a so i told your brother all the time but he would not believe me 
do go and seek for her mr norland said i 
but all in vain he would not stir an inch 
was not it so mr norland 
but you men are all so immoderately lazy 
i have been scolding him to such a degree my dear catherine you would be quite amazed 
you know i never stand upon ceremony with such people look it that young lady with the white bends round her head a whispered catherine detaching her friend from james 1 it is mr tiled s sister 
oh heavens 
you don't say so 
let me look at northanger essay 
41 her this moment 
what a delay full girl 
i never saw anything half so beautiful 
at where is her conquering brother 
is he in the room 
point him ontmmedﬁsinstangifheisgldiemseehim 
mr norland 
you are not to listen 
we are not talking about you but what is all this whispering about 
wants gain on 
7 a here now i knew how it would be 
you men have such restless curiosity 
talk of the cnrioaityof men indeed 
is nothing 
but be satisfied 
for you are not to know anything at all of the matter 
and is that like to satisfy me do you think 
a well i declare l never knew anything like you 
what can it signify to you what we are talking of -5 perhaps we are king about you 
therefore i would advise you not to listen or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable in this commonplace chatter which lasted some time the original subject seemed entirely forgotten 
and though catherine was very well pleased to have it dropped for a while she could not avoid a little suspicion at the total suspension of all isabella's impatient desire to see mr t nay 
when the orchestra struck up a fresh dance james would have led his fair partner away but she resisted 
i tell you mr world a she cried i would not do such a thing for all the world 
how can you he so teasing 
only conceive m dear catherine what your brother wants me to do 
his want me to dance with him again though i tell him that it is a most improper thing and entirely against the rules 
it would make us theralkoftheplaceﬁl’ we were not to change ears 
up my honour 1 said james in these public assert is it is as often done as not 
nonsense how can you say so 
but when you 48 northanger abbey 
men have a point to you never sick at anything 
my sweet catherine s in rut me 
persuade your brother how impossible it in 
tell him that it would quite you to see me do such thing 
would not it 
a no not all 
boil you think wrong youhad much better change there a cried isabella a you hear what your crime away and yet you will not mind her 
well remember that it in not to fault if we recall the old ladies bath in a bustle 
time along my dearest catherine for heaven sake and stand b meal and of they went to regain their former place 
on those in the meanwhile had walked away 
and catherine ever willing to give mr time an opportunity of thing the agreeable request which had already lasted her once made her way to mr fallen and mrs to a fasten should in the hope of finding him sail with them a hope which when it proved to be fruitless she felt to have been highly unreasonable 
a well my dear 1 aid man there impatient for prize of her own i hope you have had in agreeable partner a very agreeable madam

and after a short silence she added he is a very agreeable young man a indeed he is an allies 1 said on shore smiling complacently 
a i must say it though i as his mother that there not a more agreeable young so in the world 
this inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many 
but it did not puzzle man allies 
for after only a moment's consideration the said in a whisper to catherine 1 i dare say she thought i was speaking of her son 
catherine was disappointed and vexed 
she seemed to have missed by so little the very object she had had in view 
and this persuasion did not incline her to a very gracious reply when john who came up to her soon afterwards and mind dwell world i neroge’yonandiare to stand up and join it together i i 
oh no i i am much obliged you our two dances moves

come along with me and i will show you the our greatest quizzing in the room 
my two younger sisters and their partners 
i have been laughing at them this half hour again catherine excused herself 
and at last he walked off to quiz his sisters by himself 
the rest of the evening she found very dull 
mr time was drawn away from their party at tea to mend that of his partner 
miss time though belonging to it did not sit near her i and james and isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the latter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one until one square and one 
dearest catherine 
50 northern goers abbey 
banter a 
he progress of catherine unhappiness from the events of the evening was as follows 
it up peeped trust in a general dissatisfaction with everybody about her while she remained in the rooms which my brought on considerable various and a violent desire to go home 
this on arriving in pulteney street took the direction of extraordinary hungry and when that was a changed into an earnest longing to he in bed 
such was the extreme 
not of her distress for when there she immediately into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours and from which she awoke perfectly revived in excellent spirits with fresh hopes and fresh schemes 
the first wish of her heart was to improve her no acquaintance with miss finery and almost her first resolve upon to seek her for that purpose in the pump-mom at noon 
in the pump-room one so newly arrived in bath must be met with 
and that building the had already found so favourable for the discovery of female excellence and the completion of female intimacy so admirably adapted for secret discourses and animated conscience that she was most reasonably encouraged to expect another friend from within its walls 
her plan for the morning thus settled she sat quietly down to her book for breakfast resolving to remain in the same place and the same employment will the clock struck one 
and from habit very little incommoded by the remarks and ejaculations of mrs allies whose fancy of mind and rapacity for thinking were such 
that as she never talked a great deal so she could never be entirely silent 
and therefore while she sat at her work if she lost her needle or broke her thread if she heard a carriage in themegorsawaspeckuponhergown schemes northanger abbey 
sir observe it aloud whether there were any one at leisure to answer her or not 
at about half-past twelve a remarkably loud rap drew her in hate to the window and scarcely had she time to inform catherine of there being two open carriages at the door in the first only a servant her brother driving miss hope in the second 
before john there came running up stairs calling out a well miss morton here i am 
have you been waiting long 
we could not come before the old devil of a coachmaker was such an enormity finding out a thing it to be got into and now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are out of the street 
how do you do mrs allies 9 a famous hall last night 
was not it 
come miss morton require for the others are in a confounded hurry to be all they want to get their table over 
a what do you mean 
said catherine 
where are you all going to it 
going to 
why you have not forgot our en 
engagement 
did not we agree together to take a drive this morning 
what a head you have 
we are going up clayton down 
a something was said about it 
i remain a said catherine looking at mrs allies for her opinion 
but really i did not expect you 
a not expect reel that's a good one 
and what a dust you would have made if i had not come 
a catherine silent appeal to her friend meanwhile wan entirely thrown away 
for mrs allies not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression herself by a such was not aware of its being ever intended any body clue 
and catherine whose desire of seeing miss tiled again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive and who thought there could be no impropriety in her going with mr hope as isabella 5 2 northanger abbey 
was going it the some time with james was therefore obliged to speak plainer 
a well means what do you any to it 
can you spared me for an hour or two 
shall i go p. do set i. learnt in dear a bed on allied with the mislaid irrydiff'erencenpilatherine took the advice and run of to get ready 
in a very few minutes the reappeared having career allowed the two other time enough to get through a few short sentences in her praise after there had procured me assents admiration of hit gig and then receiving her friends parting good wishes they both hurried down stairs 
m dearer cure a cried unwell to whom the duty of headship immediately called her before the could get into the carriage you have been at lean three hours getting ready i was afraid you were ill 
what a delightful ball we had last night 
i have a thousand thing to lay to you

i quite doat on her a you will not be frightened mine world a aid there an he handed her in life my horse should dance about a little at an netting off he will most likely give a plunge or two and earth take the rest for a minute 
but he will noon know his master 
he is full of spirits play at can be but there in no vice in him catherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one but it wan too late to retreat and the way too young to own herself frightened 
so resigning herself to her fate and trusting to the animal boasted knowledge of its owner the at palpably down and as there lit 
down by her 
everything being then arnorthanger abbey 
33 urged theuemntwho mode at the hone’eheldwu bid in an important voice to let him go and of they went in the quietest manner imaginable without a plunge or a paper or anything like one 
catherine delighted at to happy an escape spoke her pleasure aloud with grateful surprize 
and her companion immediately made the matter perfectly aim e by naming her that it was entirely owing to the peace early judicious manner in which he had then held the nine and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he had directed his whip 
catherine though the could not help wondering that with such perfect command of his 
home he should think it necessary to alarm her with a relation of its tricks congratulated herself interest on being under the care of so excellent a coachman 
and perceiving that the animal continued to go on in the lame quiet manner without throwing the smallest probity towards any unpleasant vivacity and considering in inevitable ca wm ten mile an hour by no means alarmingly lit gave herself up to all the enjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorating kind in a one mild dab of february with the consciousness of safety 
a ii essence of several minutes succeeded their kent than dialogue 
it was broken by 1 saying very shrug they a old fallen in as rich up a w in not he 
a there did not understand him and he repeated his question adding in explanation 1 old allies the man you are with oh

7 a lord help you 
you women are days thinking of means being in liquor 
why you do not suppose a man it event by a bottle 
i am sure of fix that if everybody was to drink their bottle today 
there would not be half the disorder in the world there are now 
it would be a famous good thing for us all a i can not believe it a oh lord

you would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four points at the utmost

it we looked upon at something out of the common way 
mine is famous study to be sure 
you would not often meet with anything like it in oxford and that may account for it but this will just

5 5 this declaration brought on a loud and powdering reply of which no pump am very distinct 
except the frequent exclamation amounting almost to both which adorned it and catherine was left what it ended with rather i strengthened belief of there being a great deal of wine drunk in oxford and the same happy conviction of her bmther’r comparative sobriety

you do not really think mr hug aid catherine venturing after worse time to contain 11 the matter an entirely decided and to offer sombre little variation on the subjects that janet'gig will break down

oh lord what is there in that

the carriage is safe enough if a man knows how to drive it 
a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty years after it is early worn our 
lord bless on 
i would undertake for five pounds to drive it to park and back again without losing a nail 
catherine listened with astonishment 
she knew not how to reconcile two such very different accounts of the same thing 
for she had not been brought up to understand the propensities of a rattle nor to know to how man i e assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity will lead 
her own family were plain matter-of-fact people who seldom aimed at wit of any kind 
her father at the utmost being contented with a pun and her mother with a proverb 
they were not in the habit therefore of telling lies to increase their importance or of asserting at one moment what they would contradict the next 
she reflected on the affair for some time in much perplexity and was more than once on the point of requesting from mr horse a clearer insight into his real opinion on the subject 
but she checked herself because it appeared to her that he did not excel in giving those clearer insight in making those things plain which he had before made am out and joining to this the consideration that he would not really supper his sister and his friend to be exposed to a danger from which he might easily perceive them she concluded at last that he must know the carriage to be in fact perfectly safe and therefore would alarm herself northanger abbey 
s 7 no longer 
by him the whole matter seemed entirely forgotten 
and all the most of hicouvemtion or rather talk began and ended with himself and hit own concerns 
he told her of horses which he had bought for a ride and sold for incredible sums 
of raising matched in which his judgment had infallibly foretold the winter 
of cheating parties in which he had killed more birds though without having one good hot than all hit companion together 
and described to her come famous day's sport with the fox 
wounds in which his bright and still in directing the doge had the mistakes of the most experienced huntlrnan 
and in which the coldness of his riding though it had never endangered his own life for a moment had been constantly leading others into difficulties which he calmly concluded had broken the eclat of many 
little a catherine was in the habit of judging for herself and vexed as were her general notion 
of what men ought to be she could not entirely repress a doubt while the bore with the eﬂ'uaione of hit endless conceit of his being altogether completely agreeable 
it was a bold air-mite for he was inabelh’e brother and the had been married by james that his manner would recommend him to all her sex 
but in spite of thin the extreme easiness of his company which crept over her before dignity had been out joy 
hour and which continued unceasing to increase 6 the in pug renew street again induced her in not mean to resist such high authority and to distrusts his power of giving universal pleasure 
when the arrived at my allies s door the astonishment on isabella was hardly to be expand on finding that itbut late in thedayforthemtn and her friend into the rule 
— put three o'clock 
a it was inconceivable incredible impossible and she would neither believe her own watch nor her e 38 northanger abbey 
brother nor the servants she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality till norland produced his watch and ascertained the fact to have doubted a moment longer 200 would have been equally inconceivable incredible and impossible and she could only softest over and over again that no two hours and a hall had ever gone of so swiftly before as catherine was called on to confirm 
catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please isabella 
but the latter was spared the misery of her friend s dissentient voice by not waiting for her answer 
her own feelings entirely engrossed her 
her wretchedness was most acute on finding herself obliged to go directly home 
it was ages since she had had a moment's conversation with her dearest catherine and though she had such thousands of things to say to her it appeared as if they were never to be together again 
so with smiles of most exquisite misery and the laughing eye of utter despondency she bade her friend adieu and went on 
catherine found mrs allies returned from all the busy idleness of the morning and was immediately greeted with a well my dear here you are 
7 a truth which she had no greater inclination than power to dispute 
and i hope you have had a pleasant airing 
7 a yes ma'am i thank you 
we could not have had a nicer days so mrs hope said 
she was vastly pleased at your all going a you have seen mrs sharpe then put 7 a yes 
i went to the pump-room as soon as you were gone and there i met her and we had a great deal of talk together 
she says there was hardly any veal to he got at makes this morning it is so uncommonly scarce 
a did you see any body else of our acquaintance 
northanger abbey 
39 eyes 
we agreed to take a turn in the crescent and there we met mrs hughes and mr and miss title walking with her 
a it out indeed 
and did they to 9 “yenywe walked along the great together for half an hour 
they seem very agreeable people 
miss time was in a very pretty spotted muslin and i fancy by what i can learn that she always dresses very handsomely 
mrs hughes talked to me a great deal about the family and what did she tell you of them 9 
oh 
a vast deal indeed 
the hardly talked of anything else 
a did she tell you what part of gloucestershire they come from 9 
yes she did but i can not recollect now 
but they are very good kind of people and very rich 
mrs 1 hey was a miss summoned and she and mrs hughes were school-fellow 
and miss dnmunond had a very large fortune and when she married her father gave her twenty thousand pounds and have hundred to buy wedding clothes 
mrs hughes saw all the clothes after they came from the warehouse 
a and are mr and mrs time in bath 
7 a yes i fancy they are but i am not quite certain 
upon recollection however i have a notion they are both dead 
at least the mother is 
yes i am sure my time is dead because mrs hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that mr summoned gave his daughter on her wedding-day and that miss time has got now for they were put by for her when her mother did 
and is mr time my partner the only son 2 
i can not be quite positive about that my dear 
i have some idea he is 
but 
however he is a very one go northanger abbey 
yoriln’g’ man mr hughes eye and likely to do very we 
catherine inquired no further 
she had heard enough to feel that mrs allies had no real intelligence to give and that she was most particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister 
could she have foreseen such a circumstance nothing should have persuaded her to go out with the others 
and as it was she could only lament her ill luck and think over what she had lost till it was clear to her that the drive had no means been very pleasant and that john there himself was quite disagreeable 
cbsottt 1 
he allies hopes and morals all met in the evening at the theatre 
and as catherine and isabella sat together there was then an opportunity for the latter to utter some few of the many thousand things which had been collecting within her for communication in the immeasurable length of time which had divided them 
a oh heavens 
my beloved catherine have i got you at last 
a was her address on catherine entering the box and sitting by her 
know mr world a or he was close to her on the other side i shall not speak another word to you all the rest of the evening 
so i charge you not to expect it my sweetest catherine how have you been this long age 
but i need not ask you for you look delightfully 
you really have done your hair in a more slovenly style than ever 
you mischievous creature do you want to attract everybody 
i suits you my brother is quite in love with you already 
and as for mr tiled 
but that is settled thing 
even jamnorthanger am 
or modesty can not doubt his attachment now 
his coming back to bath makes it too plain 
oh

i really quite wild with impatience 
my mother says he is the most delightful young man in the world 
she saw him this morning you know

how do you like my gown 
i think it does not look in 
the steeles were entirely my own thought 
do you know i. get so immoderately sick of both 
your brother and i were agreeing this morning that though it it vastly well to be here for a few weeks we would not live here for million 
we must found out that our tame were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place 
really our opinions were so exactly the some it war quite ridiculous 
there was not a single point in which we differed 
i would not have had you by for the world 
you are such i sly thing i am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it a no indeed i should not a oh yes 
you would indeed 
i know you better than you know yourself 
you would have told us that we learned born for each other or some nonsense of that kind which would have distressed me beyond conception 
my cheeks would have been a red as your arm 3 i would not have had you by for the world a indeed you do me injustice 
i would not have made to improper a remark upon any account 
and besides i am sure it would seem have entered my head isabella smiled incredulous and talked the rent of the evening to james 
by noithanger abbey 
i catherine s resolution of endeavouring to meet miss tiled again continued in full force the next morning 
and till the usual moment of going to the pump-room she felt some alarm from the dread of a second preventing 
but nothing of that kind occurred no visitors appeared to delay them and shall three set of in good time for the pump-room where the credit course of events and conversation took place 
s assent 
after drinking his glass of water joined some gentlemen to talk over the politics of the day and compare the accounts of their newspapers 
and the ladies walked about together noticing every new face and almost ever new bonnet in the room 
the female part of the hope family attended by james norland appeared among the crowd in less than a quarter of an hour and catherine immediately took her usual place by the side of her friend 
james who was now in constant attendance maintained a similar position and separating themselves from the rest of their party they walked in that manner for some time till catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which condemning her entirely to her friend and brother gave 
her very little share in the notice of either 
they were always engaged in some sentimental discussion or lively dispute but their sentiment was conveyed in such ring voices and their vivacity attended with so much laughter that though catherine supporting pin 
in was not unfrequently called for by one or the other she was never able to give any from not having heard a word of the subject 
at length however she was empowered to disengage herself from her friend by the avowed necessity of speaking to miss tiled whom the most joyﬁrllysswjust entering the room with mrs hughes and whom she instantly joined with a former determination to be as untainted 
than she might love had courage to common had she not been urged by the disappointment northanger abbey 
6 of the before 
miss tilneyrnetherwith great civility returned her advance with equal good will and they continued talking together as long as both parties remained in the room 
and though in all probability not an observation was made nor an expression need by either which had other made and need some thousands of time before under that roof in every bath season yet the merit of their being spoken with simplicity and truth and without personal conceit might be something uncommon 
how well your brother dances was an artless exclamation of catherine towards the close of their conversation which ii once surprized and amused her companion 
henry 
6 the replied with a mile 
yes be due dance very well 4 he must have thought it very odd to hear me say i was engaged the other evening when he saw me sitting down 
but i really had been engaged the whole day to mr sharpe 
miss time could only bow 
5 on can not think a added catherine after a moments silence how surprised i was to one him again 
i felt to cure of his being quite gone away 
when henry had the pleasure of seeing you before he wan in bath but for a couple of days 
he came only to engage lodging for us 
a that never occurred to me 
and of course not seeing him anywhere i thought he must be gone 
was not the young lady he danced with on monday 3 miss 
smith 
7 a yes 
an acquaintance of mr hughes 
i dare lay the was very glad to dance 
do you think her pretty i 7 a not very 
he never come to the pump-room i suppose 2 a yet 
sometimes 
but he has rid out thin morning with my father go on e 6 northanger abbey 
man ought now joined them and asked miss tilneyiflhewaereadytogo 
i hopelehallhave the place of seeing you again soon a laid catherine 
shall you he at the million ball to-morrow 3 1 perhaps we 
yes i think we certainly half a i am glad of it or we shall all be there 
civility was duly returned and they parted on miss tilney’a side with some knowledge of her nevucquninunce e feelings and on catherine without the smallest oonecioutneu of having explained them 
she went home very happy 
the morning had answered all her hopes and the evening of the following day was now the object of expectation 
the future good 
what gown and what head-dreehe should weston the occasion became her chief concern 
she can not be united in it 
dress in at all times a drive 
long distinction and expensive solicitude about it often enjoy its own aim 
catherine knew all thin very well 
her great aunt had rather lectures the subject only the christmas before 
and yet she lay awake ten minutes on wednesday night debating between her spotted and her tambour muslin 
and nothing but the ahnrtneu of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening 
thin would have been an error in judgment great though not uncommon from which one of the other year rather than her own a brother rather than i great aunt might have warned her 
for in only can be aware of the insensibility of man towards a new gown 
it would be mortifying to the feelings of many ladies could they be made to understand how little the heart of man ll affected by what is mostly or new in their more 
how little it ll misused by the mixture of their muslin and how unaueeeptihle of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted 
the argued the full or the jnclroner 
woman ll one for her own satisfaction alone 
no man will admire her the more no northanger abbey 
-5 woman will like her the better for it 
neatness and fashion are enough for the former and of something of dnabbinete or impropriety will be most endearing to the later 
but not one of these grave reﬂectiontroubled the tranquillity of catherine 
she entered the rooms on sunday evening with feelingly different from what had attended her thither the monday before 
she had then been exulting in her engagement to hope and was now chiefly anxious to avoid his night 
lest he should engage her again 
for though the could not dared not expect that mr time should all her i third time to dance her wishes hopes and plans all centered in nothing less 
every young lady may feel for my heroine in thin critical moment for every young lady has at some time or other known the name agitation 
all have been or at learn all have believed themselves to be in danger from the pursuit of some one whom they wished to avoid 
and all have been anxious for the attention of some one whom they wished to please 
as soon an they were joined by the the s catherine agony began 
the fidgeted about if on there came toward her hid herself at much as possible from his view and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear him 
the cotillione were over the country-dances beginning and the saw nothing of the tiled 
a do not be frightened my dear catherine a whisper isabella but i am really going to dance with your brother again 
i declare positively it in quite shocking 
i tell him he ought to he ashamed of himself but you and john must keep us in countenance 
make hate my dear creature and come to us 
john in just walked off but he will be back in a moment 
catherine had neither time nor inclination to answer 
the other 
walked away 
john who was mill in view and the gave herself up for in 
she might be northanger abbey 
not appear however to observe or expect him she kept her eyes intently fixed on her fan 
and a self-condemnation for her folly in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet with the times in any reasonable time had just used through her mind when she suddenly found be addressed and again solicited to dance by mr t illness himself 
with what sparkling eyes and ready motion she granted his request and with how pleasing a matter of heart she went with him to the set may be easily imagined 
to escape and as she believed so narrowly escape john sharpe and to be asked so immediate s on his joining her asked by mr silly as if he had sought her on purpose l 
— it did not appear to her that life could supply any greater felicity 
scarcely had they worked themselves into the quiet possession of a place however when her attention was claimed by john those who stood behind her 
heyday miss morton 
a said he what is the meaning of this 
i thought you and i were to dance together 
a 1 wonder you should think so for you never asked me 
“thatissgoodone by jove 
i sskedymassoou as i came into the room and i was just going so ask on again but when i turned round you were gone 
his is a curtsey shabby trick 
i only came or the sake of dancing with you and i firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since monday 
as 
i remember i asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak 
and here have i been telling all my acquaintance that i was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room 
and when they see you standing up with somebody else they will quiz me famous you a oh 
no 
they will never think of use after such s description as that 
rout-tans” 
abbey 
-5 by heavens 
if they do not i will kick theme of the room for blockhead 
what chapel have you there 3 1 catherine actuated his curiosity 
a time 4 he repeated 
hum 
i do not know him 
a good figure of a man 
well put together 
does he want a horse 
here is a friend of mine sam fetches us got one to sell that would suit anybody 
a famous clever animal or the road 
only forty guineas 
i had fifty minds to buy it myself for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when i meet with one 
but it would not answer my purpose it would not do for the old 
i would give any money for a real good hunter 
i have three now the best that ever were held 
i would not take eight hundred guinea for them 
fetch and i mean to get a house in leicestershire against the next season 
it 
is so d 
uncomfortable living at an inn this was the last sentence by which he could weary catherine attention for he was just then born of by the castles pressure of a long string of passing ladies her partner now drew near and said that gentleman would have put me out of patience had he staid with you half minute longer 
he has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me 
we have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening and all our agreeableness belongs taller to each other for that time 
nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one without injuring the rights of the other 
i consider a country-dance as an tumbler of marriage 
civility and complaisance are the principal duties of both 
and those men who do not chuse to dance or marry themselves 
have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours 1 but they are such very different things 
a that you think the can not be compared together 
a to be sure not 
people that marrying neverpart 6 nona-hanger anna 
but must go and keep house together 
people that dance only stand opposite to each other in a long me for half an hour a and such is your decision of matrimony and dancing 
taken in that light certainly their resemblance is not striking 
but i think i could place them in such a view 
you will allow that in both man has the advantage of choice woman only the power of refusal 
that in both it is an engagement between man and woman formed for the advantage of each 
and that when once entered into they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its disposition 
that it is their duty each to endeavour to give no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their new yours or fancying that they should have been better of with any one else 
you will allow this 
a yes to be sure as you rate it all this sounds very well 
but still they are so very different 
i can not look upon them at all in the same light nor think the same duties belong to them 
a in one respect there certainly is a difference 
in marriage the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman 
the woman to make the home agreeable to the man 
he is to pure and she is to smile 
but in dancing their duties are exactly changed 
the agreeableness the compliance are expected from him while she finished the an and the lavender water 
that i suppose was the difference of duties which struck on as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison 
a no indeed i never thought of that when i am quite at i loss 
one thing however i must observe 
this disposition on your side is rather alarming 
you totally swallow any similarity in the obligations 
and may i not thence infer that your northangbr abbey 
6 notions of the duties of the dancing state are not w strict no your partner might wishes have i not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return or if any other gentleman were to address you there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose 2 
a mr hope in such a very particular friend of my brother that if he talk to me i must talk to him again 
but there are hardly three young men in the room hedges him that i have any acquaintance wait a hand it that to being only security 
also 
alas 
nay i urn sure that you can not have a better 
for if i do not know anybody it it impossible for me to talktothem 
and besides i do not want to talk to anybody 
now you have given me a security worth having 
and i shall proceed with courage 
do you and bath us agreeable when i had the honour of making the inquiry 
before i 7 a as quite 
more so indeed more to 
take care or on will forget to be tired of it at the proper time 
on ought to be tired at the end of six weeks 1 i do not think i should be tired if i were to my here six months 1 bath compared with london little variety and to everybody and out every year 
for six weeks i allow both is pleasant enough 
but beyond that it in the most tiresome place in the world you would be told so by people of all description who come regularly every winter lengthen their six week into ten or twelve and go away at last beam they can afford to any no longer 
well other people must judge for themselves and those who go to london may think nothing of bath 
but i who live in a small retired village in the country 7 northanger abbey 
can never end greater meanness in such a place as this than in my own home 
for here are a variety ofnmnsememe a variety of things to be seen and done all day long which i can know nothing of there 
you are not fond of the country 
a yes i am 
i have always lived there and always been very happy 
but certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a bath life 
one day in the country is exactly like another 
a but then you spent your time so much more rationally in the country 1 do i put 
do you not a i do not believe there is much difference 
a here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long a and so i am at home only i do not ends much of it 
i walk about here and so i do there 
but here i see a variety of people in every street and there i can on go and call on mrs allies 
a fair time was very much amused 
a only go and call on mrs allies 
4 he repeated 
a what a picture of intellectual poverty 
however when you sink into this abuses again you will have more to say 
you will be able to talk of bath and of all that you did herself 
oh 
as 
i shall never be in want of something to talk 1 again to mrs fallen or anybody else 
i really believe i shall always be talking of bath when i am at home again 
i do like it so very much 
if i could but have papa and mamma and the rest of them here i in dose i should be too ha ye 
james coming my best brother is quite delightful 
and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already 
oh 
who can ever be urged of bath 
7 a not those who bring such fresh feelings of every 9 northanger abbey 
1 
sort to it as you do 
but papa and mamma and brothers and intimate friends are a good deal gone by to most of the frequency of bath 
and the honest relish of balls and plays and everyday sighs is past with them here their conversation closed 
the demands of the dance becoming now too importunate for a divided attention 
soon after their reaching the bottom of the set catherine perceived herself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the 
lookers-on immediately behind her partner 
he was a very handsome man of a commanding aspect past the bloom but not pasture vigour of life 
and with his eye still directed towards her she saw him presently address mr time in a familiar whisper 
confused by his notice and blushing from the fear of its being excited by something wrong in her appearance she turned away her head 
but while she did so the gentleman retreated and her anger coming nearer said i see that you guess what have just been asked 
that gentleman knows your name and you have a right to know his 
his general time my father catherine answer was only 
oh 
a but it was an 
oh it expressing everything needful 
attention to his words and perfect reliance on their truth 
with real interest and strong admiration‘did her eye now follow the general as he moved through the crowd and a how handsome a family they are 
a was her secret remark in chattering with miss time before the evening concluded a new source of felicity arose to her 
she had never taken a country walk since her arrival in bath 
miss time to whom all the commonly requested environs were familiar spoke of them in terms which made her all eagerness to know them too 
and on her 42 northanger abbey 
openly fearing that she might and nobody to go with her it was proposed the brother and sister that they should join in a w key some morning or other 
a i shall like it she cried beyond anything in the world 
and do not let us put it of let us go to-morrow a thin wan readily agreed to with only 10 of miss tilney’t that it did not rain which ca arise wan tune it would not 
at twelve o'clock they were to call for her in pulteney street and a remember twelve o'clock was her parting punch to her new friend 
of her other her older her more established friend isabella of whose delay and worth the had enjoyed a fortnight experience the names law anything during the evening 
yet though longing to make her acquainted with her ha pins the cheerfully submitted to the wish of mr a less which took them rather early away and her spirits danced within her no she danced in her chair all the way home 
a culprit 3 
he now brought a very overlooking morning 
the sun making only a few efforts to appear 
and catherine assured from it everything most favourable to her wishes 
a bright morning so early in the year the allowed would generally turn to rain 3 but a cloud one foretold improvement an the day advanced 
he a lie to mr allies for conversation of her hope but s assent not having his own skin and prompter about him declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine 
she applied to mrs fallen and 41 assent opinion wan more five 
a she had no doubt in the world of its being a very one day if the clouds would only go off and the turn in out at about eleven o'clock however a w speck 
of northanger abbey 
43 mall ruin upon the windows caught catherine watchful eye and a oh dear 
i do believe it will be wet broke from her in a most desponding woe 
a i thought how it would be a laid mrs allies 
a no walk for me to-day 1 sighed catherine 
a but she 
a it may come to nothing or it may hold up or twelve 1 perhaps it may 
but then my dear it will be so dirty 1 33 
that will not signify 
i never mind dirt 
a no a liked her friend v said a i know on never mind-en.” cry pay my yet after a short pause 1 it comes on faster and faster 
said catherine as the mode laughing at a window 
a so it does indeed 
if it keeps ruining the streets will be very weston a there on four umbrellas up already 
how i hate the eight often umbrella 
a they are disagreeable things to carry 
i would much rather take a chair at any time a it was such a nice looking morning 
i felt so convinced it would be dry 
a any body would have thought so indeed 
there will be very few people in the pump-room if it rains all the morning 
i hope mr allies will put on his great coat when he goes but i dare say he will not for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a great coat 
i wonder he should dislike it it must be to comfortable 
the rain continued fast though not heavy 
bath 
arise went every live minute to the clock threatening on each return that if it still kept on remaining another ve minutes the would give up the matter no hopeless 
the clock mock twelve and it will mind a you will not be able to go my dear 
i do not quite despair yet 
i shall not gain it up i 
44 northanger abbey 
till a quarter after twelve 
this in just the time day for it to clear up and i do think it looks a little lighter 
there it it twenty minutes after twelve and now i 1806 give it up entirely 
oh 
that we lad inch weather here as they had at udolpho or at lent in tuesday and the south of f rose the night that poor st subjoin died 
— 
such heantiﬁxl weather 
at half past twelve when catherine anxious attention to the weather was over and she could no longer claim an merit from its amendment the sky began voluntary ay to clear 
a gleam of sunshine took her quite surprized 
he looked round the clouds were parting and she instantly returned to the window to watch over and encourage the happy appearance 
ten 
minutes more made it certain that a his hat afternoon would succeed and justify the opinion of my allies who had always thought it would clear up 
but whether catherine might still expect her friends whether there had not been too much rain for miss time to venture must et be a question 
it was too dirty for us sullen to accompany her husband to the pump-room he accordingly set off by himself and catherine had barely watch him down the meet when her notice was claimed by the approach of the same two open carriages containing the same three pen let that had surprized her to much a few mornings cake 
a isabella my brother and mr hope i declare 
they are coming for me perhaps 
but i shall not go 
i can not go indeed 
for you know miss time may still call mr allies agreed toil john there was noon with them and his voice war with them yet sooner for on the stain he was calling out miss morlnndtohequiok

but however i can not go with you to-day because i am engaged

you are to thank your brother and me or the necklace it darted into our hadnot breakfast time i verily believe it the same intent 
and we should have been off two hour

my beloved creature what do you mean -5 1 i can not go because looking down an she spoke fearful of isabella s smile a i expect miss finery and her brother to call on me to take a country walk 
they promised to come at twelve only it rained 
but now as it is so fine i dare say they will be here soon 
a not they indeed cried sharpe 
a for no we turned into broad street i saw them 
does he not drive a prison with bright chestnuts -5 1 i do not know indeed yes i know he does

and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle took a it is very odd 
but i suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk and well they might for i never saw so much dirt in my life

you could no more walk than you could by 
it has not been to dirty the whole winter 
it in mud deep everywhere isabella corroborated it 
a my dearest catherine you can not form an idea of the dirt 
come you must go 
you can not refuse going now a should like to see the case 
but may we go all over it 
may we go up every source and into every spite of room 2 yes yes 
every hole and corner 
a but then if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is river and call by and by 
7 a make yourself easy there in no danger of that 
noxrnrmcnn essay 
-5 for i heard tiled hallooing to a man who was just gang by on horseback that they were going as far as dick rocks then i will 
shall i go mrs allies 
a just as you please my dear a mrs allies you must persuade her to go was the general cry 
my allies was not inattentive to it 
a well my dear said she a suppose you go 
and in two minutes they were of 
catherine feelings as she got into the carriage were in a very unsettled state divided between regret for the loss of one great pleasure and the hope of soon enjoying another almost its equal in degree however unlike in kind 
she could not drink the illness had acted quite well by her in so readily giving up their engagement without sending her any message of excuse 
it was now but an hour later than the time fixed on for the beginning of their walk 
and in spite of what she had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the course of that hour she could not from her own observation help drinking that they might have gone with verylittle inconvenience 
to feel herself slighted by them was very painful 
on the other hand the delight of exploring any advice like udolpho as her fancy represented b size case to be was such a counterpoise of good as might console her for almost any thing 
they passed briskly down pulteney street and 
through laura place without the exchange of many words 
there talked to his horse and she meditated by turns on broken promises and broken arches phaeton and false hanging s illness and trap-doors 
as they entered argue buildings however she was amused by this address from her companion who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by 2 7 a who 2 where 
a 5 on the right-hand pavement she must be almost 48 news soon 
out of right now catherine looked round and iv in time leaning on her brother am walking slowly down the street 
she saw them both looking back at her 
a stop stop mr sharpe 6 the impatiently cried bit ll mien illness 
it it indeed 
how could you tell me they were gone 
stop 
up i will get out thin moment and go to them 
but to what purpose did the peak 
there only asked his house into a quicker trout 
the times who had soon ceased to look after her were in a moment out of light round the corner of laura place and in another moment the way here whisked into the market place 
still however and during the length of another street the stated him to 
am 1 etc mr those i can not our 
will not go 
ii 
i miss go rckrﬁllﬁu silliest 
g but mr there only laughed racked his whip encouraged his home made odd noise and drove on 
and catherine angry and vexed an the wan having no power of getting away was obliged to give up the point and habit 
her reproach however were not spare 
how could you deceive me so mr sharpe 
how could you i that you saw them driving up the london road i would not have had it happen so for the world 
they must think it to manage no rude of me to go by them too without saying a word 
you do not know how vexed i am 
i shall have no pleasure at clifton nor in anything else 
i had rather ten thousand times rather get out now and walk back to them 
how could you say you saw them driving out in a person 
there defended himself very stoutly declared he had never seen two men so much alike in his life and would hardly give up the point of in having been time himself 
their drive even when this subject was over was not likely to be very agreeable 
catherine complaisance was no longer what it had been in their former northanger abbey 
49 airing 
she listened reluctantly and her replies were short 
blaming castles remained her only comfort 
towards that she still looked at intervals with pleasure 
though rather than be disappointed of the promised walk and especially rather than be thought ill of the times she would willingly have given up i the happiness which its walls could supply the happiness of a progress through a long spite of lady rooms exhibiting the remains of magnificent figure though now for many years deserted the happiness of being stopped in their way along narrow winding vault by a 
low granted door 
or even of having their lamp their only lamp 
extinguished by a sudden gust of wind and of being left in total darkness 
in the meanwhile they proceeded on their journey without any mischance and were within view of the town of keynsharn when a ballroom from norland who was behind them made his friend pull up to know what was the matter 
the others then came close enough for conversation 
and norland said a we had better go back sharpe 
it is too late to go on to-day 
your sister thinks so as well as i 
we have been exactly an hour coming from pulteney street very little more than seven miles 
and i suppose we have at least eight more to go 
it will never do 
we set out s gum deal too late 
we had much better put it or till another day and turn round 
a it is all one to me replied sharpe rather angrily 
and instantly turning his horse they were on their way back to bath 
if your brother had not got such a d 
breast to drive 1 said he soon afterwards 1 we might have done it very well 
my horse would have trusted to clifton within the hour if left to himself and i have aim broke my arm with pulling him in to that curse brokenwinded james pace 
norland is s fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own so northanger abbey 
a no he is not a said catherine warmly 
for 
am sure he could not afford it 
a and why can not be afford it 
7 a because he has not money enough 1 and whose fault is that 
7 a nobody that i know of 
there then said something in the loud incoherently way to which he had often recourse about its being a d 
— 
thing to be misery 
and that if people who enrolled in money could not a odd things he did not know who could which catherine did not even endeavour to understand 
dixon appointed of what was to have been the consolation for her first disappointment she was less and less disposed either to be agreeable herself or to and her companion so 
and they returned to pulteney street without her speaking twenty words 
as she entered the house the 
footman told her that a gentleman and lady had called and inquired for her a few minutes after her setting off 
that when he told them she was gone out with mr hope the lady had asked whether any message had been left for her and on his saying no 
had felt for a card but said she had none about her and went away 
pondering over these heart-reading tidings catherine walked slowly upstairs 
at the head of them she was met by mr allies who on hearing the reason of their speedy return said i am glad your brother had so much sense 
i am glad you are come back 
it was a strange wild scheme they all spent the evening together at hopes 
catherine was disturbed and out of spirits 
but isabella seemed to and a pool of commerce in the fate of which she shared by private partnership with world i very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at clifton 
her satisfaction too in not being at the lower rooms was spoken more than once 
a how northangbr abbey 
8 i pity the poor creatures that are going there 
how glad i am that i am not among them 
i wonder whether it will be a full ball or not 
they have not begun dancing yet 
i would not be there for all the world

i know the mitchell will not be there 
am sure i pity everybody that is 
but i dare say mr world you long to be at it do not you 
i am sure you do 
well pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you 
i dare say we could do very well without you but you men think yourselves of such consequence catherine could almost have accused isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her ioitovii is very little did they appear to dwell on her mind and so very inadequate was the comfort she offered 
a do not he so dull my dearest creature she whispered 
a you will quite break my heart 
it was amazingly shocking to he sure but the ’i‘ilneyu were entirely to blame 
why were not they more punctual 
it was dirty indeed but what did that signify

chapter 33 
a smaller 1 said catherine the next morning 1 will there be any harm in my calling on its tiled to-day 
i shall not be easy 3 i have explained everything a go b all means my dear 
only put on a white gown 
miss toils always wears white catherine cheer lay complied 
and being properly equipped was more in patient than ever to be at the pump-room that she might inform herself of general tilney’s lodgings 
for though she believed they were in milsom street she was not certain of the house and mrs assents wavering convictions only made it more doubtful 
to milsom street she was directed 
and having made herself perfect in the number hastened away with eager steps and a blessing heart to pay her visit explain her conduct and be forgiven dripping lightly through the churchyard and resolutely turning away her eyes that she might not be obliged to see he 
beloved isabella and her dear family who she ha reason to believe were in a shop hard by 
she reached the home without any impediment looked at the number knocked at the door and inquired for miss tiled 
the man believed miss time to be at home but was not quite certain 
would she be pleased to send up her name 
she gave her card 
in a few minutes the servant returned and with a look which did not quite confirm his words said he had been mistaken for that miss time had walked out 
catherine with a blush of mortification left the house 
she felt almost persuaded that miss tiled war at home and too much offended to admit her 
and as she retired down the street could not withhold one glance at the drawing-room windows in expectation of seeing northanger abbey 
8 her there but no one appeared at them 
at the bottom of the interest however she looked back again and then not at a window but issuing from the door she as miss tiled herself 
she was followed by gentleman whom catherine believed to be her father and they turned up towards edward s buildings 
catherine in deep moniﬁcation proceeded on her way 
she could most be angry herself at such angry incivility 
but she checked the resentful sensation she remembered her own innocence 
she knew not how such an offence as hers might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness to what a degree of forgiveness it might with propriety lad nor to what hours of rudeness in return it might justly make her amiable 
dejected and humbled she had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theatre that night 
but it must be confessed that they were not of in continuance 
for she soon collected in the first put acre that she was without any excuse for staying at home 
and in the second that it was a play the wanted very much to see 
to the theatre accordingly they all went 
no illness appeared to plague or please her 
she feared that amongst the many perfections of the family a fondness for plays was not to be ranked but perhaps it was because they were hesitated to the owner rforrnances of the london rage which she knew on isabella's authority rendered everything else of the kind 
quite horrid she was not deceived in her own expectation of pleasure the comedy so well suspended her care that no one observing her during the first four acts would have supposed she had any wretched about her 
on the beginning of the fifth however the sudden view of mr henry finery and his father joining a party in the opposite box recalled her to anxiety and distress 
the stage could no longer excite genuine merriment no longer keep her whole attention 
every other look upon an voyage was 8 common sunny 
directed towards the no positive box 
and for the space of two entire scenes did she thus watch hen time without being once able to catch his eye 
i longer could he he s of indifference for a play 
his notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes 
at length however he did look towards her and he bowed but such a bow 
no smile no continued observance attended it his eyes were immediately returned to their former direction 
catherine was restless miserable 
she could almost have run round to the box in which he sat and forced him to hear her explanation 
feelings rather natural than hers possessed her 
instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation 
instead of ugly resolving in conscious innocence to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation and to enlightened him on the post only by avoiding his sight or flirting with somebody else she took to herself all the shame of misconduct or at least of its appearance and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause 
the play concluded the curtain fell 
henry time was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto eat but his father remained and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box 
she was right in a few minutes he appeared and making his way through the then thinking rows spoke with like calm politeness to mrs fallen and her friend 
not with such calmness was he answered by the latter 
a oh mr finery i have been united wild to speak to you and make my apologies 
or must have thought me so rude 
but indeed it was not my own fault 
was it mrs allies 2 did not they tell me that mr finery and his sister were gone out in s barton together 
and then what could i do 
but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you 
now had not i mrs allies 3 a flat a as i northa‘nger new 
-5 1 my dear you ramble my gown 1 was mrs assents 
1810 
her assurance however standing sole as it did was not thrown away 
it brought a more cordial more natural smile into his countenance and he replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve 1 we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in style street 
on were so kind as to look back on purpose 
a but indeed i did not wish you a pet pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing 
but i begged mr hope so earnestly to stop 
i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you 
now mrs allies did not oh 
you were not there 
but indeed i did 
and if mr there would only have stopped i would have jumped out and run after yours is there a henry in the world who could be insensible to such declaration 
henry chimney at least was not 
with a yet sweeter smile he said everything that need be said of his sisters concern regret and dependence on catherine honour 
oh do not say miss time was not angry 1 cried catherine because i know she was 
for she would not see me this morning when i called 
i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it 
i was hurt but i was not affronted 
perhaps you did not know i had been there i was not within at the time but i heard of it from elinor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to england the reason of such civility 
but perhaps i can on it as well 
it was nothing more than that my father 
they were just preparing to walk out and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put all made a point of her being denied 
that was all i do assure you 
she was very much vexed and meant so make her apology as soon as possible 
ay northanger abbey 
catherine s mind was greatly teased by thin information yet a something of solicitude remained from which sprang the following question thoroughly ardent in itself though rather distressing to the gentleman 1 but mr tiled why were you less general than your litter 
if the felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be only a mistake why ehould‘jou he to ready to take offence 
7 a me 
i take offence 
7 a nay i am sure by your look when you came into the box you were angry 1 i an i i could have no right 
a wet nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face he replied by asking her to make room for him and talking of the play 
he remained with them some time and wan only too agreeable for catherine to be contented when he went away 
before they parted however it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken at man at possible 
and setting aside the misery of his quitting their box the was upon the whole left one of the happiest creatures in the world 
while talking to each other the had observed with some surprise that john those who wan never in the same part of the house for ten minutes together was engaged in conversation with general tiled 
and the felt something more than surprize when she thought 
she could perceive herself the object of their attention and discourse 
what could they have to may of her 
she feared general time did not like her appearance 
she found it was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter rather than postponed his own walk a few minutes 
a how came mr hope to know your father 
a wan her anxious inquiry at the pointed them out to her companion 
he knew nothing about it 
northanger abbey 
37 but his father like every military man had a very large a chance 
hen the entertainment was over those came to first them in getting out 
catherine wan the immediate object of his gallantry 
and while they waited in the lobby for a chair he prevented the inquiry which had travelled from her heart almost to the top of her tongue by taking in a comequemial manner whether the had seen him talking with general tiled 
4 he is a fine old fellow upon my soul 
stout active 
looks as young at falls in 
i have a great regard for him i 1810 you 
a gentleman-like good sort of fellow at ever lived a but how came on to know him 2 7 a know him 
here are few people much about lawn that i do not know 
i have met him for ever at the bedford 
and i knew his face again to-day the moment he came into the billiard-room 
one of the best players we have both 
bye 
and we had a little touch together though i was almost afraid of him at list 
the oddest were live to four against me 
and if i had not made one of the cleanest stress that perhaps ever wan made in this world 
i took his ball exactly 
but i could not make you understand it without a table however i it 
beat him 
a very one fellow 
at rich as a few 
i should like to dine with him 
i darcy he give famous dinners 
but what do you think we have been talking of 3 you 
yes by heaven 
and the general think you the rest girl in both a oh nonsense 
how can you nay to e 7 a and what do you think i laid 
a lowering fill voice 
well done general a laid ii 1 i am quite of us in a ere catherine who was much let gratified by admiration than general tilney'l was not sorry to be called away by s assent 
there however would are her to her chair and till the entered it continued 8 won-rumour essay 
the same kind of delicate latter in spite of her entreating him to have done 
that general tiled instead of disliking should admire her was very delightful 
and she joyfully thought that there was not one of the family whom she need now fear to meet 
the evening had done more 
much more for her than could have been expected chapter 23 
sunday tuesday wednesday thursday friday and saturday have now passed in review before the reader 
the events of each day its hopes and fears mortifications and pleasures have been separately stated and the pangs of sunday only now remain to be described and close the week 
the clifton scheme had been deferred not relinquished 
and on the aﬁemoon’s crescent of this day it was brought forward again 
in a private consultation between isabella and james the former of whom had particularly set her heart upon going and the latter no less anxious placed his upon pleasing her it was agreed that provided the weather were fair the party should take place on the following morning 
and they were to set off very early in order to be at home in good time 
the affair thus determined and hopes approbation secured catherine only remained to be prize of it 
she had left them for a few minutes to speak to miss tiled 
in that interval the plan was completed and as soon as she came again her agreement was demanded 
but instead of the gay acquiescence expected by isabella catherine looked grave was very sorry but could not go 
the engagement which ought to have kept her from joining in the former attempt would make it imnoumsnonn abbey 
8 possible for her to accompany them now 
she had that moment settled with miss turned to take their promised walk to-morrow 
it was quite determined and she would not upon any account retract 
but that she mr and build retract wan instantly the eager cry of both the hope 
they must go to clifton to-morrow they would not go without her it would be nothing to put of a mere walk for one day longer and they would not hear of a refusal 
catherine was distressed but not subdued 
a do not urge me isabella 
i am engaged to miss tiled 
i can not gone this availed nothing 
the same arguments assailed her again 
she must go she should go and they would not hear of a refusal 
it wouldbeaoeasytotell mile tilneythatyouhad just been reminded of a prior engagemengand must only beg to put on 
the walk till tuesday no it would not be easy 
i could not do it 
there has been no prior engagement but isabella became only more and more urgent 
calling on her in the most affectionate manner 
addressing her by the most endearing names 
she was sure her dearest sweetest catherine would not seriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so dearly 
she knew her beloved catherine to have no feeling a heart sweet a temper to he so easilypersuaded b those she loved 
but all in vain 
catherine felt hens f to be in the right had though pained by such tender such flattering application could not allow it to influence her 
isabella then tried another method 
she reached her with having more affection for miss jane though the had known her so little i while than for her best and oldest friends 
with being grown cold and indifferent in about towards herself 
a i cannoti help being jealous catherine when i see myself bled for strange 
i who love you so excessively 
hen once my affection are placed it in not in the g 9 northanger abbey 
power of anything to change them 
but i believe my feelings are stronger than any body s 
i am sure they tremor strong for my own peace 
and to see myself supplanted in your friendship'llsy strangers does cut me other quick on 
these illness seem to swallow up everything else catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind 
was it the part of a friend thus to expose her feelings to the notice of others 
isabella appeared to her ungenerous and selfish regardless of everything but her own gratification 
these painful ideas crossed her mind though she said nothing 
isabella in the meanwhile had applied her handkerchief to her eyes 
and morals miserable at such a sight could not help saying nay catherine i think you can not stand out any longer now 
the sacrifice is not much 
and to oblige such a friend i shall think you quite unkind if you still refuse 
this was the first time of her brother s openly riding against her 
and anxious to avoid his displeasure she proposed a compromise 
if they would only out of their scheme till tuesday which they might yet do as it depended only on themselves she could go with them and everybody might then be satisfied 
but a no no no i a was the immediate answer 
that could not be for who did not know that he might not go to town on t ye 
catherine was sorry but could do no more 
and a short silence ensued 
which was broken by isabella who in a voice of cold resentment 
said very well then there is an end of the party 
if catherine does not go i can not 
i can not be the chief woman 
i would not upon any account in the world do so improper a thing a catherine you must go a said james 
a but why can not mr sharpe drive one of his other sisters 
i 11 say either of them would like to go 
northangir abbey 
9 
a thank e 1 cried sharpe 
but i did not come to bath to ve my sisters about and look like i fool 
no if you do not go d 
me if i do 
i only go for the sake of driving youth a that is a compliment which gives no pleasure but her words were lost on those who had turned abruptly away 
6 the three others still continued together walking in a most uncomfortable manner to poor catherine 
sometimes not a word was said sometimes she was again attacked with supplications or reproaches and her arm was still looked within isabella's though their hearts were at war 
at one moment she was softened at another irritated 
always distressed but always steady 
i did not think you had been so obstinate catherine 1 said james 
you were not used to be so hard to persuade 
you once were the kindest best-tempered of m sisters 
hope i an not less so now a she replied very feelingly 
but indeed i can not go 
if i am wrong i am doing what i believe to be right 
i suspect a mind isabella in a low voice a there is no rest struggle gather-he’s heart swelled 
she drew away heroism and isabella made no opposition 
thus lasted a long ten minutes till they were again joined by ho who coming to them with s gayer look said a we i have settled the matter and now we may all go to-morrow with a safe conscience 
i have been to miss lucy and made your excuse you have not 
a cried catherine 
a i have upon my soul 
left her this moment 
told her you had sent me to say that having just recollected a prior engagement of going to clifton with us so-morrowélyou could not have the pleasure of walking with her tuesday 
she said very well tuesday 32 born anger grey 
wasjustss convenient to her 
so there is an end of all our difficulties 
a pretty good thought of mine has 2 isabella s countenance was once more all smiles and good-humour and james too looked ha ye again 
a most heavenly thought indeed 
now my sweet catherine all our distresses over 
you are honour 
my acquitted and we shall have a most delightful this will not do said catherine 
a i can not submit to this 
i must run after mine tiled directly and set her right isabella however caught hold of one hand hope of the other 
and remonstrances poured in from all three 
even jane was quite angry 
when everything was settled when miss tiled herself said that tuesday would suit her as well it was quite ridiculous quite absurd to make an further objection 
i do not care 
s there had no business to invent an such message 
if i had thou hat it right to us it off i could have spoken to miss line myself 
his is on doing it in a reader way 
and how do i know that s there has 
he may be mistaken again perhaps 
he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on friday 
let me go mr sharpe 
isabella do not hold me those told her it would be in vain to go after the times they were turning the corner into brick street when he had overtaken them and were at home by this time 
a then i will go after them said catherine 
wherever they are i will go after them 
it does not signify talking 
if i could not be persuaded into doing what thought wrong i never was be tricked into it 
and with these words she broke yawn and hurried off 
there would have darted after her at norland with northanger abbey 
33 held him 
let her go let her go she will go 
she is as obstinate as 
a hope i never finished the smile for it could hardly have been a proper one 
away walked catherine in great agitation as fast as the crowd would permit her fearful of being pursued yet determined to persevere 
as she walked she reflected on what had passed 
it was painful to her to disappoint and displease them particularly to please her brother 
but she could not repent her resistance 
setting her own inclination apart to have failed a second time in her engagement to miss time to have resented a promise voluntarily made only have minutes before and on a false pretence too must have been wrong 
she had not been withstand them on selfish principles alone she had not consulted merely her own gratification 
sam might have been ensured in some degree by the excursion itself by seeing baize castles 
no she had attended to what was due to others and to her own character in their opinion 
her conviction of being right however was not came i to restore her composure till she had spoken to as time she could not be at ease 
and quickening her pace when she got clear of the crescent 
she almost ran over the remaining ground till she gained the top of milsom street 
so rapid had been her movements that in spite of the tilneys’ advantage in the outs they were but just turning into their lodgings as she came within view of them 
and the servant still remaining at the open door she used only the ceremony saying that she must speak with miss time that moment and hurrying by him proceeded up stairs 
then opening the first door red her which ha end to be the right she immediately found he in the drawing-room with general time his son and daughter 
a her explanation 
defective only in being 
from her 34 arranger abbey 
irritation of nerves sad shortness of breath 
no explanation at all was instantly given 
i am come in a great hurry 
it was all i mistake 
i never promised fogs 
i wldthemfrom the rest i could not go 
i ran away in a great hurry to explain it 
i did not care what you thought of me 
i would not stay for the servant 
the business however though not perfectly elucidation by this speech soon ceased to he a puzzle 
catheﬁnetfound that john sharpe bad given the message 
and miss time had no scruples in owning herself greatly surprized by it 
but whether her brother had still exceeded her in resentment catherine though she intuitively addressed herself as much to one as to the other in her vindication had no means of knowing 
whatever might have been felt before her arrival her eager declarations immediately made every look and sentence as friendly as she could desire 
the affair thus happily settled she was introduced 21 miss time to her father and received by him wig such ready such malicious politeness as recalled hopes information to her mind and made her think with pleasure that he might he sometimes depended on 
to such anxious attention was the generous civility carried that not aware of her extraordinary softness in entering the house he was quite angry with the servant whose neglect had reduced her to of the door of the a moment herself 
what did william mean by it 
e should make a point of inquiring into the matter and if catherine had not most warmly asserted his innocence it seemed likely that william would lose the favour of his mother for ever if not his place by her rapidity 
sitting withheld usrterofsnhour she nqrthanger abbey 
33 prized by general tilney’s asking her if she would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the restore the day with her 
miss tiled added her own wishes 
catherine was greatly obliged 
but it wan quite out of her power mr and mrs allies would expect her back every moment 
the general declared he could say no more 
the claims of mr and mrs allies were not to be superseded 
but on some other day he trusted when longer notice could be given they would not refuse to me her to her friend a oh no 
catherine was sure they would not have the least objection and she should have great pleasure in coming 
the general attended her himself to the street door saying everything gallant as they went down stairs admiring the elasticity of her walk which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her dancing and making her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld when they parted 
catherine delighted by all that had passed proceeded gain to pulteney street walking as she concluded with great elasticity though she had never thought of it before 
she reached home without seeing anything more of the offended party 
and now that she had been triumphant throughout had carried her point and was secure of her walk she began as the matter of her spirits subsided to doubt whether she had been perfectly right 
a sacrifice was always noble 
and if she had given way to their entreaties she should have been spared the distressing idea of friend a brother angry and a scheme of great ha ideas to both destroyed perhaps through her means 
of ease her mind and ascertain by the of union of an unprejudiced person what her own conduct d really been she took occasion to mention before mr allies the half-settled scheme of her brother and the horses for the following day 
mr allies caught at it directly 
well a said he and doyouthinkofgoingmo 
36 nonmnuonn ennui 
no 
i had just engaged myselffor walk with miss time before they told me of it 
and therefore you know i could not go with them could i pay a no certainly not 
and i am glad you do not think of it 
these schemes are not at all the thing 
young men and women driving about the country in open carriages 
now and then it in very well 
but going to in and public places together 
it is not right 
and i wonder my horse would allow it 
i am glad you do not think of going 
i am sure my world would not be pleased 
mrs allies are not you of my way of thinking 
do not you think there kind of projects objectionable 
a yes very much so indeed 
open carriages are nasty things 
a clean gown is not have minutes wear in them 
you are placed getting in and getting out 
and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction 
i hate an open carriage myselffor i know you do 
but that not the question 
do not on think it has an odd appearance if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men to whom they are not even related 
a yes my dear a very odd appearance indeed 
i not bear to see it 
dear madam 1 cried catherine then why did not you tell me so before 
i am sure if i had known it to be in proper i would not have gone with mr shore at l 
but i always hoped you would tell me if you thought i warn doing wrong 1 and so i should my dear you may depend on it 
for as i told mrs world at parting i would always do the heat for you in my power 
but one must not be over particular 
young pen leg will be young people as your good mother aye hems f. you know wanted you when we am came not to buy that rugged muslin 
but you would 
young people do not like to be always thwarted born anger abbey 
37 1 but this was something of real consequence 
and idea notthinkyou wouldhavefonnd me hard unpermade.” as far as it has gone hitherto there is no harm done said mr allies 
a and i would only advise you my dear not to go out with mr there any more that is just what i was going to by a added his wife 
catherine relieved for herself felt uneasy for isabella 
and after a moment s thought asked mr allies whether it would not be both proper and kind in her to write to miss sharpe and explain the indecorum of which she must be as insensible as herself 
for she considered that isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to clifton the next day in spite of what had passed 
mr allies however discouraged her from doing any such thing 
a you had better leave her alone my dear she is old enough to know what she is about and if not has a mother to advise her 
mrs there is too indulgent beyond s doubt 
but however you had better not interfere 
she and your brother chose to go and you will be only getting ill-will 
catherine submitted 
and though sorry to think that isabella should be doing wrong felt greatly relieved by mr assents approbation of her own conduct and truly rejoiced to be preserved by his advice from the danger of falling into such an error herself 
her escape from being one of henry to clifton was now an escape indeed 
for what would the times have thought of her if she had broken her promise to them in order to do what was wrong in itself if she had been guilty of one breach of propriety only to enable her to be guilty of another

chapter 1 7 
he next morning was fair and catherine almost expected another attack from the assembled nay 
with mr fallen in no port her she felt no dread of the event 
but she would gladly be spared a test where victory itself was painful and was heartily rejoiced therefore at neither seeing nor hearing anything of them 
the till called for her at the appointed time and no new difficulty arising no sudden recollection no unexpected summons no impertinent intrusion to disconcert their mum my heroine was most unnatural able to fulfill her engagement though it was made with the hero himself 
they determined on walking round beachey claim that noble hill whose beautiful verdure and hanging caprice render it no striking on object from almost every opening in bath 
a i never look at it a said catherine as they walked along the side of the river 1 without thinking of the south of face 
a you have been abroad then i said henry a little surprized 
a oh 
no i only mean what i have read about

thank you elinor 
a most honourable testimony 
you see miss gowland the injustice of your suspicions 
here was i in my senses to get on repining to wait only have minutes for my sister 
taking the promise i had made of reading it aloud and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part by running away with the volume which you are to observe was her own particularly her own 
i am proud when i reflect on it and i think it must establish me in your good opinion a i very glad to hear it indeed 
and now i shall never be ashamed of liking udolpho myself 
but i really thought before young men despised novels amazingly 
a it is amazingly it may well suggest past if they do for they read nearly as many as women

you are more nice than wise 
come miss morton let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction while we praise udolpho in whatever terms we like best 
it is a most interesting work 
you are fond of that kind of reading 
7 a to say the truth i do not much like any other a indeed l 1 
a that is i can read tray and play s and things of that sort and do not i like travels 
but history real solemn history i can not be interested in 
can you 
a northern goers abbey 
10 
a yes i am fond of history i wish i were too 
i read it a little as acutely 
but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me 
the quarrels of hopes and kings with was or pestilences in every page 
the men all so good for nothing and hardlfyzzny women at all it is very tiresome 
and yet i i think it odd that it should be so dull for a great deal of it must be invention 
the best that are put into the horses mouths their thoughts and designs the chief of all this must he invention and invention is what delights me in other books 1 historian you think a said miss time a are not happy their lights of fancy 
they display imagination without raising interest 
i am fond of history and am very well contented to take the false with the true 
in the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and regards which may be as much depended on i conclude as anything that does not actually pass under one own observation 
and as for the little embellishment you speak of they are embellishments and i like them as such 
if a speech be well drawn up i read it with pleasure by whomsoever it may be made and probablyiwith much greater if the production of mr home or 1 robert than if the spine words of csractacus apricot or afraid the rear 
a you are fond of history 
and so are mr fallen and my father 
and i have two brothers who do not dislike it 
so man instances within my small circle of friends is remarkably at this rate i shall not pity the writer of history any longer 
if people like to read theirbooks its allverywell 
but to be at so much trouble in calling great volumes which as i used to think nobody would willingly ever look into to he labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls to 
northanger abbey 
always a much meunhnrdfate 
and both know it in very right and necessary i have often wondered at the persons courage that could sit down on purpose to do it that little boy and girl should be tormented said henry is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civility state can deny 
but in behalf of our most distinguished historian i must observe that they might well be offended at being an added sir 
have no higher aim 
and that by their to add and less they are clay well qualified to torment readers x the most a danced reason and mature time of life 
i used the very a to torment 1 an i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct 1 supposing them not be now admitted an synonimoue.” 
you think me foolish to call instruction 2 torment 
but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then assuming to spell if you had ever seen how stupid they car 
be for a whole morning together and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it an i am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home you would allow that to torment and to inflict 
might sometime be used an cynonimoue words 
very probably 
but histories are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read 
and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very mere very intently application ma perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very we worth while to be tormented for two or three year of one's life for the lake of being able to read all the nest of it 
consider if reading had not been taught man radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all 
catherine mute 
and a very warm panegyric from her on that lady merits cloud the subject 
the -5 7 1 t northanger abbey 
10 illness were soon engaged in another on which the had nothing to say 
they were viewing the country with the eyes of persons accustomed to drawing 
and decided on its capability of being formed into pictures with all the eagerness of real taste 
here catherine was quite lost 
she knew nothing drawing 
nothing of taste 
and she listened to them with an attention which brought her little pratt for they talked in phrase which conveyed scarcely any idea to her 
the little which she could understand however appeared to contradict the very few notions she had entertained on the matter before 
it seemed as if a good view were no longer to be taken from the top of on high hill and that a clear blue sky was no loin or a proof of a one day 
she was hear my ashamed of her ignorance 
a misplaced shame 
where people wish to attach they should always be ignorant 
to come with a well-informed mind is to come with an inability of administering to the vanity of others which a sensible person would always wish to avoid 
a woman especially if she have the misfortune of knowing any thing should conceal it as well as she can 
the advantages of natural folly in a beautiful girl have been already set forth by the capital pen of a sister author 
and to her treatment of the subject i will only add injustice to men that though to the larger and more trifling part of the sex imbecility in females is a great enforcement of their personal charms there is a portion of them too reasonable and so well-informed themselves to desire anything more in woman than ignorance 
but catherine did not know her own advantages 
did not know that a good-looking 12 with an affectionate heart and a very ignorant in can not fail of attracting a clever young man unless circumstances are particularly untoward 
in the present instance the confessed and lamented her want of knowing northanger abbey 
ledge 
declared that she would give anything in the world to be able to draw 
and a lecture on the picturesque immediately followed in which his instructions were so clear that she soon to see beauty in everything admired by him 
and her action was so earnest that he became perfectly satisfied of her having a great deal of natural taste 
live talked of fore-grounds dances and second distance 
side-screens and respect ives 
lights and shades 
and catherine was so hopeful a scholar that when they gained the top of beachey cliff she voluntarily rejected the whole city of bath as unworthy to make part of a landscape 
delighted with her progress and fearful of marrying her with too much wisdom at once henry suffered the subject to decline and by an easy transition from a piece 1 
lucky frames and the withered oak which he had placed near it summit 
to oaks in general 
to foresee the enclosure of them waste lands crown lands and government 
he shortly found himself arrived at attics 
and from limits it was an steps to escape 
the general pause which succeeded his short dilquiliﬁon on the state of the nation was put an end to by catherine who in rather a solemn tone of voice uttered these words a i have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in london miss time to whom this was chiefly addressed was startled and hastily 
indeed 
and of what nature 
a that i do not know nor who is the author 
i have only heard that it is to he more horrible than nothing we have met with yet a good heaven 
where could you bar of arch a thin 
a heap particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter london yesterday 
it is to be uncommonly dreadful 
i shall expect harder and'everything of the kind 14 
northanger abbey 
200 1 you with astonishing composure 
but i hope your ends accounts have been exaggerate 
and if such a design is known beforehand proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to expect 
government 1 said henry endeavouring not to smile a neither desires not dares to interfere in such matters 
there must be order and government cares not how much the ladies stared 
he laughed and added a come shall i make you understand each other or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can 
no i will be noble 
i will prove myself a man no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head 
i have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours 
perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen 
perhaps they may want observation discernment judgment 
are genius and wit 
miss morton do not mind what he says 
but have the goodness to satisfy me as no thisdresdful riot 1 riot 
— what riot 
7 a my dear elinor the riot is only in your own brain 
the confusion there is scandalous 
miss morton has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out in three duodecimo volumes two hundred and seventeen pages in each with a fmntispiece to the rest of two tombstones and a later 
do you understand 
and you miss morton 
my star did sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions 
or talked of expected hours in london 
and instead of instantly conceiving as any rational creature would have done that such words could relate only to a circulating library 
she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men dog nonmanosn annum 
assembling in st george fields 
the bank attacked the power threatened the meets of london glowing with blood a attachment of the north light crayons the hopes of the nation called up from northampton to equally the indulgent and the gallant captain frederick time in the moment of changing at the head of his troop knocked off his horse by a brick-hat from an upper window 
forgive her stupidity 
the fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman 
but she is by no means a simpleton in general catherine looked grave 
a and now henry 1 said miss time that you have made us understand each other you may as well make miss morton understand yourself unless you mean to have her think you intolerable rude to your sister and a great brute in you opinion of women in general 
miss morton is not used to your add ways i shall he most happy to make her better acquainted with them 
no doubt 
but that is no explanation of the present what am i to do 
you know what you ought to do 
clear your character handsomely before her 
tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women 
miss world i think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world especially of those whoever they may be with whom i happen to be in company 
that is not enough 
be more serious 
a miss norland no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than i do 
in my opinion nature has given them so much that they never end it use a use more than half 
a we shall get nothing more serious from him now miss morton 
he is not in a sober mood 
but i korthanger abbey 
-5 assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all or an unkind one of me it was no effort to catherine to believe that henry time could never be wrong 
his manner might sometimes surprize but his meaning must always be just 
and what she did not understand the was almost as ready to admire as what she did 
the whole walk was delightful and though it ended too soon its conclusion wasdelightfultoo 
her friends attended her into the house and miss time before they parted addressing herself with respectful form as much to mrs allies stop catherine petitioned for the pleasure of her corn ay to dinner on the day after the next 
no defect say was made on mrs assents side and the only difficulty on catherine was in concealing the excess of her leisure 
the morning had passed away so chancing us to banish all her friendship and natural affection 
for no thought of isabella or amuses crossed her mind during their walk 
when the times were gone she became amiable again but she was amiable for some time to little expect 
mrs allies had no intelligence to give that could relieve her anxiety 
she had heard nothing of any of them 
towards the end of the morning however catherine having occasion for some indispensable yard of ribbon which must be bought without a moment's delay walked out into the town and in bond street overtook the second miss hope as she was loitering towards edward buildings between two of the sweetest girls the world who had been her dear friends all the morning 
from her she soon learned that the party to clifton had taken place 
the set of 
at eight this morning said miss anne a and em tune i do not envy them theirdrive 
i think you so i are farewell of be out of the scrape 
it must he the dullest thing in the world for there is not a soul it clifton at this 18 nonmanoen new 
time of the 
balls went with your brother and john drove arise catherine spoke the pleasure she really felt on hearing thin part of the amngernent 
a oh 
yes a rejoined the other a maria is one 
she was quite wild to go 
she thought it won d be something very one 
i can not say i admire her taste 
and for my part i was determined from the first not to go if they pressed me ever in much 
catherine a little doubtful of this could not help answering 1 i wiahayou could have gone too 
it in a pity you could not i go thank you but it in quite a matter of indifference to me 
indeed i would not have gone on any account 
i wan saying no to employ and sophia when you overtook up 
a catherine was still unconvinced 
but glad that anne should have the friendship of an family and 3 sophia to console her the bade her adieu without much uneasiness and returned home pleased that the party had not been prevented by her refusing to join it and very heartily wishing that it might be too pleasantly to allow either men or isabella m resent her redatanca any longer 
chapter 19 
early the next day a note from isabella speaking peace and tenderness in every line and entreating the immediate presence of her friend on a matter of the utmost importance hastened catherine in the map lent state of confidence and curiosity to edward 
b 1 doings 
the two youngest miss three were by themselves in the parlour and on anne s quitting it to call her deter catherine took the opportunity of asking northanger abbey 
13 the other for some particular of their yesterday stay 
x“mariaderirud no greater plemrethnntoepeakofit 
and catherine immediately learned that it had been altogether the most delightful scheme in world that nobody could imagine how charming it had been and that it had been more delightful 
than an body could conceive 
such was the information of the rate have minutes 
the second unfolded thus much in detail that they had driven directly to the york hotel ate some soup and spoke an early dinner walked down to the room tasted the water and laid out some shillings in hunters and spare 
thence adjourned to eat ice at a pastrycook’s and hurrying back to the hotel swallowed their dinner in haste to prevent being in the dark and then had a delightful drive back only the room was not up and it rained a little and mr norland home was no tired he could hardly get it along 
catherine listened with heartfelt satisfaction 
it appeared that blame case had never been thought of and as for all the rest there wan nothing to regret for half an instant 
maria s intelligence concluded with a tender effusion of pity for her sister anne whom the represented an ineupponably cross from being excluded the party 
a she will never forgive me i am sure 
but you know how could i help it 
john would have me go for he vowed he would not drive her because she had inch thick uncles 
i dare say the will noble in good humour again this month 
but i am determined i will not be cross 
it is not a little matter that put me out of temper 
isabella now entered the room with so eager a step and a look of wet happy importance an engaged all her friends notice 
maria was without ceremony sent away and isabella embracing catherine thus began 
i 10 born anger all 
yes my dear catherine it is indeed 
your penetration has not deceived you oh that arch eye of yours 
it sees through everything catherine only by a look of wondering ignorance 
a nay my beloved 
friend a eondnmgd’the other compose younge 
am amazing suit as a 
relieve 
let us sit down and taking comfort 
e and so you guessed it the moment you had my note 
sly creature 
oh 
dear catherine you alone who know my hem can judge of my present happiness 
your brother is the most charming of men 
only with i were more worthy of him 
but what will your excellent father and mother say 
oh heavens 
when i think of them i am so agitated 
catherine understanding began to awake 
an idea of the truth suddenly darted into her mind 
and with the natural blush of so new an emotion she cried out good heaven 
my dear isabella what do you mean 
can you 
can you really be in love with james 
a this hold surmise however she soon learnt comprehended but half the fact 
the anxious affection which she was accused of having continually watched in isabella every look and action had in the course of their yesterday received the delightful confession of an e was over 
her hurt and faith were alike engaged to arms 
never had catherine listened to anything so full of interest wonder and joy 
her brother and her friend en gods new to such circumstances the importance of it appeared unspeakably great and she contemplated it as one of those grand events of which the ordinary course of life can hard afford a return 
the strength of her feelings she could not express 
the nature of them however contented her friend 
the happiness of having such a sister was their northangir abbey 
l i l list effusion and the fair ladies mingled in embrace 
and seen of joy 
delighting however so catherine sincerely did in the person of the connexion it must be acknowledged that is slap far surpassed her in tender anticipation 
a you will be no infinitely dearer to me my catherine thpneitheranneormaria 
feel that i shall be to much more attached to my dear norland family than to my own 
this was a pitch of friendship beyond catherine 
a you are so like your dear brother continued isabella a that i quite doted on you the hint moment i saw you 
but no it always is with me the arm moment settle everything 
the very list day that courtland came to us last christmas the very list moment i beheld him my heart was irrevocably gone 
i remember i wore my yellow gown with my hair done up in bride 
and when i came into the drawing-room and john introduced him i thought i never my anybody so handsome before here catherine secretly acknowledge ends the power of love 
for though exceedingly fond of her brother and partial to all his endowments the had never in her life thought him handsome 
a i remember too mine address drank tea with up that evening and wore her price-coloured meanest 
and iii looked to heavenly that i thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her 
i could not keep a wink all night for thinking of it 
oh 
catherine the many sleepless night i have had on our brother account 1 i would not have you rider ha f what i have done 
i am grown wretchedly thin i know 
but i will not pain you by describing my anxiety 
you have seen enough of it 
i feel that i have betrayed myself perpetually 
so unguarded in speaking of m partiality for the church 
but my secret i was way 
we would be safe with you i 12 northanger abbey catherine felt that nothing could 
have been safer 
but ashamed of an ignorance little expected the dared no longer confess the point nor refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate sympathy as isabella chose to consider her 
her brother she found was preparing to set off with all speed to fullest to make known his situation and ask consent 
and here was a source of some real agitation m the mind of isabella 
catherine endeavoured to persuade her as she was herself persuaded that her father and mother would never oppose their songs wishes 
a it is impossible 1 said the 1 for parents to be more kind or more desirous of their children happiness 
i have no doubt of their consenting immediately 
7 a world says exactly the same 1 replied isabella 
and yet i dare not expect it 
my fortune will be so small 
they never can consent to it 
your brother who i hat marry anybody 
a ere catherine again dispersed the force of love 
a indeed isabella you are too humble 
the silver 
once of fortune can be nothing to signifies a oh 
my sweet catherine in your generous heart i know it would signify nothing but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many 
as for myself i am sure i only wish our situations were rehearsed 
had i the command of million were i mistress of the whole world your brother would be my only choice this charming sentiment recommended as much by sense as novelty gave catherine s most pleasing remembrance of all the heroism of her acquaintance 
and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than in uttering the grand ideas 
a i am sure they will consent 1 was her frequent declaration 
a i am sure they will be delighted with you 
a for my own part a mind isabella a my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in more would born anger abbey 
13 be enough for me 
where people are really attached poverty itself in wealth grandeur i detest i would not scale in london for the naivete 
a cottage in some retired village e would be exactly 
there are some charming little a about richmond a richmond 
a cried catherine 
a you must settle near fullest 
you must be near us “lunsureishallbemieei-ableifwedonot 
if i can but be near you i shall be satisfied 
but this is idle talking 
i will not allow myself to think of such things till we have your father never 
norland says that sending it to-night to salisbury we may have it to-morrow 
to-morrow i know i shall never have courage to open the letter 
i know it will be the death of me a reverie succeeded thin conviction and when isabella spoke again it was to resolve on the quality of her wedding-gown 
their conference was put an end to by the anxious young lover himself who came to breathe his parting sigh before he set of for wiltshire 
catherine wished to congratulate him but knew not what to say and her eloquence was only in her eyes 
from them however the evil hat pomp of speech shone out most expressively and arms could combine them with ease 
impatient for the relation of all that he hoped at home his adieu were not long 
and they would have been yet shorter had he not been frequently detained by the urgent entreaties of his fair one that he would go 
twice was he called almost from the door by her eagerness to have him gone 
indeed world i must drive you away 
consider how far on have to ride 
i can not hear to see you linger so 
pyonheaven’s sake waste no more time 
there go go 
i insist on it the two friends with hear now more united than ever wereimepnnbleforthe day 
and in schemes of i 34 northanger abbey 
sisterly happiness the hours few along 
mrs sharpe and her son who were a mind with everything and who seemed only to want 1 norland consent to consider isabella's engagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for their family were allowed to in their counsels and add their duets 
of significant solely and mysterious expressions to all up the measure of curiosity to be raised in the near edged younger sisters 
of catherine sir e feelings this and sort reserve seemed neither lain ye meant nor consistently supported 
and its unkindness she would hardly have forgot pointing out had its inconsistency been less their friend 
but anne and maria soon set her heart at use by the sagacity of their 1 i know what 3 1 and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit a display of family ingenuity 
on one side in the mystery of an affected secret on the other of undefined discovery all equally acute 
catherine was with her friend again the next day endeavouring to support her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the delivery of the letters a need exertion 
for as the time of reasonable expectation drew near isabella became more and more desponding and before the letter arrived had worked herself into a spite of real distress 
but when it did come where could distress be found 
a i have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kind parents and am promised that everything in their power shall be done to forward my happiness 1 were the first three lines mud in one moment all was joyful security 
the brightest glow was instantly spread over isabella s centuries 
all care and anxiety seemed removed her spirits became almost too high for controlled and she called herself without scruple the happiest of mortals 
mrs those with tears of joy embraced her due hear her son her visitor and could have embraced f the horthanger abbey 
i 5 inhabitants of bath with nu'efaetion 
her heart was overflowing with tenderness 
it was dear john 1 and dear catherine at every word 
dear anne and dear maria a most immediately be made share in their felicity 
and two tents 
at once before the name of isabella were not more than that beloved child had now well earned 
john him was no speaker in joy 
he not only bestowed on mr gowland the high commendation of being one of the rest fellow in the world but were off many sentence in his raise 
the letter whence sprang felicity was short containing little more than this assurance of success 
and every particular we deferred till james could write again 
but for circular isabella could well afford m wait 
the s was come raised in mr norland promote his honour we play glad to make everything easy 
and by what mean their income wan to be formed whether landed property wet 
to be resigned or founded money made over was a matter in which her disinterested spirit took no concern 
she knew enough to feel secure of an honourable and speedily establishment and her imagination took a rapid eight over its intended felicities 
she saw herself at the end of a few weeks the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance at fullest the envy of every valued old friend in pulteney with a carriage at her command a new name on her tickets and a brilliant exhibition of hope rings on her in her 
hen the contents of the letter were entertained john those who had only waited its arrival to begin his journey to london prepared to set off a well miss molland 1 said he on finding her alone in the parlour 1 i am come to bid you good-by catherine wished him a good journey 
without appearing to hear her he walked to the window fidgeted about hundred a tune and seemed wholly self-occupied 
1 16 northanger abbey 
shall not you be late at devices pay a said catherine 
he made no answer 
but 
after a minute's silence burst out with 7 a famous good thing this marrying scheme was my soul 
a clever fancy of norland and believe 
hat do you think of it miss morton 
i say it is no bad notion 
a i am sure i think it a very good one 
do you i 
that's honest 
by heavens 
i am glad you are no enemy to matrimony however 
did you ever hear the old song going to one wedding brings on another a 
i say you will come to believe wedding i ho -5 1 esq 
i have promised your sister to he with her if possible 
a and then you know 
— trusting himself about and forcing a foolish laugh 
i say then you know we may the truth of this same old sought a ay we 
but i never sing 
well i wish you a good journey 
i dine with miss ’i‘ilney to-day and must now be going home 7 a nay but there is no such confounded hurry 
who knows when we may be together again put not but that i shall be down again by the end of a fortnight and a relish long fortnight it will appear to me 
then why do you my away so long 
a replied catherine finding that he waited for an answer 
that is kind of you however 
kind and good 
natured 
i shall not forget it in a hurry 
but you have more good-nature and all that than anybody living i believe 
a monstrous deal of good-nature and it is not only good-nature but you have so much 
so much of everything 
and then you have such 
upon my soul i do not know any body like you a oh dear 
there are a great many on less like me i dressy only a great deal better 
brood morning to you 
northanger abbey 
i i 7 a but i nay miss world i shall come and pay my respects at fullest before it in long if not his 
agrmhle.” 1 pray do 3 my father and mother will be very glad to see you 
a and i hope hope miss morton you will not be sorry to see me 
oh dear 
not at all 
there are very few people i am sorry to see 
company it always cheerﬁzl.’ 1 that is most my way of thinking 
give me but 1 little cheerful company let me only have the company of the people i love let me only be where i like and with whom i like and the devil take the rest my i 
and i am heartily glad to hear you say the name 
but i have a notion miss morton you and i think pretty much alike upon most mature 1 perhaps we may 
but it is more than i ever thought of 
and as to mark martin to say the truth there are not many that i know my own mind about by love no more do i 
it is not my way to other in brains with what does not concern me 
my notion only thin in simple enough 
let me only have the girl like any i with a comfortable house over my head and what care i for all the rest 
f fortune in nothing 
i am sure of a good income of my own 
and if the had not a pen why no much the better ever me 
i think kite you there 
if there is a good fortune on one side there can be no occasion for any on the other 
no matter which has it so that there it enough 
hate the idea of one great fortune looking out or another 
and to marry for money i think the wicked thing in existence 
good day 
we shall be very glad to see you at fullest whenever it is convenience and away she went 
it wan not in the power of all his entry to detain her longer 
with such new to communicate 
and inch 3 visit to 1785 rsonmmcen sneer 
prepare for her departure was not to be delayed by anything in his nature to urge 
and she hurried away leaving him to the undivided consciousness of his own ha s address and her explicit encouragement 
he agitation which she had herself experienced on first learning her brothers engagement made her e cut to raise no inconsiderable emotion in mr and mrs allies by the communications the wonderful event 
how great was her disappointment 
the him start affair which many words of preparation ushered us had been foreseen by them both ever since her brother's arrival 
and all that the felt on the occasional comprehended in a wish or the young people happiness with a remark on the gentleman a side in favour of isabella's beauty and on the ladies of her great good luck 
it was to catherine the most surprising insensibility 
the disclosure however of the great secret of james going to fuller the day before did raise name emotion in mrs allies 
she could not listen to that with perfect calmness but me repeatedly regretted the necessity of its concealmengwishe she could have known his intention wished she could have seen him before he went as she should certainly have troubled him with her best regards to his father and mother and her kind compliments to all the kindness 
than 17 
catherine expectations of pleasure from her visit in milsom street were so very high that disappointment was inevitable 
and accordingly though she was most politely received by general finery and kindly welcomed by his daughter 
though henry meat home and no one else of the party she found on her mum without spending many hours in the northanger abbey 
l 19 examination of her feelings that she had gone to her spy intent preparing for happiness which it had not read 
instead of finding herself improved in acquaintance with miss time from the intercourse of the day she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before 
instead of seeing every time to greater advantage than ever in the ease of a family party he had never said so little nor been so little agreeable 
and in spite of their fathers great civilities to her in spite of his thanks invitations and compliments it had been a release to get way from him 
it puzzled her to account for all this 
it could not be general tilney’s fault 
that he was perfectly agreeable and good-natured and altogether a very charming man did not admit of a doubt 
for he was tall and handsome and henry father 
he could not be accountable for his children want of s merits or for her want of enjoyment in his company 
he former she hoped at last might have been accidental and the latter she could only attribute to her own stupidity 
isabella on hearing the class of the visit gave a different explanation 
a it was all pride pride 
insufferable haughu'ness and pride 
she had long suspected the family to be very high and this made is certain 
such insolence of behaviour as miss tilney’s she had never heard of in her life 
not to do the honours of her house with common good breeding 
to behave to her guest with such superciliousness hardly even to speak to her 
a but it was not so bad as that isabella 
there was no in rciliousness 
she was very civil 4 he done defend her 
and then the brother he who had appeared so attached to you 
good heavens well some people's feelings are incomprehensible 
and so he hardly looked once at you the whole day 2

indeed he is unworthy of your unworthy 
i do not suppose he ever think of me a that is exactly what i say 5 he never thinks of you 
such coldness

i really believe john has the most common heart 
14 but as for general till i assure you it would be impossible for any body to have to me with greater civility and attention 
it seemed to be his only cure to entertain and make me happy oh 
i know no harm of him 
i do not suspect him of ride 
i believe he is a very gentleman-like man 
one thinks very well of him and john judgment 
a well i shall lee how they behave to me this evening 
we shall meet them at the rooms 
and must i go 
do not you intend it 
i thought it was all nenled.” nay since you make inch 3 point of it i can refuse you nothing 
but do not insist upon my being very agreeable for my heart you know will be some forty miles off 
and us for dancing do not mention it i beg 
be 
ll quite out of the question 
charles hodges will plague me to death i dare say 
but i shall cut him very short ten to one but he guessed the reason and that in exactly what i want to avoid 
so i shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself 
isabella opinion of the finest did not influence her friend 
she was sure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or sister 
and the did not northanger abbey 
i 2 1 credit there being any pride in their hearts 
the evening rewarded her confidence 
she was met by one with the same kindness and the other with the some attention as heretofore 
is time took pains to be near her and henry asked her to dance 
having heard the day before in milsom street that their elder brother captain silver 
was expected almost every hour she was at no loss for the name of a very fashionable-looking handsome young man whom she had never seen before and who now evidently belonged w their party 
she looked at him with great admiration 
and even supposed it possible that some people might think him handsomer than his brother though in her eyes his air was more assuming and his countenance less prepossessing 
his taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly inferior 
for within her hearing he not only protested against every thought of dancing himself but even laughed openly at henry for sending it possible 
from the latter circumstance it may be presumed that whatever might be our heroine opinion of him his admiration of her was not of a very dangerous kind 
not likely to produce animosities between the others nor persecutions to the lady 
he can not be the instigator of the three villain in horsemen’s great coats by whom she will hereafter be forced into a travelling chaise and four which will drive of 
with incredible speed 
catherine meanwhile undisturbed by presentiments of such an evil or of any evil at all except that of having but a short set to dance down enjoyed her usual happiness with henry tiled listening with sparkling eyes to everything he said 
and in finding him irresistible becoming so herself 
at the end of the first dance captain tiled came towards them again and much to catherine dissatisfaction pulled his brother away 
they retired whispering together 
and though her delicate sensibility did i i 2 2 northanger abbey 
not take immediate alarm and lay it down as fact that captain time must have heard some malevolence misrepresentation of her which he now hastened to communicate to his brother in the hope of separating them for ever she could not have her partner conveyed from her sight without very uneasy sensations 
her suspense was of full ve minutes duration 
and she was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an hour when they both returned 
and an explanation was given by henry requesting to know if the thought her friend miss there would have any objection to dancing as his brother would be most happy he introduced to her 
catherine without hesitation replied that she was ve sure miss there did not mean to dance at all 
he cruel lady was passed on to the other and he immediately led away 
your brother will not mind it i know a said she a because i heard him say before that he hated dancing 
but it was very good-natured in him to think of it 
i so prose he saw isabella sitting down a and fancied she might wish for a partner 
but he is quite mistaken for she would not dance upon any account in the world henry smiled and said a how very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people's actions 1 why 
what do you mean is a with you it is not how is such a one likely to be influenced 
what is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person s feelings age situation and probable habits of life considered 
but how should i intended 
what would be my inducement in acting so and so pay a i do not understand you a then we are on very unequal terms for i understand you perfectly well north anger abbey 
l 2 3 1 me 10 yes 
i can not speak well enough to be unintelligible a brave 
an excellent store on modern language 
a us may tell me what you mean a s i indeed 
do you really desire it 
but you are not aware of the consequences 
it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment and certainly bring on a disagreement between us a no no 
it shall not do either 
am not afraid 
a well then i only meant that your attﬁbudng my brother wish of dancing with miss hope to good-nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good-nature yourself to all the rest of the world 
catherine blushed and disclaimed and the gentleman’redictions were derived 
there was a something 
never in his word.which repaid her for the pain of confusion 
and that something occupied her mind so much that she drew back for some time forgetting to kiss or to listen and almost forgetting where she was 
till roused by the voice of isabella she looked up and saw her with captain tiled preparing to give them hands across 
isabella shared her shoulders and smiled 
the only explanation of this extraordinary change which could at that time be given 
but as it was not quite enough for catherine comprehension she spoke her astonishment in very plain terms to her partner 
a i can not think how it could happen 
isabella was so determined not to dance 
a and did isabella never change her mind before 2 7 a oh 
but because and your brother 
after what you told him from me how could he think of going to ask her i 7 a i can not take surprise to m if on that head 
you bid me be surprized on your friend s account and therefore i am 
but as for my brother his conduct in 24 
northanger abbey 
the business i must own has been no more than i be 
loved him perfectly equal to 
the firmness of your friend was an open attraction 
her firmness you know could only be understood by yourself 1 you are laughing 
but i assure you isabella is very warm in general a it is as much as should be said of any one 
to be always arm must be to be often obstinate 
when poorly to relate is the trial of judgment 
and without reference to my brother i really dusk miss there has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour the friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse all all the dancing was over 
but then as they walked about the room arm in arm 
isabella thus explained herself i do not wonder at your surprise 
and i am really fatigued to death 
he is such a rattle 
amusing enough if my mind had been disengaged 
but i would have given the world to sit still 
a then why did not you pay a oh 
my dear it would have looked so particular 
and you know how i abhor doing that 
i refused him as long as i possibly could but he would take no denial 
you have no idea how he pressed me 
i begged him to excuse me and get some other partner 
but no not he 
after assisting to my hand there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of 
and it was not that he wanted merely to dance he wanted to be with me 
oh such nonsense 
i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me 
for of all things in the world i hated one speeches and compliments 
— 
and so 
and so then i found there would be no peace if i did not stand up 
besides i thought mrs hughes who introduced him might take it ill if i did not 
and your dear brother i am sure he would have been miserable if i had sat down the whole evening 
i “orthanger abbey l 25 am so glad it is over 
my spirits are quite traded with listening to his nonsense 
and then being such a smart young fellow i saw every eye was upon us 
4 he is very handsome indeed 
handsome 
yes i suppose he may 
i dare nyaﬁeople would admire him in general 
but he is not at in my style of beauty 
i hate a word complexion and dark eyes in a man 
however he is very well 
amazingly conceited i am sure 
i took him down several times you know in my way when the young ladies next met they had a far more interesting subject to discuss 
james norland second letter was then received and the kind intentions of his father fully ox lined 
a living of which mr norland was himself patron and incumbent of about four hundred pounds yearly value was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old enough to take it 
no trifling deduction from the family income no niggardly assigned to one often children 
an estate of at least equal value moreover was assured at his future inheritance 
james expressed himself on the occasion with becoming gratitude 
and the necessity of waiting between two and three years before they could marry being however unwelcome no more than he had expected was born by him without discontent 
catherine whose expectations had been as united as her ideas of her father's income and whose judgment was now entirely led by her brother felt equally well satisfied and heartily congratulated isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled 
a it is very charming indeed said isabella with a grave face 
a mr morton has behaved vastly handsome indeed a laid the gentle mrs the looking anxiously at her daughter 
i only wish would do as much 
one no northanger sunny 
could not expect more from him you know 
if he hands he us do more by-and-by i dare say he will 
for i am sure he must be an excellent good-hearted sun 
four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed 
but your wishes my dear isabella are so moderate you do not consider how little you ever want my dear 
it is not on my own account i wish for more 
but i can not hear to be the means of injuring my dear norland making him sit down upon an income hardly en ought to and one in the common necessaries of life 
for myself it is nothing 
i never think of myself i know you never do my dear 
and you will always and your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you 
there never was a young woman so beloved as you are i everybody that knows you 
and i dare say when s morning sees you my dear child 
but do not let us distress our dear catherine by talking of such things 
mr morton has behaved so very handsome you know 
i always heard he was a mostexcellent man 
and you know my dear we are not to suppose but what if you had had a suitable fortune he would have come down with something more 
for i am sure he must be a most liberal-minded many a nobody think better of mr norland than i do i am sure 
but everybody has their failing you know 
and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money 
catherine was hurt by these insinuations 
i am very sure a said she that my father has promised to do as much as he can aﬂord.” bells recollected herself 
a as to that my sweet catherine there can not be a doubt and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me 
it is not the want of more money northanger abbey 
i 2 7 that makes me just at present a little out of spirits 
i hate money 
and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a m i should not have a wish unsatisﬁed 
ah 
my there you have found me on there the sting 
the long long endless two years and a half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living a yes yes my darling isabella a said mrs horse a we perfectly see into your heart 
you have no disguise 
we perfectly understand the present vexation 
and even yet must love you the better for such a noble honest affection catherine uncomfortable feelings began to lessen 
she endeavoured to believe that the delay of the marriage was the only source of isabella's regret 
and when she saw her at their next interview as cheerful and amiable as ever endeavoured to forget that she had for a minute thought otherwise 
james soon followed his letter and was received with the most gratifying kindness 
chapter 17 
he allies had now entered on the sixth week of their stay in bath 
and whether it should be the last was for some time a question to which catherine listened with a blessing heart 
to have her acquaintance with the times end so soon was an evil which nothing could counterbalance 
her whole happiness seemed at stake while the affair was in use and every thing secured when it was determined that the loss goings should be taken for another fortnight 
what this additional fortnight was to prove due to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing henry time made but a small part of catherine s 28 northanger satisfy 
speculation 
once or twice indeed since james engagement had taught her what sold be done she had got so far as to indulge in a secret perhaps a but in general the felicity of being with him for the present bounded her views the present was now comprised in another three weeks and her happiness being remains for that period the rest of her life was at such s distance is to excite but little interest 
in the course of the morning which saw this business arranged she visited miss finery and poured forth her joy full feelings 
it was doomed to he a day of trial 
i sooner had she expressed her delight in mr assents lengthened stay than miss tiled told her of her father s having determined upon quitting bath by the end of another week 
here was a blow 
the past suspense of the morning had been ease and quiet to the present disappointment 
catherine countenance fell 
and in a voice of most sincere concern she echoed miss tilney’s concluding words a by the end of another week 
a yes 
my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what i think a fair trial 
he has been disappointed of some friends arrival whom he expected to meet here and as he is now pretty well is in s hurry to get home a i am very sorry for it a said catherine dejected 
a if i had known this before 7 a perhaps a said miss time in an embarrassed manner you would be so good 
it would make me very happy if 4 he entrance of her father put a stop to the civility which catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding 
after addressing her with his usual politeness he turned to his daughter and said a well eleanors may i congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend -5 1 northanger abbey 
l 29 i was just beginning to make the request sir as you came in 
well proceed i all means 
i know how much your been is in it 
my daughter miss morton 4 he continued without leaving his daughter time to s at a has been forming a very bold wish 
we leave earth as she has perhaps told you on saturday se'ennight 
a letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted at home 
and being disappointed in m hope of seeing the martins of longbourn and general curtsey here some of my very old friends there is nothing to detain me longer in bath 
and could we isyour selfish point with you should leave it without a single regret 
can you in short be prevailed on to it this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend lesser with your company in gloucestershire 
i am almost ashamed to make the request though its presumption would certainly appear greater to buy cream 
sure in bath than yourself 
modesty such as yours 
but not for the world would i pain it by open praise 
if a can be induced to honour us with a visit you willyhmke us happy beyond expression 
this true we can talker you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place 
we can term t you neither by amusement nor splendour for our m e of living as you see is plain and unpretending at no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make hanger abbey not wholly disagreeable 
northanger abbey 
these were trifling words and wound up catherine feelings to the highest points of ecstasy 
her grateful and gratified heart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language of tolerable calmness 
to receive so flattering an invitation to have her company so warmly solicited 
everything honourable and soothing every present enjoyment and every future hope was contained in it and he acceptance with only the saving cause of papa and 13 northanger abbey 
mamma approbation was eagerly given 
a i will write home direct x a said she a and if they do not object as i dare say they will not 
general sneyd was not less sanguine having already waited on her excellent friends in pulteney street and obtained their sanction of his wishes 
7 a since they can consent to part with you said he we may expect philosophy from all the world 
miss t sneyd was earnest though gentle in her secondary civilities and the affair became in a few minutes as nearly settled as this necessary reference to fullest would allow 
the circumstances of the morning had led catherine feelings through the varieties of suspense security and disappointment but they were now safely lodged in perfect bliss 
and with s merits elated to rapture with henry at her heart and stranger abbey on her 10 she hurried home to write her letter 
mr and i norland relying on the discretion of the friends 
a whom they had already entrusted their daughter felt no doubt of the propriety of an acquaintance which had been formed under their eye and sent therefore by return of post their ready consent to her visit in gloucestershire 
this indulgence though not more than catherine had hoped for completed her conviction of being favoured beyond every other human creature in friends and fortune circumstance and chance 
everything seemed taco-operate for her advantage 
by the kindness of her first friends the artless she had been introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met her 
her feelings her preference had each known the happiness of a return 
wherever the felt attachment she had been able to create it 
the affection of isabella was to be secured to her in a sister 
the times they by whom above all she desired to be favourably thought of outstripped even her wishes in the cry northange'r abbey 
i 3 i flattering measures by which their intimacy was to be continued 
she was to be their chosen visitor she was to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose society she mostly prized 
and in addition to all the rent this roof was to be the roof of an abbey 
her passion for ancient dances was next in degree to her passion for henry finery and castles sold shines mode usually the charm of those reveries which his image did not all 
to see and explore either the ramparts and keep of the one or the sisters of the other had been for many weeks a darling wish though to be more than the visitor of an hour had seemed loo nearly impossible for desire 
and yet this was to happen 
with all the chances against her of house hall place park court and cottage northanger turned up an abbey said she was to be its inhabitant its long damp passages its narrow wells and ruined chapel 
were to be within her daily reach and she could not entirely subdue the hope of some additional depends some awful memorials of an injured and ill-used sun 
it was wonderful that her friends should seem so little elated by the possession of such a home 
that the consciousness of it should be so weak born 
the power of early habit only could account or it 
a distinction to which they had been born gave no pride 
their superiority of abode was no more to them than their superiority of person 
man were the inquiries she was eager to make or miss line 
but so active were her thoughts that when these inquiries were lowered she was hardly more assured than before of northanger abbey having been s richly endowed convert at the time of the reformation of its having fallen into the hands of an actor of the times on its disposition of a large portion of the ancient building still making a part of the 1 32 v northanger abbey 
resent dwelling although the rest was deceived or of its standing low in a valley sheltered from the north ancestry rising woods oak 
chapter 23 
it 
a mind thus full of happiness catherine was hardly aware that two or three days had passed away without her seeing isabella for more than a few minutes together 
she began trust to be sensible of this and to sigh for her conversation as the walked along the pump-room one morning by mrs assents side without anything to say or to hear 
and scarcely had she felt a five minutes longing of friendship before the object of it appeared and inviting her to a secret conference led the way to a seat 
this is my favourite place said she as they sat down on a bench between the doors which commanded a tolerable view of everybody entering at either it is so out of the way catherine observing that isabella's eyes were continually bent towards one door or the other as in eager expectation and remembering how often she had been falsely accused of being arch thought the present a one maturity for being really so and therefore gaily said a or not be uneasy isabella 
james will soon be here 
she 
my dear creature 1 she replied 1 do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to convince him to my elbow 
it would be hideous to be always together 
we should be the jest of the place 
and so you are going to northanger 
i am amazingly glad of it 
it is one of the finest old places in england i understand 
i shall depend upon a most particular description of it 
northanger abbey 
1789 1 you shall certainly have the best in my power to give 
but who are you looking for 
are your sister coming 
7 a i am not looking for anybody 
one eyes must be somewhere and you know what a foolish trick i have of fixing mine when my thoughts are an hundred miles 11 
i am amazingly aunt 
i believe i am the most absent creature in the world 
time says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp 1 but i thought isabella you had something in particular to tell me up 7 a oh yes 
and so i have 
but here is a proof of what i was saying 
my poor head 
i had quite forgot it 
well the thing is this i have just had a letter from john 
you can guess the contents 5 no indeed i can not -5 1 my sweet love do not be so abominably affected 
what can he write about but yourself 
you know he is over head and ears in love with you a with me dear isabella 
a 5 no my sweetest catherine this is being quite absurd 
modest and all that is very well in its way but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming 
i have no idea of being so overstrained 
it is wishing for compliments 
his attentions were such as a child must have noticed and it was but half an hour before he left bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement 
he says so in this letter 
says that he as good as made you an offer and that you received his advances in the kindest way and now he wants me to urge his suit and say all manner of pretty things to you 
so it is in vain no object ignorance 
catherine with all the earnestness of truth expressed her astonishment at such a charge protesting her innocence of every thought of mr there s being in love with her and the consequent impossibility of her having 
34 norteanger abbey 
ever intended to encourage him 
as to any attentions on his side i do declare upon my honour i never was sensible of them for a moment except just his asking me to dance the list day of his coming 
and as to making me an offer or any thing like it there must be some unaccountable mistake 
i could not have mieundemood a thing of that kind you know 
and up i ever wish to be believed i solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us 
the last half hour before he went away 
it must be all and completely a mistake for i did not see him once that whole morning 
but bath on certainly did for you spent the whole morning in goddard s buildings 
it was the day your father s consent came and i am pretty sure that you and john were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house 
are you 
well if you say it it was so i dare say 
but for the life of me i can not recollect it 
i do remember now being with you and seeing him an well an the rest 
but that we were ever alone for ever minutes 
however it is not worth arguing about for whatever might pass on his side you must be convinced by my having g no recollection of it 
that never thought nor expected nor wished for anything of the kind from him 
i am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side 
i never had the smallest idea of it 
pray undeceive him as soon as yours and tell him i beg his pardon 
that is i do not know what i ought to say 
but make him understand what i mean in the properest way 
i would not speak disrespectfully of a rather of ours isabella i am sure but you know very well that i could think of one man more than another it is not the person isabella was silent 
a my dear friend you must not be angry with me 
i can not supply northanger linger 
1810 prose your brother cares so very much about me 
and you know we shall still be sisters yes yes a slight a blush there are more ways than one of our gang sisters 
but where am i wanderings 
well my dear catherine the case seems to be 
that you are determined against poor john is not it so 
a i certainly can not return his aﬂ‘ecﬁ'on and as certainly never meant to encourage it since that is the case i am sure i shall not tease you any further 
john desired me to speak to you on the subject and therefore i have 
but i confess as soon as i read this letter i thought it a very foolish t imprudent business and not likely to promote the good of either 
for what were you to live upon supposing you came together 
you have both of you something to be sure but it is not a true that will support a family now-a-days 
and after all that romance may say there is no doing without money 
i only wonder john could think of it 
he could not have received my last 
you do acquit me then of anything wrong 
you i are convinced that i never meant to deceive your brother never suspected him of liking me till this moment 
a oh 
as to that answered isabella laughingly 1 i do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been 
all that is best known to yourself 
a little harmless station or so will occur and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by 
but you may be assured that i am the last v in the world to judge you severely 
all those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirits 
what one man one day you know one may not mean the next 
circumstances change opinions alter 
but my opinion of your brother never did alter 
it l 36 northanger abbey 
was always the same 
you are describing what never happened 1 my dearest catherine continued the other without at all listening to her a i would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about 
i do not think an long would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother because he is my brother and who perhaps after all you know might be just as happy without you 
for people seldom know what they would be at young men espeda‘l’ly they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant 
hat i say is why should a brother happiness be dearer to me than a friend 
you know i carry my notions of friendship pretty high 
but above all things my dear catherine do not be in a hurry 
take my word for it that if you are in too great a hurry you will certainly live to repent it 
time says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections 
and i believe he is very right 
ah 
here he comes 
never mind he will not see us i am sure a catherine looking up perceived captain tiled 
and isabella earnestly fixing her eye on him as she spoke soon caught his notice 
he approached immediately 1 and took the seat to which her movements invited him 
his first admirer made catherine start though spoken low she could distinguish a what 
always to be watched in person or by proxy 
a push nonsense 
a was isabella's answer in the same half whisper 
a why do you put such things into my head 
if i could believe it l 
my spirit you know is pretty independence a i wish your heart were independent 
that would be enough for me my heart indeed 
what can you have to do with hearts 
you men have none of you any hearts northanger essay 
37 if we have not hearts we have eyes 
and they give us torment enough do they 
i am sorry for it 
i am sorry they and an g so disagreeable in me 
i will look another way 
hope this pleases you a turning her back on him 
a i hope your eyes are not tormented now a never more so forth edge of a blooming cheek is still in view 
at once too much and too little catherine heard all this and quite out of countenance could listen no longer 
amazed that isabella could endure it and jealous for her brother she rose up and saying she should join mrs allies proposed their walking 
but for this isabella showed no inclination 
she was so amazingly tired and it was so odious to parade about the pump-room 
and if she moved from her seat she should miss her sisters she was expecting her sisters every moment so that her dearest catherine must excuse her and must sit quietly down again 
but catherine could be stubborn too 
and mrs allies just then coming up to propose their returning home she joined her and walked out of the pump-room leaving isabella still sitting with captain tiled 
with much uneasiness did she thus leave them 
it seemed to her that captain time was falling in love with isabella and isabella unconsciously encouraging him 
unconsciously it must be for isabella attachment to james was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement 
to doubt her truth or good intentions was impossible 
and yet during the whole of their conversation her manner had been odd 
she wished isabella had talked more like her usual self and not so much about money 
and had not looked so well pleased at the light of captain tiled 
how strange that she should not perceive his admiration 
catherine longed to give her a hint of it to put her on her guard and prevent ill the pain which her too lively behaviour key 1 38 nonmnuozn abbey 
might otherwise create both for him and her brother 
the corn lament of john thorpe’l affections did not make amends for thin thoughtless in his sister 
she was almost as far from believing as from wishing it to be sincere 
for the had not forgotten that he could minute 
and his assertion of the offer and of her encouragement convinced her that his mistaken could mmetirnee be very gracious 
in vanity therefore the gained but little her chief pratt was in wonder 
that he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in love with her war a matter of lively astonishment 
isabella talked of hit attendant 
my had never been sensible of any 
but isabella had said many things which the hoped had been spoken in hate and would never be laid again 
and upon this the was glad to rest together for present ease and comfort 
chasm 13 1 
few days passed away and catherine though not allowing herself to inspect her friend could not help watching her closely 
the result of her obeervan'one was not agreeable 
isabella seemed an altered creature 
when the raw her indeed surrounded only by their immediate friend 
in edward buildings or pulteney street her change of manners was to trying that had it gone no farther it might have passed unnoticed 
a something of languid indifference or of that boasted absence of mind which catherine had never heard of before would occasionally come across her 
but had nothing worse appeared boy might only have spread a new grace and inspire a warmer interest 
but when catherine saw her in nonmanonn abbey 
39 public admitting captain tilney’s attentions as readily as they were offered and allowing him almost an equal share with james in her notice and smiles the alteration became too positive to be past over 
what could be meant by such unsteady conducrtwhat her friend could be at was beyond her 
comprehends 
isabella could not be aware of the pain she was inviting 
but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which catherine could not but resent 
james was the sufferers 
she saw him grave and uneasy 
and however careless of his present comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart to over it was always an object 
for poor captain tiled too she was greatly concerned 
though his looks did not please her his name was a passion to her goodwill and she thought with sincere companion of his approaching disappointment 
for in to of what she had believed herself to overhear in thengumproom his behaviour was so incompao'bh with a knowledge of isabella's engagement that she could not upon rejection imagine him aware of it 
he might be jealous of her brother as a rival but if more had seemed implied the fault must have been in her misapprehension 
she wished by a gentle remonstrance to remind isabella of her situation and make her aware of this double unkindness 
but for eminence either of utility or comprehension was always against her 
able to suggest a hint isabella could never under it 
in this distress the intended do rapture of the time family became her chief console action 
their journey into gloucestenhire was to take place within a few days and captain tilney’s removal would at lean restore peace to every heart but his own 
but captain time had at present no intention of removing 
he was not to be of the style boulanger he was to continue at bath 
hen catherine knew this her resolution was directly made 
she spoke to henry 14 northanger abbey 
till on the subject regretting his brothers evident a try for miss sharpe and entreating him to make own her prior engagement 
a my brother does know it a was henry answer 
does he i then why does he stay here i 
he made no reply and was beginning to talk of something else 
but she eagerly continued a why do i not you persuade him to go away 
the longer he stays the worse it will be for him at last 
pray advise him for his own take and for everybody sake leave bath directly 
absence will in time make him comfortable again 
but he can have no hope here and it is only at no to be miserable henry smiled and said a am sure my brother would not wish to do that 
a then you will persuade him to go away 
a persuasion in not at command 
but pardon me if i can not even endeavour to persuade him 
i have myself told him that miss there is engaged 
he knows what he in about and must be his own master 
a no he does not know what he in about a cried catherine 
4 he does not know the pain he is giving my brother 
not that james has ever told me so but i am sure he is very uncomfortable 1 and are you sure it is my brother doing 2 7 a yes very sure 
is it my brother attention to miss hope or miss 
hopes admission of them that gives the in a play a it not it the same thing 
7 a i think mr world would acknowledge a difference 
no man in offended by another man admiration of the woman he loves 
it in the woman only who can make it a torment catherine blushed for her friend and said a isabella in wrong 
but i am sure she can not mean to torment northanger abbey 
14th for she is very much attached to my brother 
she has been in love with him ever since they first met and while m father's consent was uncertain she fretted herself most into a fever 
you know she must be attached to him 
a i understand 
she is in love with james and spirits with frederick 7 a oh no not spirits 
a woman in love with one man can not dirt with another 
7 a it is probable that she will neither love no well nor first so well as she might do either bingley the gentlemen must each give up a little 
after a short pause catherine resumed with 
then you do not believe isabella so very much attached to my brother a i can have no opinion on that subject but what can your brother mean 
if he knows her engagement what can he mean by his behaviour s 
a you are a very close uestioner.’ 1 am i 
only as i want be told 
but do you only ask what i can be expected to tell 7 a yes i think so 
for you must know your brother's heart 
7 a my brother heart as you term it on the present occasion i assure you i can only guess at 
well 
a dwell 
nay if it is to be guesswork let us all guest for ourselves 
to be guided by second-hand conjecture is pitiful 
the premises are before you 
my brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man 
he has had about a week s acquaintance with your friend and he has known her engagement almost a long as he has known her well a said catherine safer some moments consideration “_yssmaybesblemguess at your brother's 42 northanger abbey 
inteno’nnl from all thin 
but i am me i can not 
but in not or father uncomfortable about it 
does not he want captain time to go away 
sure if your father were to speak to him he would go my dear in world a laid henry in thin amiable solicitude for your brother's comfort may you not be a little mistaken 
are you not carried a little too far 
would he thank you either on his own account or miss sharpen for supposing that her affection or at least her good behaviour is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of captain line 
ii he safe only in solitude 
or in her heart constant to him only when solicited by any one else 
he can not think this and on my be sure that he would not have you think it 
will not say do not be on a because i know that you are so at this moment 
t be an little uneasy at you can 
you have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend 
depend upon it therefore that real really never can exist between them 
depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration 
their hearts are open to each other at neither heart can be to on they know exactly what in required and what can home 
and you may be certain that one will never tune the other beyond what in known to be extant perceiving her still to look doubtful an grave he added though frederick does not leave bath with us he will probably remain but a very short time perhaps i only a few days behind us 
his leave of absence soon sex and he must return to his regiment 
and what then be their acquaintance the nuns-room will drink umbrella there for a fortnight and she will laugh with your brother over poor tilney'e passion for a month catherine would contend no longer again comforts she had resisted it approaches during the whole length northanger a baby 
i 43 of a speech but it now carried her captious 
henry time must know best 
she blamed herself for the extent of her fears and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject again 
her resolution was support by isabella's behaviour in their parﬁnéinterview 
the hopes spent the last evening of bennets stay in pulteney street and nothing passed between the lovers to excite her uneasiness or make her it them in up reprehension 
james was in excellent spirits and isabella most engaging placid 
her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart but that at such a moment was allowable 
and once she gave her lover a hat contradiction and once she drew back her hand but catherine remembered henry instructions and placed it all to judicious affection 
the embraces tears and promises of the parting fair ones marble fancied 
charm 5 
s and mrs allies were sorry to lose their young friend whose good humour and chuse news had made her a valuable companion and in the promotion of whose enjoyment their own had been gently increased 
her happiness in going with miss time however prevented their wishing it otherwise 
and as they were to remain only one more week in bath themselves her quitting them now would not long be felt 
mr allies attended her to milsom street where she was to breakfast and saw her seated with the kindest welcome among her new friends 
but so great was her agitation in finding herself as one of the family and so fearful was she of not doing exactly what was right and of not being able to preserve their good x 44 northanger abbey 
opinion that in the embarrassment of the first live minutes she could almost have wished to return with him to pulteney street 
miss tilney’s manners and henry smile soon did away some of her pleasant feelings but still she was far from being at ease 
nor could the incessant attentions of the general himself entirely re-assumed her 
nay perverse as it seemed she doubted whether she might not have felt less had she been less attended to 
his anxiety for her comfort his continual solicitations that she would eat and his often-expressed fears of her seeing nothing to her taste though never in her life before had she beheld half such variety on a breakfast-table made it impossible for her to forget for a moment that she was a visitor 
she felt utterly unworthy of such respect and knew not how to reply to it 
her tranquillity was not i loved by the general impatience for the appearance of his eldest son nor by the displeasure he expressed at his happiness when captain silly at last came down 
she was quite pained by the severity of his father's reproof which seemed disproportion to the offence 
and much was her concern increased when she found herself the principal cause of the lecture 
and that his steadiness was chiefly resented from being disrespectful to her 
this was placing her in a very uncomfortable situation and she felt great come passion for ca train time without being able to hope or his good wife 1 
he listened to his father in silence and attempted not any defence which confirmed her in fearing that the inquietude of his mind on isabella account might by keeping him long sleepless have been the real cause of his rising late 
it was the first time of her being decided in his company and she had hoped to be now able to arm her opinion of him but she scarcely heard his voice while his father remained in the room 
and xmr'rmrtosk abbey 
45 even afterwards so much were his spirits affected she could distinguish nothing but these words in a whisper to e lesson a how glad i shall be when you are all or 
6 the bustle of going was not pleasant 
the clock struck ten while the trunks were carrying down and the general had fixed to be out of milsom street by that hour 
his great coat instead of being brought for him to put on directly was spread out in the curricle in which he was to accompany his son 
the middle seat of the chaise was not drawn out though there were three people to go in it and his daughters maid had so crowded it with parcels that miss world would not have room to sit 
and so much was he intended by this apprehension when he handed her in that she had some difficulty in saving her own new writing-desk from being thrown out into the street 
at last however the door was closed upon the three females and they set of at the sober pace in which the handsome high-fed four horses of a gentleman usually perform a journey of thirty miles such was the‘distance of northanger from bath to be now divided into two equal sages 
catherine spirits revived as they drove from the door 
for with miss time she felt no restraint 
and with the interest of a road entirely new to her of an abbey before and a curricle behind she caught the last view of bath without any regret and met with every milestone before she expected it 
the tediousness of a two hours wait at petty farce in which there was nothing to be done but to eat without being hungry and loitering about without anything to see next followed 
and her admiration of the style in which they travelled of the fashionable chaise and four postilions handsomely diverted rising so regularly in their stirs and numerous outside properly mounted sunk s little under this consequent inconvenience 
46 northan‘ger satisfy 
their 13 been perfectly agreeable the delay would have nothing 
but general time though so charming a man seemed always a check upon his children spirits and scarcely anything was said but by himself 
the observation of which with his discontent at whatever the inn afforded and his angry impatience at the waiters made catherine grow every moment more in awe of him and appeared to lengthen the two hours into four 
at last however the order of release was given 
and much was catherine then surprised by the general proposal of her taking his place in his songs carriage for the rest of the journey 
the day was one and he was anxious for her seeing as much of the country as possible 
the remembrance of mr assents opinion respecting young menus open carriages made her blush at the mention of such a plan and her first thought was to decline it but her second was of greater deference for general tilney’s judgment he could not propose anything improper for her 
and in the course of a few minutes she found herself with hen in the curricle as happy i being as ever existed 
very short trial convinced her that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world 
the chaise and four wheel led off with some grandeur to be sure but it was a heavy and troublesome business and she could not easily forget its having stopped two hours at petty frances 
half the time wo d have been enough for the curricle 
and so simply were the light horses disposed to move that had not the general chosen to have his own carriage lead the way they could have passed it with ease in half a minute 
but the merit of the curricle did not all belong to the horses henry drove so well so quietly without making any disturbance without papa pang to her or staring at them 
so different from the only gentleman-coaehman whom it was in her power to northanger scanty 
-5 compare him with 
and then his hat sat so well and the innumerable capes of his great coat looked so becoming important 
to be driven by him next to being dancing with him was certainly the greatest ha illness in the world 
in addition to every other de night she had now that of listening to her own praise 
of being thanked at least on his sister's account for her kindness in thus becoming her visitor 
of hearing it ranked as real friendship and described as creating real gratitude 
his sister he said was uncomfortable circumstanced 
she had no female companion and in the frequent absence of her father was sometimes without any companion at all 
a but how can that be 
a said catherine 
a are not you with her 
a “northanger is not more than half my home 
i have an establishment at my own house in weston which is nearly twenty miles from my father's and some of my time is necessarily spent there a how sorry you must be for that 
7 a i am always sorry to leave eleanors 1 yes 
but besides your affection for her you must be so fond of the abbey 
after being used to such a home as the abbey an ordinary parsonage-house must ve disagreeable 
a e smiled and said a you have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey to be sure i have 
it not it a fine old place just like what one reads about 
a and are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as what one reads about may produce 
have you s stout heart 
nerves it for solid panel and ancestry e 7 a girl yes i do not think i should be easily frightened because there would be so many people in the home 
and besides it has never been inhabited and 1 45 nonrrrarioiéiz assert 
left deserted for years and then the family come back to it unawares without giving any notice as generally happens 7 no certainly 
we shall not have to explore our way into a hall dismay lighted by the existing members of a wood fire nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows doors or furniture 
but you must be aware that when a young lady is by whatever means introduced into a dwelling of this kind she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family 
while they singly repair to their own end of the house she is formally conducted by forth the ancient housekeeper up a different staircase and along many gloomy passages into an apartment never used since some cousin or in died in it about twenty s before 
can you stand such a ceremony as this 
ill not your mind give you when you and yourself in this gloomy chamber too lofty and extensive for you with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size 
its walls hung worth to my exhibiting gapes as large as life and the bed or dark green stuff or put leg velvet presenting even a funeral appearance 
ill not your heart sink within you 
7 a oh 
but this will not happen to me i am sure a how fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment 
and what will you discern 
not tables toilette wardrobes or drawers but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken late on the other a prosperous chasm which no efforts can open and over the fireplace the permit of some handsome barrier whose features will so incomprehensible strike you that on will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it 
worthy meanwhile no less struck by your appearance gaze on you in great agitation and drops a few unintelligible hints 
to raise your spirits moreover she gives you reason to suppose that the party the abbey you a beau blame non'rmuczn 11 49 inhabit it undoubted haunted and informed you that you will not have a thing e domestic within call 
with this parting cordial the cure of you listen to the sound of her reception footsteps as long an the lame echo can reach on an when with fainting spirits you attempt to listen your door you discover with increased alarm that it has no lock 
a oh i mr tiled how frightful 
this ll just like a book 
but it can not really ha pen to me 
i m sure your housekeeper in not real my worthy 
well what then in a nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the hint night 
after amounting your manner horror of the bed you will retire to rest and get a few hours unquiet slumber 
but on the second or at farthest the third night after our arrival you will probably have a violent itor 
as of under so loud as to seem to shake the advice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains 
and during the frightful guns of wind which accompany it you wig probably think you dance for your lamp in not extinguished one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest 
rumble of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it you will instantly rise and throwing your dreuing-gown around you proceed to examine this mystery 
after a very short search you will discover a division in the ancestry to artfully constructed at to defy the minute inspection and on opening it a. door will immediately apply which door being only secured by masterly burn an a pack you will after a few errors succeed in opening and with your lamp in your hand will pass through it into a small vaunted room a no indeed 
i ill-will be too much frightened to do my such things a what 
not when worthy be given you to under so forth anger abbey 
stand that there is a secret subterranean communication between your a moment and the chapel of st author scarcely two as of 
could you shrink from so simple an adventure 
no no 
you will proceed into this small vaunted room and through this into several others without perceiving anything very remarkable in either 
in one perhaps there may he a dagger in another a few drops of blood and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture 
but there being nothing in all this out of the common way and your lamp being nearly exhausted you will return towards your own apartment 
in me 
passing through the small vaunted room however your eyes will be attracted towards a large old-fashioned cant of body and gold which though narrowly examining the furniture before you had passed unnoticed 
impelled by an in'esisu'ble presentiment you will eagerly advance to it unlocked it folding doors and search into every drawer 
but or sometime without discovering age of importance perhaps nothing but a considerbonrd of demands 
at st however by touching a secret spring an inner competent will open a roll of paper appears you seize it 
it contains many objects of manuscript 
you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber but scarcely have you been able to decided a oh thou whomsoever thou marys be into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched maids may fall a when your lamp suddenly express in the packet and leaves you in total darkness 
a oh no no 
do not say so 
well go on but henry was too much amused by the interest he had raised to be able to carry it farther he could no longer command solemnity either of subject or voice and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancy in the perusal of matilda’s woe 
catherine recollecting herself grew ashamed of her eagerness and began earnestly to assure him that her attention had been fixed without northanger abbey 
is i the smallest asp reversion of really meeting with what be related 
a less time she was sure would never put her into such a chamber as he had described 
she was not at all admit a as they drew near the end of their journey her impatience rap sight of the abbey for some time suspended by his conversation on subjects very different returned in full force and every bend in the road was expected with solemn sum to afford a glimpse of its mass walls of grey stone rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks with the last bars of the sun playing in beautiful splendour on its high nothis windows 
but so low did the building stand that she found herself passing through the great gates of the lodge into the very grounds of northanger without having discerned even an anxious chimney 
she knew not that she had any right to be surprized but there was something in this mode of approach which she certainly had not expected 
to pass between lodges of a modern appearance to and herself with such case in the very presents of the abbey and driven so rapidly along a smooth level road of line gravel without obstacle alarm or solemnity of any kind struck her as odd and inconsistent 
she was not long at leisure however for such considerations 
a sudden sound of rain driving full in her face made it impossible for her to observe anything further and fixed all her thoughts on the welfare of her new straws bonnet and she was actually under the abbey walls was springing with henry assistance from the carriage was beneath the shelter of the old pore and had even passed on to the hall where her friend and the general were waiting to welcome her without feeling one artful foreboding of future to herself or one moment suspicion of any past scenes of horror being used within the solemn evince 
the breeze had not seemed to wait the sighs x 32 northanger abbey 
of the ordered to her 
it had wanted nothing worse than a thick puzzling rain and having given a good shake to her habit she was ready to be shown into the common drawing-room and capable of considering where she was 
an abbey 
yes it was delightful to be really in an abbey 
but she doubted as she looked round the room whether anything within her observation would have given her the consciousness 
the furniture was in all the profusion and elegance of modern taste 
the fireplace where she had expected the ample with and pémdemue carving of former times was contracted to a crawford with sobs of plain though handsome marble and ornaments over it of the prettiest english china 
the windows to which she looked with peculiar dependence from having heard the general talk of his preserving them in their notice form with reverential care were yet less what her fancy had portrait end 
to be sure the pointed arch was preserved the arm of them was this they might be even engagements but every pace was so large so clear so light 
to an imagination which had hoped for the smallest divisions and the heaviest stone work for painted glass dirt and cobb the difference was very distressing 
the general perceiving how her eye was employed began to talk of the smallness of the room and simplicity of the furniture where everything being for daily use pretended only to comfort c. flattering himself however that there were some apartments in the abbey not unworthy her notice and was proceeding to mention the cost gilding of one in particular when taking out his watch he stopped short to pronounce it with surprize within twenty minutes of live 
this seemed the word of separation and catherine found herself hurried away by miss time in such a manner as convinced her that the strictest 21 
my fortune nanny 
m 5 3 punctuality to the family hours would be expected at stranger 
returning through the large and lofty hall they amended a broad m of shining oak which after many nights and many landing-place brought them upon a long wide gallery 
on one side it had a image of doors and it was lighted on the other by windows which catherine had only time to discover looked into a quadrille before miss tiled led the way into a chamber and scarcely staying to hope the would end it comfortable 
left her with an anxious entreaty that the would make no little alteration an possible in her dress 
china 5 
momentary glance wan enough to satisfy catherine that her apartment was very unlike the one which henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the description of 
it war by no means unreasonably large and contained neither ancestry nor velvet the walls were spared the door was completed the windows were neither less perfect nor more dim than than of the drawing-room below 
the furniture though not of the latest fashion was handsome and comfortable and the air of the room altogether far from uncheerful 
her heart instantaneously at case on this point the resolved to lose no time in particular examination of anything a she greatly dreaded obliging the general by an delay 
her habit therefore was thrown off with all possible hate and the wan preparing to upon the linen passages which the chaireaeat had conveyed for her immediate accommodation when her eye suddenly fell on a large high cheat standing back in a deep races on one side of the fireplace 
l i 34 northanger abbey n‘ghtofit made her start 
“dforgetﬁng every thing else she stood gazing on it in motionless wonder while these thoughts crossed her 
this is strange indeed i did not expect such a sight as this 
an immense heavy cheat 
what can it hold 
why should it be placed here 
pushed back too as if meant be out of sight 
i will look into it 
coat what it nut will looking it and directly too 
by daylight 
i my till evening my candle may go out a she advanced and examined it closely 
it wan of year cautiously inlaid with some darker wood and raised about a foot from the ground on carved mudofthe same 
the lock silver though banished from age 
at each end were the imperfect remains of hands also of silver broken perhaps premature by some strange violence 
and on the centre of the said was a mysterious cipher in the same metals 
catherine bent over it intently him without being able to anything with certain 
she could not in whatever direction she took it be eye the laetletterto be at 
and yctthatit shouldbeanything else in that house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment 
if not originally theirs by what strange events could it have fallen into the time family 
her fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater 
and seizing with trembling bends the harp of the lock 
the resolved at all hazards to satisfy herself at last as to its contents 
with difficulty for something seemed to resist her efforts she raised the said a few inches 
but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her starting quit her hold and the said closed with alarming violence 
this ill-timed intruder was mist tilney’l maid sent by her mistress to be of use to miss morton 
and though catherine immediately dismissed her it recalled her to northanger abbey 
39 the sense of what she ought to he doing and feared her in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery to proceed in her dressing without further delay 
her progress was not quick for her thou bets and her eyes were still bent on the object so well c called to interest and alarm 
and though she dared not waste a moment upon a second attempt she could not reason many‘eaces from the best at length however having paper one arm into her gown her toilet seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity mei t safely be indulged 
one moment surely might spared 
and so desperate should be the exertion of her strength that unless secured by supernatural means the said in one moment should be thrown back 
with this spirit she sprang forward and her confidence did not recur ve her 
her resolute effort threw back the said and gave to her astonished eyes the view of a white cotton counterpart properly folded exposing at one end of the best 
in indisposed possession 
she was gazing on it with the first blush of so size when miss tiled anxious for her friends ready entered the room and to the rising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation was then added the shame of being caught in so idle i search 
that is a curious old cheat is not it 
a said miss silly as catherine hastily closed it and turned away to the glass 
a it is impossible to say how many generations it has been here 
how it came to be first put in this room i know not but i have not had it moved because i thought it might sometimes be of use in holding boats and consents 
the worst of it is 
that its weight makes it difficult to open 
in that corner however it is at least out of the way 
catherine had no leisure for speech being at once blushing 
trying her gown and forming wise resolutions 16 uon'rxmozk sunny 
with the most violent dispatch 
miss till xl 1 hinted her fear of being late 
and in half a no down stairs together in an alarm not wholly unfounded or general time was pacing the drawing-room his watch in his hand and having on the very instant of their entering pulled the hall with violence ordered 
dinner to be on table simply 
catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke and at pale and breathless in s most humble mood concerned for his children and detecting old casts 
and the general recovering his politeness as he looked at her spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend who was absolutely out of breath from haste when there was not the least occasion for he in the world 
but catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself till they were happily seated at the dinner-table when the generous complaisant smiles and a good appetite of her own restored her to peace 
the dining-parlour we a noble room suitable in its dines 
don't a much larger drawing-room than the one in common use and lined up in a style of luxury and ease which was almost lost on the unpractised eye of catherine who saw little more than its graciousness and the number of their attendants 
of e former she spoke cloud her admiration 
said the general with a very gracious countenance acknowledged that it was by no name an ill-used room 
and further confessed that though as careless on such subjects as most people he did look upon a tolerably large sitting-room as one of the reveries of life 
he sup however that she must have been used to much better sized apartments at mr allies s 
a no indeed a was catherine honest assurance 
a mr assents dining-parlour was not more than half as northangir abbey 
1 5 7 large 
and she had never seen so large a room as this in her life 
the generous good-humour increased 
why as he bad such rooms he thought it would be simple not to make use of them 
but upon his honour he believed there might be more comfort in rooms of only half their size 
mr allenham house he was sure must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness 
the evening passed without any further disturbance and 
in the occasional absence of general tinged with much sir ve cheerfulness 
it was only in his presence t catherine felt the smallest fatigue from her journey 
and even then even in moments of languor or mind a sense of general happiness preconcerted and she could think of her friends in bath without one wish of being with them 
the night was stormy 
the wind had been rising at intervals the whole afternoon 
and by the time the party broke up it below and rained violently 
catherine as she crossed the hall listened to the temper with sensations of awe 
and when she heard it rage round a corner of the ancient building and close with sudden in s distant door felt for the first time that she was yet in an abbey 
yes these were characteristic sounds they brought to her recollection a countless variety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes which such buildings had witnessed and such storms ushered in 
and most heartily did she rejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within walls so solemn 
she had nothing to dread from midnight assisting or spoken gallant 
henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had told her that morning 
in a house so furnished and so guarded she could have nothing to explore or to supper and might go to her bedroom as securely as if had been her own chamber at fullest 
thus wisely mortifying her mind is she proceeded upstairs she was enabled especially on perrys nonmmczx abbey

and her spirits were immediately added by the cheerful blaze of a wood are

39 though in a situation conspicuous enough had never change her notice before 
henry words the son of the boy cabinets which was to escape her observation at sam immediately rushed across her 
and though there could be nothing really in it there was something whimsical it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence 
she took her candle and looked closely at the cant 
it was not absolutely bounty and gold 
but it was jane black and yellow jargon of the handsomest kind 
and as she held her candle the yellow had very much the effect of gold 
the key was in the door and she had strange fancy to look into it 
not however with the smallest expectation of finding anything but it was so very odd after what henry had said

but how strangely mysterious 
the door was still immovable 
she paused a moment in breathless wonder 
the wind roared down the chimney the rain beat in torrent against the windows and everything seemed to speak the fullness of her situation

catherine heart beat quick but her courage did not fail her 
with a cheek washed by hope and an eye mingling with curiosity her fingers praised the handle of a drawer and drew it forth 
it was entirely empty 
with lets alarm and greater eagerness she seized a

not one was left unabashed and in not one was anything found

impatient to get rid of those hateful evidence of her folly those detestable papers then scattered over the bed she rose directly 
and holding them up as nearly as possible in the same shape as red returned them to the same spot within the cant with a very hearty wish that no untoward accident might ever bring them forward again to disgrace her even with herself 
why the lock should have been so difficult to open however was still something remarkable for she could now manage them with perfect ease 
in this there was surely something mysterious and she indulged in the flattering suggestion for half a minute till the possibility of the doors having been at first unlocked and of being herself its fastened darted into her head and cost her another blush 
she got away as soon as she could from a room in which her conduct produced such unpleasant reflection and found her way with all speed to the breakfastlour as it had been pointed out to her by miss lucy the evening before 
henry was alone in it

a catherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the entrance of the general whose smiling compliments announced a happy use of mind but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not advance her composure

he left the room and catherine with a anxious face began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his own inclination under a mistaken idea of pleasing her 
but she was stop by miss tilney’s saying with a little confirmation “ibelieveitwillbewrsestto takes morning while it is some 
and do not be uneasy on my father's account he always walks out at thin time of day catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood 
why was miss tiled embarrassed 
could there be any unwillingness on the general side to show her over the abbey 
the proof was his own 
and was it not odd that he she always take his walk so early 
neither her father nor mr allies did so 
it was certainly very provoking 
she was all impatience to see the house and had merely any curiosity about the grounds 
if henry had been with them indeed 
but now she should not know what was picturesque when she saw it 
such were her thoughts 
but she kept them to herself and put on her bonnet in patient discontent she was struck however beyond her expectation by the grandeur of the abbey as she saw it for the first time from the lawn 
the whole building enclosed a large court 
and two sides of the quadrille rich in this ornaments stood forward for admiration 
the remainder was shut off by knows of old trees or luxuriant plantations and the steep woody hills rising behind to give it shelter were beauties even in the leaves month of march 
catherine had seen nothing to compare with it 
and her feelings of delight were so strong 
that without waiting for any better authority she boldly hum ford in wonder and praise 
the general listened with assenting gratitude and it seemed as if his own estimation of danger had waited unfixed all that hour

the number of acres contained in this garden was such as catherine could not listen no without dismay being more than double the extent of all mr assents an well as her father's including churchyard and orchard 
the walls accrue countless in number endless in length 
a village of hot-home seemed to arise among them and a whole parish to be at work within the enclosure 
the general was averted by her look of riddle which told him almottaeplainly a he soon for her to tell him in words that the had reverses anygardensat all equal to them before

a but where are you going eleanors 
why do you chose that cold damp path to it

our best way is across the par 1 this is so favourite a walk of mine 1 said miss time that i always think it the best and nearest way 
but perhaps it may he damp t was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old scotch mrs 
and catherine struck by its gloomy aspect and eager to enter it could not even by the general disapprobation be kept from stepping forward 
he perceived her inclination and having again urged the plea of health in vain was too polite to make further opposition 
he excused himself however from attending in 6 the rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him and he would meet them by another course he turned away 
and catherine was shocked to and how much her spirits were relieved by the separation 
the shock however being less real than the relief ordered it no injury 
and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired 
a i am particularly fond of this a said her companion with a sigh 
it was my mother's favourite walk catherine had never heard mrs tiled mentioned in the family before

catherine after tied no longer to hide born herself the nature of the pangs which in spite of all his attentions he had previously excited 
and what had been terror and dislike before was now absolute aspersion 
yes aspersion 
his cruel to such a charming woman made him odious to her 
he had often read of such characters 
characters which mr allies had been used to call unnatural and overdnwn 
but here was proof positive of the contrary 
she had settled this point when the end of the path brought them directly upon the general 
and in spite of all her virtuous indignation she found herself again obliged to walk with him listen to him and even to smile when he smiled 
being no longer able however to receive pleasure from the surrounding objects the soon began to walk with latitude the general perceived it and with a concern for her health which seemed so reproach her for her opinion of him was most urgent for returning with his daughters the house 
he would follow them in a quarter of an hour 
again they parted 
but elinor was called back half minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend born anger abbey

this second instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck catherine as very remarkable

they set forward 
and with a grandeur of air a divided step which caught the eye but could not shake the doubts of the well-bred catherine he led the way across the hall through the common drawing-room and one useless ante-chamber into a room magnificent both in size and furniture the real drawing-room used only with company of consequence 
it was very noble very grand very charming was all that catherine had to say for her indiscriminsn'ng eye scarcely discerned the colour of the mind 
and 1 minuteness of guide all praise that had much meaning was nipped by the general the costing or elegance of any room’n_ﬁtting up could be nothiugtqher

when the generalhadntisﬁedhilown curiosity disclose examination of every well-known ornament they proceeded to the library an apartment in it way equal magniﬁcence exhibiting a collection of books on which an humble man might have looked with catherine heard admired and wondered with more genuine feeling than before gathered all that she could from this warehouse of knowledge by running over the title of half shelf always ready to proceed 
but sides of apartments did not spring up with her wishes 
large as was the building she had already visited the part 
though on being told that with the addition of thekitehen thesixorseven room she had now seat surrounded three sides of the court she could scarcely believe it or overcome the suspicion of there being many chambers secrets 
it was some relief however that they were to return to the rooms in common use by passing through a few of less importance looking him the court which with occasional passages not wholly intricate connected the different sides 
and she was farther soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading what had once been a cluster having traces of calls pointed out and observing several doors that were neither opened nor explained to her 
by finding herself successively in a billiard-room and in the general private apartment without comprehending their connexion or being able to turn aright when she left them 
and lastly by passing through a dark little room owning henry authority and screwed with his litter of books guns and great-coat 
from the dining-room of which though already seen and always to be seen at ve o'clock the general could not forego the pleasure of pacing out the length for the more certain information of allies norland as what she neither doubted nor cared for they pronorthanger abbey

every modern invention to militate the labour of the cooks had been within thin their spacious theatre 
and when the gentle of other had failed his own had often produced the perfection wanted 
his enjoyment of this spot alone might at any time have placed him high among the benefactor of the covert 
with the walls of the kitchen ended all the activity of the abbey 
the fourth side of thequadrangle having on account of its delaying state been removed by the general father and the present directed in its place 
all that was miserable ceased here 
the new building was not only new but declared itself to be no 
intended only for offices and enclosed behind by stable-yard no uniformity of architecture had been thought yeomanry 
catherine could have raved at the hand which had swept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest for the purposes of mere domestic economy 
and would willingly have been spared the mortification of a walk through foresee no fallen had the general allowed it but if he had a vanity it was in the arrangement of his office 
and as he was convinced that 
to a mind like miss norland a view of the accommodations and comforts by which the labour of her inferior were softened must always be sanitizing he should make no apology for leading her on 
hey took a slight survey of all 
and catherine was impressed beyond her expectation by their multiplicity and their convenience

they so get through it all had often amazed mrs allies 
and when catherine saw what was necessary here she began to be amazed herself 
they returned to the hall that the chief ctain‘aae might be ascended and the beauty of its wood and moments of rich carving might be pointed out having gained the top they turned in an opposite direction m the gallery in which her room lay and shortly entered one on the lame plan but superior in length and bath 
she was here shewn successively into three large bed-chamber with their drawing-rooms most completely and handsomely fitted up everything that money and taste could do to give comfort and elegance to apartments had been bestowed on these 
and being furnished within the last have years they were perfect in all that would be generally pleasing and wanting in all that could give pleasure to catherine 
as they were surveying the last the general after slightly naming a few of the distinguished characters by whom they had at times been honoured turned with a smiling countenance to catherine and ventured to hope that henceforward some of the earliest tenants might be a our friends whom fullerton.” she felt the trout tied compliment and deeply regretted the impossibility 
of thinking well of a man so kindly die towards herself and so hall of civility to all her family 
the gallery was terminated by folding doors which north leg abbey

and did she not up her friend might be glad of some refreshment s so much exercise 
miss time drew hack directly and the heavy doors were closed upon the motive catherine who having seen in a momentary glance beyond them a narrower passage more numerous openness and symptoms of a winding staircase believed herself at last within the reach of something worth her notice 
and felt as she unwillingly paced hack the gallery that she would rather he allowed to examine that end of the house than see all the misery of all the rest 
the general s evident desire of preventing such an examination was an additional stimulate 
something was certainly to be concealed her fancy though it had trespass lately once or twice could not mislead her here 
and what that something was a short sentence of miss tilney’s as they followed the general at some distance down stairs seemed to point out

out and look once more 
the clock struck twelve and catherine had been half an hour asleep 
they ﬁﬁl‘ﬁ‘ 
he next day afforded no opportunity for the proposed examination of the mysterious apartment 
it viii sunday and the whole time between morning and afternoon service was required by the general in exercise abroad or eating cold meat at home 
and great as was catherine curiosity her courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner either by the flaring light of the sky between six and even of clock or by the yet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp 
the day no unmarked therefore by anything to interest her imagination beyond the sight of a very elegant moment to the memory of mrs time which immediate fronts the family pew 
by that her eye was in my caught and long retained 
and the perusal of the highly-strained pitch in which every virtue was described to henry the inconsolable husband who must have been in come w or other her destroyer affected her even to tears 
hat the general having expected such a moment should be able to face it was not perhaps very range and yet that he could lit to boldly collected within it view maintain 30 elevated an air look no fears around nay that he should even enter the church learned wonderful to catherine 
not however that any inmate of being equally hardened in guilt might not be produced 
she could remember dozens northamger abbey 
who persevered ineverypossiblevice going from crime to crime muttering whomsoever they chose without any feeling of humanity or remorse till a violent death or s relations retirement closed their black career 
the erection of the moment myself could not in the smallest de affect her doubts of mrs tiluey’s actual decease 
ere she even to descend into the family vault where her shoes were supposed to slumber were she to behold the cousins in which they were said to be closed what could it avail in such a case 
catherine had read too much not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a warmer figure might be introduced and a suppositions funeral carried on 
the succeeding naming promised something better 
the general early walk ill-timed as it was in every other view was favourable here 
and when she knew him to be out of the house she directly proposed to miss tiled the accomplishment of her promise 
eleanors ready to oblige her 
and catherine reminding her as they went of another promise their first visit in consequence was to the traits in her bed-chamber 
it represented a very law my woman with a mild and pensive countenance justifying so far the expectations of its new observer 
but they were not in every respect answered for catherine had depended upon meeting with features air complexion that should he the very counterpart the very image if not of hears of eleanors 
the only mass of which she had been in the habit of thinking no always an equal resemblance of mother and child 
a face once taken was taken for generations 
but here she was obliged to look and consider and study for a likeness 
she contemplated it however in to of this drawback with much emotion 
and last 1 s yet stronger interest would have left it unwillingly 
her agitation as they entered the great gallery was northanger abbey 
28th too great list any endeavour at diuccume 
she could only look at her companion 
eleanors countenance dejected yet-edate 
acquit compouureepoke her inured to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing 
again the passed through the folding-doors again her hand was stand the important lock and catherine hardly able to relate wan turning to close the former with fears caution when the cure the dreaded figure of the general himself at the further end of the gallery stood before her 
the name of “elmoor” at the me moment in hill loudest tone sounded through the building giving to his daughter the ears intimation of his presence and to catherine tenor upon tenor 
an attempt at concealment had been her we instinctive movement on perceiving him yet the could safely hope to have escaped his eye 
and when her friend who with an apologising look darted hastily by her had joined and disappeared with him she ran for to her own room mad forcing herself in believed that she should never have courage to go down again 
she remained there at least an hour in the agitation deeply cornmiaerating the rule of her poor friend and expecting a summon herself from the angry general to attend him in hit own apartment 
no imagine however arrived 
and at in on seeing a carriage drive up to the abbey she wan emboldened to descend and meet him under the protection of visiting the hreakfart-mom was gay with company 
and the wunamedtothembythegeneraluthe amendsof his daughter in a complimentary style which to well conoealedhia resentful hire a to make her feel secure at least 
of life for the present 
and elinor with a command of countenance which did honour to her concern for his character taking an early occasion of saying to her a my father only wanted me to answer a note began hope that head either been unseen 1814 norteanger abbey 
the general or that from some consideration of lucy she should be allowed to suppose herself so 
upon this trust she dared still to remain in his presence after the company left them and nothing occurred to disturb it 
in the course of this comings reflection she came so a resolution of making her next attempt on the forbidden door alone 
it would be much better in every respect that elinor should know nothing of the matter 
to involve her in the danger of a second detection to court her into an apartment which must writing her hurt could not be the office of a friend 
the generous utmost anger could not be to herself what it might be to a daughter and besides she 
thought the examination itself would be more satisfactory if made without any companion 
it would be impossible to explain to elinor the suspicious from which the other had in all likelihood been hitherto happily except 
nor could she therefore in bar residence search air those proofs of the general come by which however they might yet have escaped discovery she felt confident of somewhere drawing or in the shape of some fragments journeys continued to the last grasp 
of the way to the apartment she was now perfectly mistress and as she wished to get it over before henry return who was six on the morrow there was no time so be lost 
the day was bright her courage high 
at forno’cloclt the sun was now two hours above the horizon and it would be only her retiring to dress half an hour earlier than usual 
it was done 
and catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the clock had ceased to strike 
it was no time for thought she hurried on slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors and without stopping to look or breathe rushed forward to the one in question 
the look yielded to her hand and northanger abbey 
18 5 sucking with no sullen sound that could alarm a human being 
on tiptoe the entered the room was before her but it was some minutes before she could advance another step 
she beheld what vexed her to the spot 
and agitated every future 
she saw a large well-proportioned apartment an handsome dignity bed arranged as occupied with an housemaids care a bright bath store mahogany wardrobe and neatly-painted chain on which the warm bars of a western sun gaily poured through two sashes windows 
catherine had expected to have her feelings worked and worked they were 
punishment and doubt first tiled them and a short proceeding say of common sense added some bitter emotions of shame 
she could not be mistaken as to the room 
but how grossly mistaken in everything else in miss tilney’s meaning in her own calculation 
this apartment to which the had given a date so ancient 
a son so awful proved to be one end of what the grass father had built 
there were two other doors in the chamber leading pmhablyinto dressing-closet but the had no inclination to open either 
would the evil in which mrs time had last walked or the volume in which the had it read remain to tell what nothing else was allowed to whisper 
no 
whatever might have been the general s cries he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for detection 
she was sick of exploring and desired but to be safe in her own room with her own heart only privy to its folly and the was on the point of retreating as softly as she had entered when the sound of footsteps she could hardly tell where made her pause and tremble 
to be found there even by a servant would he unpleasant but by the general and he seemed always at hand when lieut wanted much worse 
she listened the sound had ceased and resolving not to lose a moment the passed through and closed the door 
at that invent a 16 stranger abbey

a became it in my nearest way from the stable-yard to my own chamber 
and why should i not come up it 
catherine recalled herself blushed deeply and could lay no more

did not afford 
she moved on towards the gallery

she shewed me over the greatest part on saturday and we were coming here to these rooms but only dropping her voice 
a your father wan with us and that prevented you a said henry earnestly regarding her

i only wanted to see

i must go and dresses a it is only a quarter past four 1 shewing his watch 
and you are not now in bath 
no that no room to prepare for

it always makes me up the most comfortable apartment in the house 
and i rather wonder that elinor should not take it for her own 
she lent you to look at it i suppose 
a 5 no 
a it ha been your own doing entirely 
a catherine 18 northanger abbey 
said nothing 
after a short silence during which he had closely observed her he added a as there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother s character as described by elinor which does honour to her memory 
the world i believe never saw a better woman 
but it it not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this 
the domestic unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent veneration tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours 
elinor i suppose has talked her greatest 2 1 yes a great deal 
that is 
no not much but what she did my was very interesting 
her dying so suddenly 1 slowly and with hesitation it was spoken a and you 
none of you being at home 
and your father i thought perhaps had not been very fond of her a and from these circumstances he replied his quick eye fixed on hers 
a you infer the probability of some negligence 
some 
a no until the shook her head a or it may he of something still less pardonable 
he raised her eyes towards him more fully than the had ever done before my mother's illness 4 he continued the seizure which ended in her death over sudden

a very respectable man and one in whom she had always i placed great confidence 
upon his opinion of her change two others were called in the next day and remained in almost constant attendance for four-and-twenty hours 
on the fifth day she died 
during the progress of her disorder frederick and i we were both at home saw her repeatedly 
and from our own observation can bear wishes to her having received northanger abbey 
1814 every possible attention which could spring from the selection of those about her or which her situation in life could command 
poor elinor am absent 
and at ruchadiat'anceanto return only see her mother her crofts

you have erred in supposing him not attached to her 
he loved her i am waded as well an it w possible for him to e have not all you know the name tenderness of disposition 
and i will not pretend to say that while the lived the might not often have had much to bear 
but though his terms 1 injured her his judgment never did his value her was sincere 
and if not permanently he was truly affected by her duty 
i am very glad of it said catherine

catherine was completely awakened 
henry address short as it had been had more thoroughly opened her eyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several disappointments had done 
most grievously was she humbled 
most bitterly did the cry 
it was not only with herself that shews sunk but with henry 
or folly which now seemed even criminal 
was all exposed to him 
and he must despise her for ever 
the liberty which her imagination had dared to take with the character of his father could he ever forgive it 
the absurdity of her curiosity and her fears could they ever be forgotten 
she hated herself more than she could express 
he had in thought he had once or twice before this fatal morning she something like affection for her 
but now 
in short she made herself as miserable as a e for about half an hour went down when the c lock mock over with a broken heart and could scarcely give an intelligible answer to elinor in sir if she was well 
the formidable hen soon for owed her into the room and the only did presence in his behaviour to her was that he paid her rather more attention than usual 
catherine had never wanted comfort more and he looked as if he was aware of it 
the evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness 
and her spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity 
she did not learn either to forget or defend the past 
but she learned to hope that it would never transpired farther and that it might not cost her henry s entire regard

than that it had been all a voluntary self-created delusion each trifling circumstance receiving importance from an imagination resolved an alarm and everything forced to bend to one 1 one by a mind which before she entered the abbey been craving to be frightened 
she remembered with what feelings she had prepared for a knowledge of northanger 
she saw that the infatuation had been created the mischief settled long before her quitting bath and it seemed an if the whole might be traced to the influence of that can of reading which the had there indulged 
charming at were all mr radcliﬂ'e’e worth and charming even us were the works of all her invitation it wan not in them perhaps that human nature at least in the island counties england wan to be looked for 
of the helps and pyreneeu with their pins foremost and their vice they might give a faithful deliberation 
and its swisserland and the south of face might be an awful in harmony as they were there represented 
catherine dared not doubt beyond her own country and even ofthagifhard preyed would haveyielded the northern and wettest utremin'ee 
but in the centralpart of englandthere was itself security for the existence even of a wife not loved in the lawn of the land and the manner of the age

among the english the believed in their ham and able there was a general though unequal mixture of good and bad 
upon thin conviction the would not be surprized if even in henry and elinor till come alight imperfection might hereafter appear 
am 19 northanger abbey 
this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual packs in the character of their father who though cleared from the grossly injurious suspicions which the must ever blush to have entertained she did believe upon serious consideration to be not perfectly amiable 
her mind made on these several points and her resolution formed i 
always judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense she had nothing to do but to forgive herself and be him her than ever 
and the sentiment hand of time did much or her by insensible gradations in the course of another day 
henry astonishing generosity and nobleness of conduct in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed was of the greatest assistance to her 
and sooner than she could have supposed it possible in the beginning of her distress her spirits became absolutely comfortable and capable as heretofore of continual improvement by anything he said 
there were still some subjects indeed under which she believed they must always tremble 
the mention of a chat or a saint for instance and she did not love the sight of jane in any 
shape but even -5 could allow that an occasional memento of past folly however painful 
might not be without use 
the anxieties of common life began soon to seemed to the alarms of romance 
her desire of hearing from lakes 
grew every day greater 
she was quite impatient to know how the bath world went on and how the rooms were amended 
and especially was she anxious to be assured of isabella's having matched some one netting cotton on which she had left her intent 
and of her continuing on the best terms with james 
her only dependence for information of any kind was on isabella 
james had protested against writing to her till his return to of

but isabella had promised and promised again 
andwhenshepromisedathing she so scrupulous in performing it 
this made it so particularly strange 
for nine success mornings catherine wondered over the repetition of s disappointment which each morning became more severe 
but on the tenth when she entered the breakfast 
room her first object was s letter held out by henry willing hand 
she thanked him as heartily as if he had written it himself 
a t is only from james however a no she looked at the direction 
she opened it it was from oxford 
and so this purpose 
adds currants 
though god knows with little inclination for writing i think it my duty to sell you that everything is st an end between miss sharpe and me 
i left her and bath yesterday never so see either again 
i shall not enter into particulars they would only pain you more 
you will soon hear enough from another anger on know where lies the blame 
and i hope we l acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned 
thank god 
i am deceived in time 
but it is a he blow 
after my father's consent had been so in my hen 
but no more of this 
she has made me miserable e for ever 
let me soon hear from you dear catherine 
you are my only friend 
per love i do build upon 
i wish your visit it northanger may be over before captain time makes his engagement known or you will be uncomfortable circumstanced 
poor who is in town i dread the sight of him 
his honest ear 
would feel so much 
i have written to him and my father 
her duplicity hum me more than all 
tilltheveryllstﬁfl reasoned with her she declared herself as much attached to me as ever and 19 northanger abbey 
laughed at my fears 
i am ashamed to think how long iborewithit 
but ifeverman treason to believe himself loved i was that man 
i must understand even now what she would be at for there could he no need of my being played at 
no make her secure of time 
we parted at last by mutual consent 
happy for me had we never met 
i can never expect to know such another woman i dearest catherine aware how you give your hem 
believe me etc catherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of countenance and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder declared her to be receiving unpleasant news 
and henry earnestly watching her through the whole letter 33 plainly that it ended no better than it began 
he was prevented however from even looking his surprise by his father's entrance they went to breakfast directly 
but catherine could hardly eat anything 
tea called her and even in down her cheeks as she eat 
the letter watson momentinher hand then in her lap and then in her pocket 
and she looked as if she knew not whether did 
the general between his coat and his newspaper had luckily no leisure for noticing her 
but to the other two her dines wan equally visible air soon as she dared leave the table she hurried away to her own room 
but the housemaids were buy in it and the war obliged to come down again 
she turned into the drawing-room for privacy but henry and elinor had likewise retreated thither and were at that moment d in consultation about her 
she drew back trying to g their pardon but was with gentle violence forced to return 
and the then withdrew after elinor had affectionately expressed a with of being of me or comfort 
to her 
after half an hour’free indulgence of grief and norris am 
35 rejection catherine felt equal to encounter her friends 
but whether he should make her dinners known to them was another consideration 
perhaps if earned the might just have an idea just directly hint at it 
but not more 
not expose a friend such a friend as isabella hadbeento her 
and then their own brother go deeply concerned in it 
she believed the man wave the subject altogether 
henry and elinor were by themselves in the breakfast room 
and each ii she entered it looked at her anxiously 
catherine took her place at the table and after a short silence elinor said a no had new from fullest i hope

so soon but something has happened that would make itverydreadful for me to be in the lame housebut ca in tilney.” eleanors work was suspended while she passed with increasing astonishment 
but henry began to respect the truth and something in which in three name was included passed his lips 
a how trick you are 
a cried catherine 
a you have guessed it i declare 
and yet when we talked about it in bath 
you little thought of in ending so 
isabella 
no wonder new i have not heard from her 
isabella have deserted my brother and is to marry yours

i hope he he not had any material share in his long on mr norland dismay intent

i am very sorry for mr norland sorry that any one you love should be unhappy 
but my surprize would be greater at frederick marrying her than at any other part of the story it is very true however 
you shall read james letter yourself 
stay there is one part 
a recollecting with a blush the last line 
7 a will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother 
a 5 no read it yourself cried catherine whose second thoughts were clearer 
a i do not know what i wan thinking of blushing again that she had blushed before 
james only means to give me good advice he gladly received the letter

do not envy his duration either an a lover or a son miss silly at catherine invitation now read the letter likewise 
and having expressed also her concern and surprizes began to inquire into miss thorpe'a connexions fortune 
her mother is a very good sort of woman a wan catherine answer 
a what was her father 
a 7 a lawyer i believe 
they live at putney.” 1 are they a wealthy family 2 
no not very 
i do not believe isabella hat any fortune at all 
but that will not signify in your family 
your father ll no very liberal 
he told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the of hit children the brother and sister looked at each other 
a but a said elinor after a short pause would it be to promote his happiness to enable him to marry inch 3 girl 
she must be an unprincipled one or the could not have need your brother in 
and how manage an infatuation on frederick ride 
a who before his eyes it visiting an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man 
is not it inconceivable henry 2 frederick too who always wore his heart no medley who found no whom good enough to be in a that in the meet unpmmiﬁng circumstance the largest presumption against him 
when i think of his plan declarations i give him up 
moreover i have too good an opinion of mill three prudence to suppose that the would part with one gentleman before the other was secured 
it it all over with frederick indeed 
he in i decease man 
defect in understanding 
prepare for your sister-in-law eleanors 
and such i liner-in-iaw us you must delight in 
open candid mien guileless with affections strong but 38 northanger abbey 
simple forming no pretensions and knowing no disguise such a sister-in-law henry i should delight in a said elinor with a smile 
but perhaps a observed catherine though she has behaved so ill by our family she may behave better by yours 
now she has really got the man she likes she may be constantly 1 indeed i am afraid she will replied henry 
a i am afraid she will be very constant unless a bennets should come in her way 
that is frederick only chance 
i will get the bath paper and look over the arrival 1 you think it is all for ambition then 
and upon my word there are some things that seem very like it 
i can not forget that when she first knew what my father would do for them she seemed quite disappointed that 
it was not more 
i never was so deceived in any one character in my life before 
among all the great variety that you have known and studied 
a my own disappointment and loss in her is very get 
but as for poor james i suppose he will hardly ever recover is your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present 
but we must not in our concern for his sufferings made use yours 
you feel i suppose that in losing i la you lose half yourself you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy 
society is becoming irksome 
and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at bath the very idea of them without her is abhorrent 
you would not for instance now go to a ball for the world 
you feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve 
on whose regard you can place dependence 
or whose counsel in any difficulty you could rely on 
you feel all this 
northanger abbey 
39 into a said catherine after a few moments reflection i doubt ought i 
to by the truth though i am hurt and grieved that i can not will love her that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again i do not feel so very very much affected 3 one would have thought you feel as you always do was m is most to the credit of human nature 
such feelings ought to he investigated that they may know themselves catherine by some chance or other found her spirits so very much relieved by thin conversation that she could not regret her being led on though i unaccountably to mention the circumstance which had produced it 
hum 17 
from this time the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young people 
and catherine found with some surprize that her two young friends were perfectly agreed in considering itahella’l want of consequence and fortune as likely to throw great diﬂiculu'es in the way of her marrying theirbrother 
their persuasion that the general would upon this ground alone independent of the objection that might be raised against her character oppose the connexion turned her feeling 
moreover with some alarm towards herself 
she was at insignificant and perhaps ii portionless as isabella 
and if the heir of the gipsy property had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself at what point of interest were the demands of his younger brother to rest 
the very relations to which this thought led could only he by a dependence on the effect of that part partiality 
which an the was given to understand by his words as well as his actions 200 northanger abbey 
she had from the first been so fortunate as to excite in the general 
and by a recollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the subject of money which she had more than once heard him utter and which tempted her to think his disposition in such matters misunderstood by his children 
they were so fully convinced however that their brother would not have the courage to 1 play in person or his father's consent and so repeat assured her that be had never in his life been less likely to come to northanger than at the present time that she suffered her mind to be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of her own 
but as it was not to be supposed that captain tiled whenever he made his application would give his father any idea of isabella s conduct it occurred to her as highly expedient that henry should lay the whole business before him as it really was enabling the general by that means to form a cool and impartial opinion and pay his objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations 
she proposed it to him accordingly 
but he did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she had expected 
a no a said he 
my father's hands need not be strengthened and frederick confession of folly need not be forestalled 
he must tell his own story 
a but he will tell only half is a quarter would be enough 
a day or two passed away and brought no tidings of captain tiled 
his brother and sister knew not what to think 
sometimes it appeared to them as if his silence would be the natural result of the suspected engagement and at others that it was wholly income table with it 
the general mean while though i died every morning by frederick remissness in writing was free from any real anxiety about him 
and had no more pressing solicitude than that of making miss norland *** 
saw 
.jqéﬂ northangir abbey 
not time at norland or pleasant 
oftener refused his uneasiness ongthixphnad feared the sameness of 
every day s society and employment would disgust her with the place wished the lady fraser had been in the country talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancing people in the neighbourhood 
but then it was such a dead time of year no wild-fowl no game and the lady frame were not in the country anditallended stall in his telling henry one morning that when he next went 
to woman they would take him by surprize there some day or other and eat their mutton with him 
henry wan greatly honoured and very happy and catherine wan quite delighted with the scheme 
and when do you think air i may look forward to this pleasure 
i must be at woman on monday to attend the meeting and shall probably be obliged to my two or three 1 well well we will take our chance some one other day 
thereienoneedto ix 
you are not to put yourself at all out of your way 
whatever may happen to have in the house be enough 
think i can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor table 
let me see 
monday will be a busy day with you 
we will not come on monday 
and tuesday will be 1 buy one with me 
i expect my surveyor from wickham with his report in the morning 
and afterwards i can not in decency fail attending the club 
i really could not face my acquaintance if i mind away now 
for an i am known to be in the country it would be taken exceedingly mine 
and it is 1 rule with me miss morton never to give offence to any of my neighbour 
if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it 
they are a net of very worthy men 
they have half a quick from northanger twice a no you northanger abbey 
year 
and i dine with them whenever i can 
tuesday therefore we my my is out of the question 
but on wednesday i think henry you may expect us 
and we shall be with you early that we may have arm to look about us 
two hours and three-quarters will carry to woman i suppose 
we shall be in the carriage by ten 
so about a quarter before one on wednesday you may look for us a ball itself could not have been more welcome to catherine than this little excursion so strong was her desire to be as assisted with wood 
and her heart was still born g with joy when henry about an hour afterwards came boot and great-coat into the more where she and elinor were sitting and said i am come young ladies in a very moralising strain to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage giving ready-monied actual ha 
new for a draws on the future that may not be honoured witness myself at this present hour 
because i am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at woman on wednesday which bad weather or twenty other causes may prevent i must go away directly two days before i intended it go away a said catherine with a very long face 1 and why 
7 a why 
how can you ask the question 
because no name is to be lost in brightening my old housekeeper out of her with because i must go and prepare a dinner for you to be sure oh 
not seriously 
a ay and sadly too 
for i had much rather stay a but how can you think of such a thing after what the general said 
when he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble e because musing would do 
northanger abbey 
28th henry only smiled 
i am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister's account and mine 
you must know it to be so 
and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary 
besides if he had not said half so much as he did he has always much an excellent dinner at home that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify 
a i i wish i could reason like you for his sake and my own 
good-bye 
as to-morrow is sunday elinor i shall not return he went 
and it being at any time a much simple rational to catherine to doubt her own judgment than eyes she was very soon obliged to give him credit for being right however disagreeable to her his going 
but the inexplicability of the general conduct dwelt much on her thoughts 
that he was very particular in his eating she had by her own unassisted observation already discovered 
but why he should so one thing no positively and mean another all the w e was most unaccountable 
how were people at that rate to be understood 
who but henry could have been aware of what his father was at 
from saturday to wednesday however they were now to be without hen 
this was the sad sale of every reflection 
and spring tilney’s letter would certainly come in his absence and wednesday she was measure would jewel the st present and future were all equally in gloom 
her brother so unhappy and her loss in isabella so 
and eleanors spirits always affected by henry a absence 
what was there to interest or amuse her 
she was tired of the woods and the shrubberies always so smooth and so dry 
and the abbey in itself was no more to her now than any other house 
the painful remembrance of the folly it had helped to yours and perfect was the only emotion which could spring from s consideration 20 northanger abbey 
of the building 
what a revolution in her ideas 
she who had so longed to he in in abbey 
now there was nothing so charming to her imagination as the unpretending comfort of a well-connected parsonage something like fullest but better 
fullest had its faults but woods probably had none 
if wednesday should ever come 
it did come and exactly when it might be reasonably looked for 
it came 
it was one and catherine trod on air 
b ten o'clock the chaise-and-ibur conedthetwo matches and after e drive of almost twenty mdpégthey entered wmoodston a large and populous village in i situation not unpleasant catherine was ashamed to say how pretty shethoughtigathegeneralseernedwthinkan apology necessary for the names of the country and the size of village 
but in her heartache preferred to anyone she had ever beeoagand looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage and at all the little candles shops which they embody 
at the further end of the village and where lady disengaged from the rest of it stood the parsonage a well-built substantial stone house with its semi-circular my and green gates 
and as they drove up to the door henry with the friends of his solitude a large newfoundland spy and two or three tempers was ready to receive and make much of them 
catherine mind was too full as the entered the house for her either to observe or to lay a great deal 
and till called on by the general for her opinion of it she had very little idea of the room in which the was dining 
upon looking round it then she perceived in a moment that it was the most comfortable room in the world 
but she was too guarded to say no and the coldness of her praise disappointed him 
we are not calling it a good home said he 
northanger abbey 
-5 we are not comparing it with fullest and northanger 
we are considering it as a mere parsonage small and concerned we allow but decent perhaps and habitable 
and altogether not inferior to the generality 
or in other words i believe there are few country personages in england half so good 
it may admit of improvement however 
far be it from me to say otherwise 
and anything in reason 
s how thrown out perhaps 
though between ourselves if there is one thing more than another my aspersion it is a patched-up bow catherine did not hear enough of this speech us understand or he by it 
and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by henry at the same time that a my full of refreshments introduced his servant the general was shortly restored to his complacency and catherine to all her usual ease of spirits 
the room in question was of s commodious wellproportioned size and handsomely fitted up as a dining par our 
and on their quitting it to walk round the grounds she was shewn burst into a smaller apartment belonging peculiarly to the master of the house and made unusually tidy on the occasion 
and afterwards into win was to be the drawing-room with the appearance of which though furnished 
catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the general it was s prettily-sha room the windows reaching to the ground and e view from them pleasing though only over green meadows 
and she expressed her admiration at the moment with all the honest with which she felt it 
oh 
why do not you lit up this room mr tiled 
what i pity to have ﬁttedupl itisthepretdestroornleversswﬁtisthe prettiest room in the world 
i trust said the general with s most satisfied 26 non-ransom abbey 
smiles “thatitwillvuyqreedilybeﬁxminhcd waits only for a lady taste a well if it wan my house i should never it anywhere else 
oh what a sweet little cottage there in among the trees 
apple tree too 
it in the prettiest me it you like it you approve it as an object it ll enough 
henry remember that robinson is broken to about it 
the cottage remain 
such a compliment recalled catherine conaeioueneu and silenced her directly 
and though pointedly applied to by the game for her choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and changing nothing like an opinion on the subject could be drawn from her 
the influence of fresh object and fresh air however w of great we in dissipations these embracing associations and having reached the parental part of the promise consisting of a walk round two sides of a down on which henry genius had begun to act about half a year ago she was mﬂiciendy recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure-grounds she had ever been in before though there was not a stab in it higher than the green bench in the corner 
a winter into other meadows and through part of the village with a visit to the rules to examine some improvements and a charming game of play with a litter of puppies able to roll about 
brought them to four o'clock when catherine scarcely thought it would be three 
at four they were to dine and at six to set or 
on their return 
never had any day passed so quickly 
she could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem to create the smallest anoniihmen in the general 
nay that he was even looking at the ride 
table for cold meat which was not there 
his son and daughters observations were of a different kind 
they had seldom seen him eat no heartily at any able northanger abbey 
2 -5 but his own 
and never before known him so little bias conceited by the rested butter being ailed 
at six o'clock the general having taken his coffee the carriage again received them 
and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct throughout the whole visit to well natured wan her mind on the subject of his expectations that could the have felt equally confident of the wishes of hiding catherine would have quitted woods with little anxiety at to the how or the when the might return to it

a catherine was listened out of further bitterness frederick d not be in bath guilty while henry made himself so agree e. she resolved on not answering intellect letter and tried to think no more of it 
hum 1785 
on am this the general found himself obliged to go to london for a week 
and he left boulanger earnestly regretting that any necessity would rob him even for an hour of mill morlaud’e company and anxious recommending the study of her comfort and amusement to his children a their chief object in his absence 
his departure gave catherine the list experiment conviction that a loss may be sometimes a gun 
the happiness with which their time now passed every employment voluntary every laugh indulged every meal a scene of ease and good-humour walking where they liked and when they liked their hours pleasures and fatigue at their own come 
and made her thoroughly smile of the remains which the general presence had improved and most thankfully feel their present release from it 
such ease and such delights made her love the place and the 2 i 2 northanger abbey 
peoplemoreandmoreeveryday 
and had issue been for a dread of in no becoming expedient to leave the one and an apprehension of not being equally beloved by the other the would at each moment of each hay have been perfectly happy 
but the war now in the fourth week of her visit 
before the general came home the fourth week would be turned 
and perhaps it might see an intrusion if she inasmuch longer 
thin was a painful consideration whenever it occurred 
and eager to get rid of such a weight on her mind the very soon resolved to speak no elegance about it at once propose going away and be guided in her conduct by the mannerin which her proposal might be taken 
aware that if the game herself much time the might feel it difficult to bring forward so unpleasant a subject she took the list maturity of being suddenly alone with elinor and eleanors being in the middle of a speech about something verydiﬁerengto start forth her obligation of going away very soon 
elinor looked and declared herself much concerned 
she had a hoped for the pleasure of her company for a much longer time 
had been misled perhaps by her wishes to suppose that a much longer visit had been proposed and could not but think that if mr and mrs world were aware of the pleasure was to have her there they would be too generous to harden her return catherine explained

the kindness the earnestness of eleanors manner in pressing her to my and henry gratified look on being told that her my was determined were such sweet proof of her importance with them a left her only just so much solicitude up the human mind can never do comfortably without 
she did almost always believe that henry loved her and quite aware that hit father and litter loved and even wicked hero belong to them 
and believing to far her doubt and mxieu'el were merely sportive irritation henry was not able to oheyhit father's injunction of remaining wholly at northanger in attendance on the ladies during his absence in london 
the engagement of hit counteract woods liking him to leave them onsamrdayforaooupleof nights 
his lot war not now what it had been while the general was at home 
it branched their gaiety but did not in their comfort 
and the two girls agreeing in occupation and improving in intimacy found there so well-mlﬁcient for the time to themselves that it wan eleven o'clock rather i late hour at the before they quitted the room on the day of henry they ha just reached the head the stain when it seemed far a the richness of the wall 
would allow them to judge that a carriage was driving up to the door and the next momentoonﬁmedtheideahytheloudnoiseofthe household 
after the hint perturbation of surprize had passed away in a 
good heaven 
what can he the matter 
it war quickly decided by elinor to be her eldest brother whose arrival wan often an redden if not quite to unreasonable and accordingly the hurried down to welcome him 
2 14 northanger abbey 
catherine walked on to her chamber making up her mind as well as she could to a further acquaintance with captain finery and comfort herself under the unpleasant impression his conduct had her and the persuasion of his being by far too line a gentleman approve of her that at least they should not meet under such circumstances as would make their meeting materially painful 
she trusted he would never speak of miss shot and indeed as he must by this time be ashamed of the part he had acted there could he no danger of it 
and as long as all mention of bath scenes were avoided she thought she could behave to him very civilly 
in such considerations time passed away and it was certainly in his favour that elinor should he so glad to see him and have so much to say for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival and elinor did not come up 
at that moment catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery and listened for its continuance but all was silent 
scarcely however had she convinced her fancy of error when the noise of something moving close to her door made her start 
it seemed as if some one was touching the very doorway and in another moment a slight motion of the lock proved that some hand must he on it 
she trembled a little at the idea of anyone approaching so cautiously but resolving not to be again overcome by trivial appearances of alarm or misled by a raised imagination she stepped quietly forward and opened the door 
elinor and only elinor stood there 
catherine spirits however were tranquillized but for an instant for eleanors cheeks were pale and her manner greatly agitated 
though evidently intending to come in it seemed an effort to enter the room and a still greater to speak when there 
catherine supposing some uneasiness on captain tilney’s account could only express her concern by -5 -5 
how northanger abbey 
3 i 5 silent attention obliged her to be seated rubbed her temples with lavender water and hung over her with aﬁ'ecu'onate solicitude

i come to you on such an errand

a show dismal telling

7 a you are mistaken indeed a formed elinor looking at her most compassionate 
it is no one from woods 
it is my father himself 
her voice faltered andhereyesweremmdtothegroundas she mentioned his name 
his unlooked-for return was enough in itself to make catherine heart sink and for a few moments sharply supposed there were any thing worse to he told 
she aid nothing 
and elinor endeavouring to collect herself and speak with firmness but with eyes sup ll cut down soon went on 
a you are too good i am sure to think the worse of me for the part i am obliged to perform 
i am indeed a most unwilling messenger 
after what has so lately passed so lately been settled between us how joyfully how thankfully on my side 
as to your continuing here as i hoped for many many weeks longer how can i tell you that your kindness is not to he accepted and that the happiness your company hitherto given us is to be repaid by butimustnottmstmyselfwithwords

but how can i tell you 
to-morrow morning is fixed for your leaving us and not even the hour is left to your choice 
the very carriage is ordered 
and will be here at seven o'clock and no servant will be offered you catherine sat down breathless and speechless 
i could hardly believe my senses when i heard it 
and no displeasure no resentment that you can feel at this moment however justly great can he more than i my

but i must not talk of what i felt 
oh that i northangbr abbey

it was the last thing i would willingly have done

i am only try it was not recollected manner that i might have written home 
but it in of very little oonaequence.” i hope i mostly hope that to your real safety it will he of none 
but to everything else it in of the great consequence 
to comfort appearance propriety to your family to the world 
were your friends the fallen in bath you might go to them with comparative ease 
a few hours would take you up 18 noun-tween sunny

but a journey of seventy miles to be taken post by you at your age alone unattended 
a 14 oh 
this is nothing 
do not think about that 
and a we are to part a fey/hours sooner or later you know makes no difference 
i can be ready by seven 
let me be called in time elinor saw that she wished to be alone 
and believing it better for each that they should avoid any farther conversation now left her with a i shall see you in the morning catherine swelling heart needed relief 
in eleanors presence friendship and pride had equally restrained her tears but no sooner was she gone than they burst forth in torrent 
turned from the house and in such a walk without any reason that could justify any apology that could atone for the abruptness the rudeness nay the insolence of it 
henry at a distance 
not able even to bid him farewell 
every hope every expectation from him suspended at least and who could say how long 
who could say when they might meet again 
and all this by such a man as general time so polite so well-bred and heretofore so particularly fond of her 
it was as incomprehensible as it was mortifying and grievous 
from what it could arise and where it would end were considerations of equal perplexity and alarm 
the manner in which it was done so grossly uncivil hurrying her away without any reference to her own convenience or allowing her even the appearance of choice as to the time or mode of her travelling 
of two days the earliest fixed on and of that almost the earliest hour as if resolved to have her he before he was stirring in the morning that he might not be obliged even to see her 
what could all this mean but an intention affront 
by some means or other she must have had the misfortune to defend him 
elinor had wished to spare her from so painful a notion but catherine could not believe it possible that northanger abbey 
2 i 9 any injury or any misfortune could provoke such ill-will against a person not connected or at least not supposed to be connected with it 
heavily passed the night sleep or repose that deserved the name of sleep was out of the question 
that tom in which her disturbed imagination had tormented her on her first arrival we again the scene of agitated spirits and quiet slumber 
yet how different now the source of her inquietude from what it had been then 
how mournful superior in reality and substance 
her anxiety had foundation in fact her fears in probability 
and with a mind so occupied in the contemplation of actual and natural evil the solitude of her situation the darkness of her chamber the activity of the building were felt and considered without the smallest emotion and though the wind was high and often produced strange and sudden noises throughout the house she heard it all as she lay awake hour after hour without curiosity or terror 
soon after six eleanors entered her room eager to show attention or give assistance where it possible 
but very little remained to be done 
catherine had not loitered 
she was almost dressed and her packing almost wished 
the possibility of some conciliatory message from the general occurred to her as his daughter appeared 
what so natural as that anger should pass away and repentance succeed it 
and she only wanted to know how far after what had an apology might properly be received by her 
at the knowledge would have been useless here it was not called for 
neither clemency nor dignity was put to the trial 
elinor brought no message 
very little passed between them on meeting each found her greatest in silence 
and few and trivial were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs 
catherine in busy agitation completing her dress and elinor with more good-will du experience intent upon filling the 22nd nortkanger abbey 
trunk 
when everything was done they left the room catherine lingering only half minute behind her friend to throw a parting glance on every well-known cherished and went down to the breakfast-parlour where breakfast wan prepared 
she tied to eat swell to cave herself from the pain of being urged as to make her friend comfortable 
but she had no appear and could not swallow many mouthfuls 
the contrast between thieandherlastbreakfastin that room gave her fresh misery and strengthened her distaste for everything before her 
it wan not four-and-twenty hours ago since theyhadmthemmthemempambutin circumstances how different 
with what cheerful use what happy though false security had she then looked around her enjoying everything present and fearing little in future beyond henry going to woman for a day 
happy happy breaks 
for henry had been there 
henry had sat by her and helped her 
these reflections were long indulged undisturbed by any address from her companion who eat as deep in thought as herself 
the appearance of the carriage was the first thing to startle and recall them to the recent moment 
catherine colour rose at the sight it 
and indignity with which she was treated striking at that instant on her mind with peculiar force made her for a short time sensible only of resentment 
elinor seemed now impelled into resolution and speech 
a you my 
write to me catherine 1 she cried 
a you must let me hear from you as soon as possible 
till i know you to be safe at home i shall not have an hour's comfort formlemrataumauhawngmu-t entreat 
let me have the ntinﬁcﬁon of knowing that you are safe at fullest and have found your family well 
and then till i can ask for your cork absence as i ought to do i will not expect more 
directly to me at lord longings and i must ask it under cover to slice northanger abbey 
22 no elinor if you are not allowed to receive aylmers ﬁnmmlammreihadbemrnotwrite 
there can be no doubt of my getting home safe elinor only replied i can not wonder at your feelings 
i will not importune you 
i will trust to your own kindness of heart when i am at a distance from you 
but this with the look of sorrow accompanying it was enough to meet catherine pride in a moment and she instantly said a oh 
elinor i will write to you indeed 
a there was yet another point which miss time was anxious to settle though somewhat embarrassed in speaking of 
that occurred to her that after so long an absence from home catherine might not be provided with money enough for the expenses of her journey and upon suggesting it to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation it proved to he exactly the case 
catherine had never thought on the subject till that moment 
but upon examining her purse was come since that but for this kindness of her friend she might have been turned form the house without even the means of getting home 
and the distress in which she must have been thereby involved filling the minds of both warmer another word was said by either during the time of their remaining together 
short however was that time 
the carriage was soon announced to be ready 
and catherine instantly rising along and affectionate embrace supplied the b race of language in bidding each other adieu 
and so they entered the hall unable to leave the house without some mention of one whose name had not yet been spoken by either she paused a moment and with quivering lips just made it intelligible that she left her kind remembrance for her absent friends but with this approach to his name ended all possibility of remaining her feelings 
and hiding her say northanger abbey 
face as well as she could with her handkerchief she darted across the hall jumped into the chaise and in a moment was driven from the door 
chasm it 
catherine was too wretched to be fearful 
the journey itself had no terrors for her 
and she began it without either dreading its length or feeling its solitariness 
leaning back in one corner of the carriage in a violent burst tears she was conveyed some miles beyond the walls of the abbey before she raised her head 
and the higher point of ground within the park was almost closed from her view before she was capable of turning her eyes towards it 
unfommately the road she now travelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily passed along in going to and from woods 
and for fourteen miles every bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects on which she had hurst looked under impressions so different 
every mile as it brought her nearer weston added to her sufferings 
and when within the distance of live she passed the turning which led to it and thought of dry so near yet so unconscious her grief and agitation were excessive 
the day which she had not at that place had been one of the happy less of her life 
t weathered it was on that day that the general had made use of such expressions with regard to henry and herself had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage 
yes only ten days ago had he wished her by his pointed regard 
had he even confused her by his too significant reference 
and now what had the done or what had she omitted to do to merit such a change 
nothing abbey 
2 2 3 the only offence against him of which she could accuse herself had been such as was scarcely possible to reach his knowledge 
henry and her own heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly entertained 
and yet safe did she believe her secret with each 
dear yes at least henry could not have betrayed her 
f indeed by any arrange mischance his father should have gained intelligence of what she had dared to think and look for of her candles fancies and injurious explanations she could not wonder-stony degrees his indignation 
if aware of her having viewed him as a sufferer she could not wonder at his even turning her from his house 
but a justification so full of torture to herself she rated would not be in his power 
anxious as were all her conjectures on this into it was not however the one on which she dwelt most 
there was a thought yet nearer 
a more prevailing more impetuous concern 
how henry would think and feel and look when he returned on the morrow or northanger andheardof herbeing gone was a question of force and interest to rise of every other to he never-ending alternately imitations and soothing it sometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence and at other was answered by the sweetest confidence in his regretting resentment 
to the general of course he would not dare to 
but to elinor what might he not say no elinor shoot her 
in this pleasing recurrence of double and inquiries on any one article of which her mind was incapable of more than momentary repose the hours passed away and her journey advanced much faster than she looked for 
the pressing anxieties of thought which proved her from noticing anything before her when once beyond the neighbourhood of woods saved her at the same time from watching her progress 
and though no object 24 northanger abbey 
on the road could engage a moment's attention she found no stage of it tedious 
from this she was preserved too by another cause 
by feeling no eagerness for her journey conclusion 
for to return in such a manner to fullest was almost to destroy the pleasure of a meeting with those she loved best even s an absence such as hers an elder weeks absence 
what had she to say that would not humble herself and pain her family 
that would not increase her own grief by the confession of it 
extend an useless resentment and perhaps involve the innocent with the guilty in undistinguishing ill-will 
she could never do justice to henry and eleanors merit she felt it too strongly for expression and should a dislike be taken against them should they be thought of unfavourably on their fathers account it would cut her to the heart 
with these feelings she rather dreaded than sought for the first view of that well-known spire which would announce her within twenty miles of home 
salisbury she had known to be her point on leaving northanger but after the first stage she had been indebted to the post-masters for the names of the places which were then to conduct her to it 
so great had been her ignorance of her route 
she met with nothing however to distress or frighten her 
her youth civil manners and liberal pay procured her all the attention that a traveller like herself could require 
and stopping only to change horses she travelled on for about eleven hours without accident or alarm and between six and seven o'clock in the evening found herself entering fullest 
a heroine returning at the close of her career to her native village in all the triumph of recovered repetition and all the dignity of a countless with a long train of noble relations in their several phaeton and three waiting-maids in a travelling chaise-and~four behind northangir abbey

it gives credit to every conclusion and the author must share in the glory she so liberally bestowed 
but my affair is widely different i bringbsckrnyheroine to her home in solitude and disgrace and no sweet claim of spirits can lad me into minuteness 
a heroine in a hack post-chaise is studied a blown sentiment as no attanptat grandeur or paths can withstand 
swiftly therefore shall her post-boys drive through the village amid the gaze of sunday cups and speedy shall be her descent from it 
but whatever might be the times of catherine mind as she thus advanced towards the parsonage and whatever the humiliation of her biographer relating it she was preparing enjoyment of no every-day nature for those to whom she went 
first in the appearance of her carriage and secondly in herself 
the chaise of a traveller being a rare sight in fullest the whole family were immediately at the window

a my dear you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble 1 said her mother at last

but now it in all over perhaps there in no harm done 
it is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves 
you know my dear catherine you always were a sad little rhatter-brained creature but now you must have been forced to have your writes about you with so much changing of choice and so forth 
and i hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets 
catherine hoped so no andtriedto feelanintereat in her own amendment but her spirits were quite worn down 
and to be silent and alone becoming noon her only wish she readily agreed to her mother's next counsel of going early to bed 
her parents seeing nothing in her ill-luck and agitation but the natural consequence of married feelings and of the unusual exertion and fatigue of such a journey 
parted from her without any doubt of their being noon kept away 
and though when they all met the next morning her recovery war not equal to their hopes they were mild perfectly unsuspicious of there being any deeper evil 
they never once thought of her heart which for the parley of a young lady of seventeen just returned from her first excursion from home war odd enough 
28th northanger sum

for already did catherine reproach herself with having parted from elinor coldly 
with having never enough ruled her merit or kindness 
and never enoughoommiseratedherforwbatshehadheenymr 
day left to endure 
the strength of these feelings however was far from assisting her pen 
and never had it been harder for her to write than in addressing eleanors tiled 
to compose a letter which might at once do justice to her sentiments and her situation convey gratitude without sense regret be guarded without coldness and home without resentment 
a letterwhich elinor might not be b the of 
and above all which she might blush week if henry should chance to see was an union to frighten away all her powers of performance 
and after long thought and much perplexity to be very brief was all that she could determine on with any confidence of safety 
the money therefore which elinor had advanced was enclosed with little more than grateful thanks and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate heart

catherine took no quite by surprize yesterday evening said she

her avocaﬁons above having shut out all noise but what she created herself she knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few minutes till on entering the room the first object she beheld was a 
g man whom she had never seen before 
with a m of much respect he immediately rose and being introduced to her by her conscious daughter as a mr henry tinged with the embarrassment of real sensibility began to apologise for his appearance there acknowledging that after what had passed he had little right to expect a welcome at fullest and stating impatience to be assured of miss norland having reached her home in safety as the cause of his intrusion 
did not address himself a an us candidjudge or a resentful heart 
far from compress bending him or his sister in their fathers misconduct mrs norland had been always kindly disposed towards each 
and instantly pleased by his appearance received him with the simple professions of unaffected benevolence 
thanking him for such an attention to her daughter 
assuring him that the friends of her children were always welcome there and treating him to say not another word of the past 
he was not ill inclined to obey this request

they began their walk and mrs norland wan not entirely quicken in his object in wishing it 
some explanation on hiefnther’eaccounthehad forgive 
but hieﬁrutpurpone wan to explain himself 
and before they reached 36 northanger abbey 
mr allies s grounds he had done it in well that catherine did not think it could ever be repeated too often 
she was assured of his affection 
and that heart in return was solicitude which perhaps they pretty equally knew was already entirely his own 
for though henry was now sincerely attached to her 
— though he felt and delighted in all the excellencies of her character and trulyloved her society 
i must confess that his affection originated in nothing better than gratitude 
or in other words thataperxnasionofherpanialityforhhn hadbeenthe only cause of giving her a serious thought 
it is a new circumstance in romance i acknowledge and dreadfully derogatory of an heroine dignity 
but if it be as new in common life the credit of a wild imagination will at least be all my own 
a very short visit to mrs fallen in which henry talked at random without sense or connection and catherine wrapt in the contemplation of her own unutterable happiness scarcely opened her dismissed them to the easiest of another tétc-h-téte 
and before it was suffered to close she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority in his present application 
on his return from woods two days before he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father hastily informed in angry terms of miss norland departure and ordered to think of her no more 
such was the permission s which he had now offered her his hand 
the alighted catherine amidst all the tremors of expectation as she listened to this account could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious rejection by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject 
and as he proceeded to give the particulars and explain the motives of his father s conduct her soon hardened into even a triumphant delight 
the general had had nothing to accuse her of nothing to nonrmxcnn abbey 
37 lay to her charge but her being the involuntary unconscious object of a deed on which his pride could not pardon and which a pride would have been ashamed to own 
she was guilty only of being less rich than he had supposed her to be 
unless taken persuasion of her possessions and he had courted her acquaintance in bath solicited her company at northanger and designed her for his daughter-in-law 
on discovering his error to turn her from the house seemed the best though to his feelings an inadequate proof of his resentment towards herself and his consent of her family 
on there had first misled him 
the general perceiving his son one night at the theatre to be paying considerable mention to miss norland had accidentally inquired of hope if he knew more of her than her name 
the most ha ay to be on speaking terms with a man of general lucy s importance had hem joyfully and proudly communicative 
and being at that time not only in daily expectation of norland engaging isabella but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying catherine himself his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them 
with whomsoever he was or was likely to be connected his own consequence always required thatthein should he got 
and as his intimacy with any acquaintance grew la ye grew their four 
the expectations of his friend norland therefore from the hint over-rated had ever since his introduction to isabella been gradually increasing 
and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment by doubting what he chose to think the amount of mr norland preferment treating his private fortune bestowing a rich aunt and sinking half the children he was able to represent the whole family to the general in a most respectable light 
2 38 non-mama abbey 
for catherine however the peculiar object or the general curiosity and his own speculations he had yet something more in reserve 
and the ten or after thousand pounds which her father could give her would he a pretty addition to mr allies s estate 
her intimacy there had made him seriously determine on her being handsomely legacies hereafter 
and to speak of her therefore as the almost acknowledged future niece of fullest naturally followed 
upon such intelligence the general had proceeded for never had it occurred to him to doubt its authority 
hopes interest in the family by his sisters approaching connection with one of in moment and his own views on another of which he boasted with almost equal openness seemed sufficient vouches for his truth 
and to these were added the absolute facts of the olivers being wealthy and children of miss norland being under their care and as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge of their thinking her with parental kindness 
his resolution was soon formed 
already had he discerned a liking towards miss norland in the countenance of hit son 
and thankful for mr hopes communication he almost instantly determined to spare no pains in turning his boasted interest and rising his dearest hopes 
catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all this than his own children 
henry and elinor perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their fathers clara respect had seen with astonishment the an entree continuance and extent of his attention 
and though latterly from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in power to attach her henry was convinced of his father's believing it to be an advantageous connection it was not till the be explanation at northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculation 
which had hurried northanger anna 
39 him on 
that they were false the general had learned from the very person who had suggested them from there himself whom he had chanced to meet again in town 
and who under the influence of exactly opposite feelings irritated by catherine rears and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accept fish a reconciliation between norland and isabella convinced that they were for ever and spending a friendship which so d be no longer serviceable happened to contradict all that he had laid before to the advantage of the norland confused himself have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father fun of absence and credit whereas the action

the married general pronounced the name of allied with an inquiring look 
and here too there had learnt his error 
the artless he believed had lived farther too long and he knew the young man on whom the fullest ease must involve

henry in having such things to relate of his father was almost an pitiable as in their first avowed to him he blushed for the narrow-minded counsel which he was obliged to expose 
the conversation between them at boulanger had been the mostunfriendly kind 
henry indignation on hearing how catherine had been treated on comprehending his father s views and being ordered to acquiesce in them had been open and hold 
the general accustomed on every ordinary occasion to give the love in his family prepared for no reluctance but of a feeling no desire that should dare to clothe itself in words can d ill brook the opposition of his son ready as the sanction of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it 
but in such a cause his anger though it must shock could not intimidate henry who was detained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice 
he felt himself bound as much in honour as in affection to miss morton and believing that hurt to be his own which he had been directed to gain no unworthy restrictions of a tacit consent no recovering decree of unjustifiable anger could shake his quality or indulgence the resolution it prompted 
he steadily resigned to accompany his father into hertfordshire an engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the disposal of catherine and as northanglk abbey 
24 l steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand 
the general was opinions in his anger and they parted in dreadful disagreement 
henry in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours were required to compose had returned almost instantly to wonder 
and on the afternoon of the following day had begun his journey to fullest 
hum iii 
s and mr norland surprise on being applied to by mr time for their consent to hit marrying their daughter was for a few minutes considerable 
it having never entered their heads to expect an attachment on either side 
but as nothing after all could be more natural than catherine being beloved they soon learnt to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratitude pride 
and as far as they alone were concerned had not a single objection to start 
his pleasing manner and good sense were evident recommendation 
and having never heard evil of him it was not their way to oppose any evil could he told 
good-will supplying the place of experience his character needed no agitation 
catherine would make a sad heedless young housekeeper to be sure a wan her mother foreboding remark 
but quick wit the consolation of there being nothing like practice 
there was but one obstacle in short to be mentioned 
but till that one was removed it must be impossible for them to uncommon the engagement 
their tempers were mild but their principals were steady 
and while parent no expense forbad the connexion they could not allow vexed to encourage it 
that the general should come forward in solicited the 24th northanger abbey 
alliance or that he should even very hastily approve it they were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation but the decent appearance of consent must be yielded and that once obtained and their own hearts made them must that it could not be very long denied their willing approbation was instantly to follow 
his count was all that they wished for 
they were no more inclined than entitled to demand his money 
of a very considerable fortune his son was by marriage settlement eventually secure 
his recent income was an income of independence and c on and under every pecuniary view it was a match beyond the claims of their daughter 
the young people could not be surprized at a decision like this 
they 
felt and they deplored but they could not resent it 
and they parted endeavouring to hope that such a change in the general as each believed almost in sensible might yet take c. to unite them again in the fullness of privileged aﬂecﬁou 
henry returned to what was now his only home to watch over his young plantations and extend his improvements for her sake to whose share in them he looked anxiously forward 
and catherine remained at fullest to cry 
whether the contents of absence were softened by a clandestine correspondence let us not inquire 
mr and mr norland never did 
they had been too kind to exact any promise and whenever catherine received a letter as at that time happened pretty often they always looked another way 
the anxiety which in this state of their attachment must be the portion of henry and catherine and of all who loved either as no its usual event can hardly extend

by which their early marriage was effected can be the only doubt what probable circumstance could work upon a temper like the general 
the circumstance which cried availed was the 
marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence which tookplace in the more of the summer anacoeuion ofdignitythat threw him into a at good-humour from which he did not recover till after elinor bad obtainedhiefo .veneaeofh and insolent for him

collection of walking-bills willing from a long visit at northanger by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventure 
the influence of the viscount and discontents in their brother s behalf was assisted by that right understanding of mr norland circummncea which as soon as the general would allow himself to be informed tbeywere ualiliedtogive
