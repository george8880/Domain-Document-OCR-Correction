o one who had ever seen catherine normandy in her infancy would have supposed her born to he an heroine 
her situation in life the character of her father and mother her own person and disquisition were all equally against her 
her father was a clergyman without being neglected or r and a very respectable man though his name wan charily and he had never been handsome 
he had a considerable independence besides two good likings and he was not in the least addicted to locking n his daughters 
her mother wan a woman of useful p n sense with a good temper and what is more remarkable with a good constitution 
she had three sons before catherine was born 
and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world as any body might expect she still lived on 
lived to have six children more 
to see them growing up around her and to enjoy excellent health herself 
a family often children will be always called a fine family where there are heads and arms and enough for the number 
but the morlocks had iii other right to the word for they were in general very plain and catherine for many years of her life as plain as any 
she had i thin awkward sure i allow skin 2 norther abbey 
without colour dark lank hair and wrong features 
so much for her person and not less unptopitionl for heroism seemed her mind 
she was fond of all a gay and greatly preferred cricket not merely to do is t to the more heroic enjoyment of infancy nursing a dormouse feeding a canary-bird or watering a roses 
indeed the had no taste for a garden and if she flowers at all it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief at least no it was conjectured from her always referring those which the wan forbidden to rake 
such were her propensities 
her were quite as exuaordina 
she never could learn or understand anything before she was taught and sometimes not even then for the was often inattentive and occasionally stuff sid 
her mother was three months in teaching her on y to repeat the e beggarly petition c and after all her next sister sally could say it hem than she did 
not that catherine was always l insipid 
by no means 
she learnt the table of 4 the are and many friends as quickly as my girl in england 
her otherwise her to learn music 
and catherine was sure she should like it for she was very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spine so at eight years old she an 
she learnt a year and could not bear it 
and mrs moran who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in spite of incapacity or dispute allowed her to leave of 
the day which divided the musician was one of the of catherine s life 
her taste for drawing war not superior 
though whenever she could obtain the outside a later from brother or since upon any other odd piece of paper she did what she could in that way by drawing homes and trees hens and chickens all very much like one another 
writing and account she was taught by her father 
french by her mother 
her pungency in either was not remarkable and are shield her lawns in both norther abbey 
3 whenever she could 
what a strange maceountahle character 
for with all these symptoms of privacy at ten years old she had neither a bad heart debar a had temper was seldom sambhur scared ever quarreloome and very kind to the little ones with interruptions of tyranny 
she was moreover noisy and wild hated confinement and cleanliness and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house 
such was catherine marked at ten 
at fifteen appearancesweremending 
she began to curlherhair and long for balls her complexion improved her whites were softened by plumpness and colour her eyes gained more animation and i her figure more consequence 
her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for only and she grew clean as she grew smart 
she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her usual in reverent 
a catherine grows quite a good-looking girl 
she is almost pretty to-day a were words which caught her can now and then 
and how welcome were the sounds 
to look alarm p is an acquisition of higher delight to a girl who hat looking plain the rest after yearn of her life than a beauty from her cradle can ever receive 
mrs mainland was a very good woman and wished to see her children everything they ought to be but her time was so much occur ned in lying-in and teaching the little ones that her eh er daughters were inevitably left to shift for themselves 
and it was not very wonderful that catherine who had by nature nothing heroic about her should prefer cricket hate ball riding on horns back and running about the county at the age of fourteen to books or at least books information in provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be gained from then provided they were all marry and no

reflection she had never any objection to books at all 
but from fifteen to seventeen she was in calling for a heroine 
she food all such works as heroes must read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so serviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives 
from pope she lam to ensure those who d bar shout the mockery of women from gray that i'mmysﬂmi-borntohlushumem and “sultfngrlneeontheduen air from those that g. it is s delightful ask to lush the young idea how to me from shakspeomshegainedsgrwmofinformation amongst the rest that

folks patience on a monument smiling a grief 
so far her improvement was sufficient and in my other points she came on exceedingly well 
for though he could not write bonnets she brought herself to read them 
and though there seemed no chance of her throwing a whole party into rupture by a prelude on the piano-forte of her own composition she could listen to norther abbey 
s other people performance with very little fatigue 
her greatest deficiency was in the pencil 
the had no notion of drawing 
not enough even to attempt a wretch of her lover s people that the might be detected in the design 
there she fell miserably thorn of the true heroic height 
at present she did not know her own poverty for she had no lover to pray 
she had reached the age of eaten without having seen one amiable youth who could call forth her senility without having inspired one real passion and without having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate and very transient 
this was strange indeed 
but strange things may be generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out 
there was not one lord in the neighbourhood 
no not even a manner 
there wan not one family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boy accidentally found at their door 
not one young man whose was unknown

something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way 
mr allen who owned the chief of the property about fuller the village in fifeshire where the veranda lived was ordered to bath for the benefit of a gusty constitution 
and hii_lady a good-humoured woman fond of miss moran and probably aware that if adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village the mute seek them abroad invited her to go with them

it ll remarkable however that the neither insisted on catherine wrong by every poet nor exacted her promise of transmitted the character of every new acquaintance nor a detail of every interesting convention that 
bath might produce 
everything indeed relative to thin important journey we done on the part of the morlocks with a degree of moderation and composure which seemed rather month with the common feelings of common life than with the refined sincepdbilitiet 
the tender emotion which the first separation of a heroine from her family ought always to excite 
her father instead of giving her an unlimited order on hibanlter or even putting an hundred pounds ant-hill into her hands gave her only ten guinea and promised her more when she wanted it 
under these unpromising auspices the parting took place and the journey began 
it wan reformed with suitable quiet and eventful safety 
either robber nor term em befriended them nor one lucky venture to it use them to the hero 
nothing more alarming occurred than a fear on my allen s side of having once left her close behind her at an inn and that fortunately proved to be friendless

it is now expedient to give some description of mrs allen that the reader my be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter tend to provoke the general distress of the work and how the will probably contribute to reduce poor catherine to all the desperate wretchedness of which a last volume is capable 
whether by her imprudence vulgar or jealousy 
whether by intercepting her letters ruining her r or turning her out of doors 
mrs allen was one of thatnumemosdau of females whose society can raise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the world who could like them well enough to marrythem 
she ll neither beauty genius accomplishment nor manner 
the air of a gentlewornan a great deal of quiet inactive good temper and a trifling turn of mind were all that could account for her being the choice of a sensible intelligent man like mr allen 
in one respect he was admirably attend to introduce a young lady into public being as fond of going everywhere and seeing everything herself as any young lady could he 
dress was her passion 
she had a most harmless delighting being one 
and our heroine entry into life could not take place till after three or four days had been spent in leaning what was mostly worn and her apron was provided with a dress of the west fashion 
catherine too niadeaomepurchaaesherself andwhenallthese matters were arranged the important evening came which was to shere her into the upper rooms 
her hair was cut and dressed by the best hand her clothes put on with care and both mrs allen and her maid declared she looked nice as she should do 
with such encouragement theorize hoped at lean to pass uncontorted through the crowd 
as for admiration it was always very welcome when it came but she did not depend on it

9 mrs allen was so long in dreaming that they did not enter the ball-room till late 
the sewn was full the room crowded and the two ladies squeezed in well as they could 
as for mr allen he repaired directly to the court-room and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves 
with more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of her protested mrs allen made her way through the throng of men by the door as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow 
catherine however lent close at her side and linked her arm too timid within her friends to beware asunder by any common effort of a struggling assembly 
but to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along the more was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd 
it seemed rather to intense as they went on 
whereas she had imagined that when once fairly within the door they should easily seats and be able to watch the dances with perfect convention 
but thin was far from being the case 
and though by unwearied diligence they gained even the top of the room their situation was just the same they saw nothing of the dancers but the high feathers of come of ill ladies 
still they moved on something better was yet in view 
and by a continued exertion of strength and ingenuity they found themselves at last in the passage behind the highest bench 
here there was something less of crowd than below 
and hence miss morlandhad a cow retentive view of all the company beneath her i and n all the dangers of her late get through them 
a it was a splendid sight 
and she gain for the ﬁrsttime 2 that evening to feel herself at a hall she longed to i dance but she had not an act instance in the room 
v men allen did all that she co d do in such a clue by lying very placidly every now and then a i wish you dance my dear 
i wish on could get pinner 10 for some time her young friend felt obliged to her for 25 ... 
he l i o norther abbey 
these wishes but they were re acted so often and raved so totally ineffectual that catherine grew tired at last and would thank her no more 
they were not long able however to enjoy the repose of the eminence they had so laboriously gained 
everybody was shortly in motion for ten and they must squeezed out like the rest 
catherine 1100 to feel something of disappointment she was tired of being continually pressed against by people the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to interest and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that should not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a syllable with any of her fellows eves 
and when at last arrived in the teaspoon she eft yet more the awkwardness of having no party to join no acquaintance to claim no gentleman to assist them 
they aw nothing of mr allen 
and after looking about them in vain for a more eligible situation were obliged to sit down at the end of a table at which a large party were already placed without having anything to do there or anybody to speak to except each other 
mrs allen congratulated herself as soon as they were seated on having preserved her gown from injury 
it would have been very shocking to have it tom a said she 
would not it 
it is such a delicate muslin 
for my part i have not seen anything i like so well in the whole room i assure you 
a how uncomfortable it is whispered a not to have a single acquaintance here 
b c yes my dear replied mrs allen with perfect serene a it is very uncomfortable indeed a hat shall we do 
the gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here 
we seem forcing ourselves into their 
eye so we do 
that is very feeble 
i wish we had a large acquaintance here catherine norteanger abbey

the kindness were here last year 
i wish they were here now had not we better away as it in 
tea-things for us you see no more there are indeed 
how very provoking 
but i think we had better sit still for one gets ambled in such a crowd 
how in my head my dear 
somebody gave me a push that has hurt it i am afraid not indeed it looks very nice 
but dear mrs allen are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people 
i think you mun know melody i doubt upon my word 
i wish i did 
i wish i had a large acquaintance here with all my heart and then i should get you a partner 
i should be so glad to have you dance 
there goes a strange-looking woman 
what an odd gown she hat got on how old-fashioned it in 
look at the back 
a after some time they received an offer of tea from one of their neighbours 
it was thanked accepted and this introduced a light conversation with the gentleman who offered it which was the only one that anybody spoke to them during the eveningﬁill they were discovered and joined by mr allen when the dance was mum 
a well miss lowland a said he directly d i hope you have had an agreeable ball 
very agreeable indeed a she replied vainly endeavouring to hide a great yawn 
d i wish she had been able to dance 2 laid his wife 
i wish we could have got a partner for her 
i have been saying how glad i could if the skins were here this winter instead of last 
or if the party 
therefore no i 
norther abbey 
had come as they talked of once she might have danced with george party 
i am so sorry be bad not had a partner 
a e shall do better another evening i hope a wan mr allen consolation 
the company began to disperse when the dancing was over enough to leave space for the remainder to walk about in some comfort 
and now was the time for a heroine who had not yet played a very distinguished part in the event of the evening to be noticed and admired 
every eve minutes by removing name of the crowd gave greater openings for her charms 
she was now seen by my young men who had not been near her before 
not one however mad with rapture wonder on beholding her no whisper of eager inquiry ran round the morn nor was the once called a divinity by anybody 
yet catherine was in very good looks and had the company only seen her three yearn before they would now have thought her exceedingly handsome 
she war looked at however and with some admiration 
for in her own hearing two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl 
such words had their due effect she immediately thought the evening plea canter than she had found it before her humble vanity was contented 
the felt more obliged to the two young men for this simple plain than a true quality heroine would have been for fifteen bonnets in lebanon of her charms and went to her chair in good humour with everybody and perfectly satiated with her share of public attention

very morning now brought in regular duties 
shops were to be visited some new part of the town to he looked at and the pump-room to be attended where they paraded up and down for an hour looking at everybody and speaking to no one 
the wish of as numerous acquaintance in bath was still uppermost with mrs allen and she repeated it after every fresh proof which every morning brought of her knowing nobody at all 
they made their appearance in the lower rooms 
and here fortune was more favourable to our heroine 
the master of the ceremonies introduced to her a very gentleman-like young man as a partner 
his name was volney 
he seemed to be about four or live and twenty was rather tall had a pleasing countenance a very intelligent and lively e e and if not quite hand was very near it 
is address was good and catherine felt herself in high luck 
there was little leisure for speaking while they danced 
but when they were seated at ten the found him as amiable as she had already given him credit for being 
he talked with agency and spirit and there was an archness and pleasantly in his manner which interested though it was hardly understood by her 
after chatting some lime on such matters as naturally arose from the objects around them he suddenly addressed her with 
i have hitherto been very remains madam in the proper attentions of a partner here 
i have not yet asked you how long you have been in bath whether you were ever here before whether you have been at the upper rooms the theatre and the concert and how you like the place altogether 
i have been very negligent 
but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars 
if you are 
i will begin directly

d no trouble i assure you ma'am then form 
in his features into a set smile and aﬁ'ectedly softening his voice he added with a spelling air d have you been long in bath madam 
b c about a week sir a replied catherine trying not to laugh 
a really l e with affected astonishment 
a why should you be surprised sir 
b c why indeed 3 said he in his natural tone 
a but some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply and surprise is more easily assumed and not less reasonable than any other 
now let us go on 
were you never here before madam t d never stir a indeed 
have you yet honoured the upper rooms lu a yes sir 
i was there last monday d have you been to the theatre 
b c yes sir 
i was at the play on tuesday c to the concert 
b c yes sir 
on wednesday c and are you altogether pleased with bath 10 b c yes 
i like it very well a now i must give one smirk and then we my be rational again catherine turned away her head not knowing whether she might venture to laugh 
if i see what you think of me a mid he gravely 
d i shall make but a poor figure in your journal to 
arrow a my journal 
a 
a yes 
i know exactly what you will say 
friday went to the lower rooms 
wore my shrugged 
muslin robe with blue trimming plain black shoes 
appeared to much advantage but was strangely harassed by a 
norther abbey 
150 queer half-waked man who would make me dance with him and distressed me by his nonsense 2 indeed i shall say no such thing 
a shall i tell you what you ought to my 2 
d if you please d i danced with a agreeable young man introduced by mr king 
ha a great deal of conversation with him 
seems a most extraordinary genius 
hope i may know more of him 
that madam is what i arid you to say a but perhaps i keep no journal 2 perhaps you are not sitting in this room and i am not sitting y you 
these are points in which i. doubt is equally possible 
not keep a journal 
how are your absent cousins to understand the tenure of your life in bath without one 
how are the civilities and compliments of every day to related as they ought to be unless noted down every evening in a journal 
how are your various dresses to he remembered and the particular state of your complexion and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversity without having constant recourse to a journal 
my dear madam i am not so ignorant of young ladies ways as you wish to believe me 
it is this delightful habit of moralizing which largely contributes to form the easy water of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated 
everybody allows that the talent of writing ambled letters is peculiarly female 
nature may have done something but i am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal d i have sometimes thought a said catherine doubtingly 2 whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen 
that is i should not think the superiority was always on our side d as far as i have had of opportunity of judging it appears to me that the a style of letter-writing y 16a nortkanger abbey 
among women is faultless except in three pardoning c and what are they 
a general deficiency of objects a total invitation to em and a v vent ignorance of grammar a legion my vjbyrdfmlq need not have been afraid of displacing the compliment 
you do not think too highly of in that w 
a should no more ay it down at 3 general rule that women write better letter than men than that they sing better dues or draw better landscapes 
in every power of which taste ll the foundation excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes they were interrupted by mrs allen 
my dear catherine a said the 
do take this a out of my leave 
i am afraid it but tom 2 hole already 
i shall be quite sorry if it hay for this is a favourite gown though it cost but nine shillings a yard 
that i exactly what i should have guessed it madam d said mr volney looking it the main 
a do us understand purlieus sir it particularly well 
i always buy my own cravats and am allowed to be an excellent judge 
and my sister hat often trusted me in the choice of a gown 
i bought one for her the other day and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it 
i gave but gave shillings a yard for it and a true indian muslin men allen was quite struck by his genius 
a men common 
take so little notice of those thing said the 
a chance never get mr allen to know one of my gowns from another 
you must be a great comfort to your litter air a i hope i am madam 
e and pray air who do you think of mill lowlands gown 
a norther abbey 
i 7 2 it is very re madam said he gravely examining it 
but l’ddtlimt think it will wall well 
i am afraid it will fraud a how can you said catherine laughing 2 he so 
— 
d she had almost said a strange 
d i am quite of your opinion sir a replied my allen 
e and so i told miss morals when she bought it a but then you know madam muslin alway turn 
to some account or other 
miss moran will get enough out of it for handkerchief or a on or a cloak 
muslin can never be said to be wasted 
have heard my sister say to forty times when the has been extravagant in buying more than the wanted or careless in cutting it to pieces 
a both in a charming place sir 
there are so many good shops here 
we are sadly off in the country not but what we have very good shops in salisbury but it is so far to go 
eight miles is a long way 
mr allen say it is nine measured nine 
but i am sure it can not be more than eight 
and it is such i flag 
i come back tired to death 
now here one can step out of doors and get a thing in over minutes mr kidney was polite enough to seem interested in what the said 
and she kept him on the subject of millions till the dancing recommenced 
catherine feared at she listened to their discourse that he indulged himself a little too much with the foibles of others 
a what are you thinking of to earnestly 
a said he as they walked back to the ball-room 
d not of your partner i hope for by that shake of the head your meditations are not satisfactory catherine coloured and said a i was not thinking of anything 2 that ll artful and deep to be cure 
but i had rather be told at once that you will not tell me 18 norther abbey 
a well then i will not a thank you 
for now we shall soon be acquainted as i am authorities to tease you on this subject whenever we meet and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much they danced again 
and when the assembly closed parted on the lady's side at lent with a strong inclination for continuing the acquaintance 
whether she thought of him so much while she drank her warm wine and water and prepared herself for bed as to dream of him when there can not be ascertained but i hope it was no more than in a slight slumber or a morning doze at most 
for if it be true as a celibate writer has maintained that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentleman's love is declared a it must he very in proper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before the gentleman ts first known to hive dreamt of her 
how proper mr kidney might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered mr alleys head but that he was not objectionable as a common acquaintance for his young charge he was on inquiry misled 
for he had early in the evening taken pains to know who her power was and had been assured of mr tiles being a clergyman and of a very respectable family in gloucestenhire

crowds of people were every moment passing in and out up the steps and down 3 people when nobody cared about and nobody wanted to see 
and he only was absent 
what a delightful place bath is a said mrs allen a they eat down near the great clock after parting the room till they were tired 
and how pleasant it would be if we had any acquaintance here this sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that mrs allen had no collar reason to hope it would be followed with more advantage now 
but we are told to 
despair of nothing we would stain 2 at unwearied diligence our point would gain c and the unwearied diligence with which she had every day wished for the one thing was at length to have m june reward 
for hardly had she been seated ten minutes before a lady of about her own age who was sitting by her and had been looking at her attentively for several minutes 
addressed her with great compliance in these words 
d i think madam i can not be mistaken 
it is a long time since i had the pleasure of being you but not your name allen in this question answered as it remain was the manger pronounced hers to be there 
and mrs allen immediately recognized the future of a formerschonlfellow and intimate whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages and that many years ago 
their joy on this meeting was very great as well it might since they had been contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years 
compliments on good looks now passed 
and after observing how time had slipped away since they were last together how little they had thought of meeting in bath and what pleasure it was to see an old friend they proceeded to make inquiries and give 220 norther abbey 
intelligence as to their families sisters and cousins talking both together far more ready to give than to receive information and each hearing very little what the other said 
mrs there however had one great advantage as a talker over mrs allen in 3 family of children 
and when she satiated on the talents of her sons and the beauty of her daughters when she related their different situations and views that john was at oxford edward at merchant sailors and william at sea and all of them more beloved and respected in their different stations than any other three beings ever were mrs allen had no similar information to give no similar triumphs to press on the unwilling and unbelieving ear of her friend 
and was forcedtositnndappeartolistentoall these maternal effusions consoling herself however with the discovery which her keen eyes soon made that the lace on mrs harpers was not half so handsome as that on her own a here come my dear girls cried mrs there pointing at three mean-looking females who arm in arm were then moving towards her 
a my dear mrs allen i long to introduce them 
the will be so delighted to see you the fullest is save my eldest 
is not she a one young woman 
the others are v much admired too but i believe bell is the handsomest 
the miss theories were introduced 
and miss moran who had been for a short time forgotten was introduced likewise 
the name seemed to strike them all 
and after speaking to her with great civility the eldest young lady observed aloud to the rest 2 how excessively like her brother miss moran is 
2 the very picture of him indeed 
a cried the mother 
and a should have known her any where for his sister 
2 was repeated by them all two or three times over 
for a moment catherine was surprised 
norther abbey 
i l but mr hope and her daughters had scarcely begun the history of their acquaintance with mr james world before she remembered that her eldest brother had lately formed an intimacy with a young man of his own college of the name of hope and that he had spent the last week of the christmas vacation with his family near london 
the whole being explained many obliging things were said by the miss hopes of their wish of being better acquainted with her 
of being considered as already friends through the friendship of their brothers c. which catherine heard with pleasure and answered with all the pretty ax reasons she could command 
and as the first proof of anxiety she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest miss hope and take a turn with her about the room 
catherine was delighted with this extension of her bath acquaintance and almost forgot mr kidney while she talked to miss hope 
friendship is certainly the nest balm for the pangs of disappointed love 
their conversation turned upon those subjects of which the free discussion has generally much to do in affecting a sudden intimacy between two young ladies 
such as dress balls fictitious and fizzed 
miss there however being four years of tigers than miss moran and at least four years better informed had a very decided advantage in discussing such points 
she could compare the balls of bath with those of tunbridge 
in fashion with the fashion of london 
could rectify the opinions of her new friend in many articles of wasteful attire 
could discover a situation between any gentleman and lady who only smiled on each other 
and point out a quiz through the thickness of a crowd 
these powers received due admiration from catherine to whom they were entirely new 
and the respeetwhich they naturally inspired might have been too great for 2 2 norm anger abbey 
familiarity had not the easy gaiety of miss thorns manners and her frequent expressions of delight on this acquaintance with her softened down every feeling of awe and left nothing but tender affection 
their increasing attachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump-room but required when they all quitted it together that miss there should accompany miss moran to the very door of mr alleys house 
and that they should there part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands after learning to their mutual relief that they should see each other across the theatre at night and say their prayers in the same chapel the next morning catherine then ran directly up stairs and watched miss harpers progress down the street from the drawing-room window 
admired the graceful spirit of her walk the fashionable air of her figure and dress and felt grateful as well she might for the chance which had procured her such a friend 
mrs there was a widow and not a very rich one 
she was a good-humoured well-meaning woman and a very indulgent mother 
her eldest daughter had great personal beauty and the younger ones by pretending to be as handsome as their sister imitating her air and dressing in the same style did very well 
this brief account of the family is intended to supposed the necessity of a long and minute detail from mrs hope herself of her past adventures and sufferings which might otherwise be expected to occupy the three or four following chapters in which the worthlesencss of lords and arteries might be set forth 
and conversations which had passed twenty years before he minutely repeated 
norther abbey 
2 that h 
catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening in jamming the nose and smiles of miss horse though they certainly claimed much of her leisure as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for mr tilted in every box which her eye could reach 
but she looked in vain 
mr kidney was no fonder of the play than the pump-room 
she hoped to be more fortunate the next day 
and when her wishes for one weather were answered by tracing a beautiful morning she hardly felt a doubt of it 
for a one sunday in bath emptied every house of its inhabitants and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is 
as soon as divine service was over the horses and alleys eagerly joined each other 
and after staying long enough in the pump-room to discover that the crowd was insupportable and that there was not a genteel face to be seen which everybody discover every sunday throughout the season they hastened away to the descent to breathe the fresh air of better company 
here catherine and isabella arm in arm again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved enunciation 
they talked much and with much enjoyment 
but again was catherine disappointed in her hope of seeing her partner 
he was no where to be met with 
every search for him was equally unsuccessful in morning loungers or evening assemblages hither at the upper nor lower rooms at dressed or lllltll'eseed balls was he conceivable 
nor among the walked the horsemen or the curricle-driven of the morning 
his name was not in the pump-room hook and curiosity could do no more 
he must be gone 249 norther abbey 
from bath 
yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be so short 
this sort of seriousness which is always so becoming in a hero threw a fresh grace in catherine imagination around his person and manners and increased her anxiety to know more of him 
from the horses she could learn nothing for they had been only two days in bath before they met with mrs allen 
it was a subject however in which she often indulged with her sir friend from whom she received every possible encouragement to continue to think of him 
and his impression on her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken 
isabella was very sure that he must be a charming young man 
and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with her dear catherine and would therefore shortly return 
she liked him the better for being a clergyman for she must confess herself very to the profession 
and something like a sigh escaped her as she said it 
perhaps catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion but she was not experienced enough in the dresser of love or the duties of friendship to know when delicate miller was properly called for or when a conference should be forced 
mrs allen was now quite happy quite satisfied with bath 
she had found some acquaintance 
had been so lucky too as to and in them the family of a most worthy old friend 
and as the completion of good fortune had found these friends by no means so expensive dressed as herself 
her daily expressions were no longer i wish we had some acquaintance in bath 
a they were changed into a how glad i am we have met with mrs hope 
e and she was as eager in proposing the intercourse of the two families as her young charge and isabella themselves could be 
never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of my horse in what they called norther abbey 
25 mutations 
but in which then wan scarcely ever any exchange of opinion and not often any resemblance of why t at mrs there walked chiefly of her children an m allen of her gowns 
the progress of the friendship between catherine and label was quick as its beginning had been warm 
and they paused so rapidly through every aggravation of looking tenderness that whereas shortly no fresh roof of it to be given to their friends or themselves 
ll'heytmlled each other brother christiannarne were always arm-in-arm when they walked pinned uz each other train for the dance and were not to be avoided the net 
and if a rainy morning deprived them of other enjoyments they were nil 
resolute din meeting in defiance of wet and dirt and to themselves up to read novels together 
yes novels 
for i will not lost that ingenious and politics custom so common with novel writers of degrading by their contemptuous clair the very performance to the number of which they are themselves adding joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshness epithet on lath works and scarcely ever knitting them to be lead by their own heroine who if she accidentally take up a novel i 
sure to turn over its rapid page with aslant if the heroine of one novel be not harmonized by the heroine of mother from whom can flit expect protection and regard 
i not approve of it let us leave it to the review to bathe such tllilsinrna of fancy at their leisure and over every new novel to talk in threadbare trains of the trash with which the press 
now groans 
let no not desert one another 
we are an injured body 
although our productions lave afforded more extensive and unall’ected pleasure than those of any other literary corporation in the world no species of composition has been so much decried 
from pride ignorance or fashion our foes are almost c 26 norther abbey 
as many as our readers 
and while the realities of the one-hundredth bridge of the history of england or of the man who collecting and polished in a volume some dozen lines of milton pope and prior with a paper from the spectator and a chapter from sterner are apologized by a thousand pens there seems almost a general wish of drying the ca city and undertaking the labour of the novelty and orslighu'ng the performance which have only genius wit and taste to recommend them 
d i am no novel reader 
i seldom look into novels 
do not imagine that i often read novels 
it is really very well for a novelty such is the common cant 
e and what are you reading miss 
— 1/2 oh 
it is only a novel 
a replies the young lady 
while she lays down her book with affected india hence or momentary shame 
a it is only cecily or chill or belinda 
or in short only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature the happiest definition of its varieties the loveliest effusion wit and humour are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language 
now had the some young lady been engaged with a volume of the spectator inmate of such a work how proudly would she have produced the book and told its name 
though the chance must be against her being occupied bandy part of that voluminous publication of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person taste 
the substance film papers so often contrasting in the statement of improbable circumstances unnatural character and topics of conversation which no longer concern any one living 
and their language too frequently so coarse a to give no very favourable idea of the age that could endure it

and catherine after listening and agreeing on long an the could with all the civility and deference of the youthful female mind fearful of hazarding an opinion of its own in opposition to that of a uelf-auured man especially where the beauty of her own sex ll concerned ventured at length to vary the subject by a question which had been long uppermost in her thoughts it wan

i was thinking of that other stupid book written by that woman they make such fuss about

i took up the in volume once and looked it over but i soon found it would not do

but he was amiss friend and isabella s brother 
and her jluigrneut was further bought of my isabella assuring her when they withdrew to see the new hat that john thought her the most charming girl in the world and by john's engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening 
had she been older or gainer arch attacks might have done little 
but where youth and diffidence are united it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to relate attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world and being is very early engaged as a partner

did we should certainly be gyrated the whole evening catherine accepted thin kindness with gratitude and they confronted no they were for three minutes longer when isabella who had been talking to james 
on the other tide of her turned again to hit litter and whispered a my dear creature i am afraid i most leave you your brother ii to amazing impatient to begin

she could not help being vexed at the noon co of mr hope r the not only longed to he dancing but was likewise aware that an the rug dignity of her situation could not be known the was sharing with the core of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wincing a partner 
to be degraded in the eye of the world to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart in all a her union 
all innocence and the rniaconduct s another the true source of her element in one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the eminent liquor her fortitude under it what particularly dignified her character 
catherine had fortitude too 
the jaw murmur pained her lips 
nothing er abbey 
421 from this name of humiliation the win roused at the end of an minutes to a pleasanter feeling by seeing 
not mr hope but mr kidney within three yards of the place where they not he seemed to be moving that way but he did not lee her and therefore the smile and the blush which hit sudden re-appearance raised in catherine paced away without pulling her heroic importance 
he looked as handsome and a lively at ever and wan talking with interest to a fashionable and planing-looking young woman who leant on his arm and whom catherine immediately guests to be his litter 
thus thinking throwing away a fair opportunity of considering him lost to her for ever by being married already 
but guided only by what was aim leg and probable it had never entered her head that mr kidney could be married 
he had not behaved he had not talked like the married men to whom he had been need 
he had never mentioned a wife and he had acknowledged a sister 
from there circumstance span the incident conclusion of hit lip now being by hi ride 
and therefore instead of turning of a deathlike planets and falling in a lit on mr allen bosom catherine that erect in the perfect one of her bonnet and with cheek only a little redder than usual 
mr tile and his companion who continued though slowly to approach were immediately preceded by a lady an acquaintance of my horse 
and thin lady are in to speak to her they an belonging to her hopped kettle and catherine catching mr tilney’e eye instantly received from him the smiling tribute of fiction 
she returned it with pleasure and then advancing till nearer he spoke both in her and my allen by whom he war very civilly acknowledged

i tell him he in quite in luck to be cent here for his health

ere th were interrupted by a request from mrs hope to are allen that the would move a little to accommodate man laughed and men kidney with seats at they had agreed to join their party 
this was accordingly done mr kidney still continuing standing before them 
and after a few minutes consideration he asked catherine to dance with him 
this compliment delightful as it was produced severe mortification to the lady 
and in giving her denial the expressed her sorrow on the occasion to very much at if he really felt it that had there who joined her just afterwards been half a minute earlier he might have thought her suffering 
rather too acute 
the very easy manner in which he then told her that he had kept her waiting did not by any meant reconcile her more to her lot 
nor did the particulars which he entered into while they norther abbey 
4d were standing up of the coronet and forgot the friend whom he had just left and of i proposed exchange of terriers between them interest her in much an to prevent her looking ve often towards that part of thereon where she had eft mr kidney 
of her dear isabella in whom he particularly longed to point out that gentleman she co d lee nothing 
they were in different sea 
she was separated from all her party and away from all her acquaintance 
one mortification succeeded another and from the whole the deduced this real london that to go previously engaged to a hall does not necessary increase either the dignity or enjoyment of a young lady

and turning round served my hugh directly behind her mended mix tile and n genevan 
i beg your pardon a world a aid she for thin liberty but i can not anyhow get to mine hope 
and my mid he was cure you would not have the lean objection to letting in this young lady by you mrs hugely could not have a lied to any creature in the room more happy to oblige her than catherine 
the young ladies were introduced to each other mine kidney expressing a proper genial touch goodness 
mist garland 
with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of the obligation 
and my burghers 
fatigued with having so respect settled her young charge returned to her party

and her air though it had not the decided pretension the route juli-hoe“ of mill thoreau had more real elegance 
her manner showed good fence and good breeding 
they were neither thy nor iﬁectedly open 
and she yearned capable of being young attractive and at a bell without wanting to ix the mention of every man near her and 4d vdrthanger abbey 
without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or in 
conceivable vexation on e little trying occurrence 
catherine interested at once y her appearance and her relationship to mr kidney was desirous of being acquainted with her and readily talked therefore whenever she could think of anything to say and had courage and leisure for saying it 
but the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy by the frequent want of one or more of these requisites prevented their doing more than going through the first regiment of an acquaintance by informing themselves how well the other liked bath how much she admired its building and surrounding caitlin-z 
whether she drew or played or sang and whether e was fond of riding on horseback 
the two dances were scarcely concluded before catherine found her arm gently seized by her faithful isabella who in great spirits exclaimed at last i have got you 
my dearest creature i have been looking for you this hour 
what could induce you to come into this set when you knew i was in the other 
i have been quite wretched without you 
my dear isabella how was it possible for me to get at you 
i could not even see where you were a so i told your brother all the time but he would not believe me 
do go and see for her mr moran said i 
but all in vain he would not stir an inch 
was not it so mr moran 
but you men are all so immoderately lazy 
i have been scolding him to such a degree my dear catherine you would be quite amazed 
you know i never stand upon ceremony with such people look it that young lady with the white bends round her head a whispered catherine reaching her friend from james 2 it is mr volney s sister 
oh heavens 
you don't say so 
let me look at norther essay

what a deal ful girl 
i never saw anything half so beautiful

you are not to listen 
we are not talking about you but what is all this whispering about

b c here now i knew how it would be 
you men have such restless curiosity 
talk of the cnrioaityof men indeed

but be satisfied 
for you are not to know anything at all of the matter 
and is that like to satisfy me do you think 
a well i declare l never knew anything like you 
what can it signing to you what we are talking of 10 perhaps we are king about you 
therefore i would advise you not to listen or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable in this commonplace chatter which lasted some time the original subject seemed entirely forgotten 
and though catherine was very well pleased to have it dropped for a while she could not avoid a little suspicion at the total succession of all isabella impatient desire to see mr t nay 
when the orchestra struck up a fresh dance james would have led his fair partner away but she resisted 
i tell you mr lowland a she cried i would not do such a thing for all the world 
how can you he so teasing 
only conceive m dear catherine what your brother wants me to do 
he want me to dance with him again though i tell him that it is a most improper thing and entirely against the rules 
it would make us theralkoftheplaceﬁl’ we were not to change ears

well remember that it in not to fault if we recall the old ladies bath in a bustle 
time along my dearest catherine for heaven sake and stand b meek and of they went to regain their former place 
oh there in the meanwhile had walked away 
and catherine ever willing to give mr kidney an opportunity of thing the agreeable request which had already latter her once made her way to my allen and mrs to a fasten should in the hope of sending him nil with them a hope which when it proved to be fruitless she felt to have been highly unreasonable 
a well my dear 2 aid my horse impatient for prize of her own i hope you have had in agreeable partner a very agreeable madam

d i must say it though i as his mother that there not a more agreeable young me in the world 
this inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many 
but it did not puzzle men allen 
for after only a moment consideration the said in a whisper to catherine d i dare say she thought i was speaking of her son 
catherine was disappointed and vexed 
she seemed to have missed by so little the very object she had had in view 
and this persuasion did not incline her to a very gracious reply when john the came up to her soon afterwards and mid dwell moran i neroge’yonandiare to stand up and jig it together i i 
oh no i i am much obliged you our two dances cover

come along with me and i will show you the our greatest quarters in the room 
my two younger sisters and their partners 
i have been laughing at them this half hour again catherine excused herself 
and at last he walked off to quiz his sisters by himself 
the rest of the evening she found very dull 
mr kidney was drawn away from their party at tea to amend that of his partner 
miss kidney though belonging to it did not sit near her i and james and isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the latter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one until one squeeze and one 
dearest catherine 
so northern gear abbey 
coster a 
he progress of catherine unhappiness from the events of the evening was as follows 
it ape peered wrist in a general dissatisfaction with everybody about her while she remained in the rooms which y brought on considerable various and a violent desire to go home 
this on arriving in plenty street took the direction of extraordinary hunger and when that was a changed into an earnest longing to he in bed 
such was the extreme 
not of her distress for when there she immediately into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours and from which she awoke perfectly revived in excellent spirits with fresh hopes and fresh schemes 
the first wish of her heart was to improve her no distance with miss tile and almost her first rest upon to seek her for that purpose in the pump-mom at noon 
in the pump-room one so newly arrived in bath must be met with 
and that building the had already found so favourable for the discovery of female excellence and the completion of female intimacy so admirably adapted for secret discourse and unlimited conscience that she was most reasonably encouraged to expect another friend from within its walls 
her plan for the morning thus settled she sat quietly down to her book for breakfast resolving to remain in the same place and the same employment will the clock struck one 
and from habitude very little incommoded by the remarks and ejaculations of mrs allen whose fancy of mind and incapacity for thinking were such 
that as she never talked a great deal so she could never be entirely latent 
and therefore while she sat at her work if she lost her needle or broke her thread if she heard a carriage in themegorsawaspeckuponhergown chemist norther abbey 
i observe it aloud whether there were any one at leisure to answer her or not 
at about half-past twelve a remarkably loud rap drew her in hate to the window and scarcely had she time to inform catherine of there being two open carriages at the door in the rest only a servant her brother driving miss thorns in the second 
before john there came running up stairs calling out a well miss moran here i am 
have you been waiting long 
we could not come before the old devil of a coachman was such an eternity sending out a thing it to be got into and now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are out of the street 
how do you do mrs allen 9 a famous hall but night 
was not it 
come miss moran quick for the others are in a confounded hurry to be all they want to get their tumble over 
a what do you mean 
said catherine 
where are you all going to it 
going to 
why you have not forgot our en 
engagement 
did not we agree together to take a drive this morning 
what a head you have 
we are going up cavern down 
a something was said about it 
i remain a said catherine looking at mrs allen for her opinion 
but really i did not expect you 
d not expect reel that a good one 
and what a dust you would have made if i had not come 
a catherine's silent appeal to her friend meanwhile wan entirely thrown away 
for mrs allen not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression herself by a lock was not aware of its being ever intended bandy body clue 
and catherine whose desire of seeing miss kidney again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive and who thought there could be no impropriety in her going with mr hope as isabella s 2 norther abbey 
was going it the some time with james was therefore obliged to speak plainer 
a well mean what do you any to it 
can you spare me for an hour or two

m dearer mare a cried hell to whom the duty of ennui immediately called her before the could get into the carriage you have been at lean three hours getting ready i was afraid you were ill 
what a delightful ball we had last night 
i have a thousand thing to lay to you 
but make ham and get in for i long to be off catherine followed her orders and turned away but not too soon to hear her friend exclaim aloud to james what a sweet girl the it 
i quite coat on her b you will not be frightened mine lowland a aid there an he handed her in if my horse should dance about a little at in getting old he will most likely give a plunge or two and perth take the rest for a minute 
but he will noon know his master 
he is full of spirits plays at can be but there in no vice in him catherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one but it wan too late to retreat and the wax too young to own herself frightened

everything being then arnorthanger abbey 
if urged theuemntwho cod at the hone’eheldwu bid in an important voice to let him go and of they went in the quietest manner imaginable without a plunge or a caper or anything like one 
catherine delighted at to happy an escape spoke her pleasure aloud with grateful tux-prize 
and her companion immediately made the matter perfectly aim e by naming her that it was entirely owing to the peace early judicious manner in which he had then held the nine and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he had directed his whip 
catherine though the could not help wondering that with lush perfect command of his 
home he should think it necessary to alarm her with a relation of its tricks congratulated herself inserted on being under the care of 250 excellent a coachman 
and perceiving that the animal continued to go on in the lame quiet manner without having the smallest proclivity towards any unpleasant vivacity and considering in inevitable ca m ten mile an hour by no men charmingly lit gave herself up to all the enjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorated kind in a one mild day of february with the consciousness of safety

it was broken by 10 saying very shrug truly a old allen in as rich up a aw in not he

e s this reception brought on a loud and overpowering reply of which no m am very distinct 
except the frequent exclamation amounting almost to oaths which adorned it and catherine was left what it ended with rather i strengthened belief of there being a great deal of wine drunk in oxford and the same happy conviction of her bother comparative sobriety 
thereat idea then all reverted to the merit of his own equipage and the wan called on to admire the mint and freedom with which him one moved along and the ease which hit paces a well up the excellence of the springs gave the motion of the carriage

his knowledge and her ignorance of the subject his rapidity of expression and her residence of herself put that out of her power 
the could strike out nothing new in commendation but she readily echoed whatever he chose to interest and it war finally needed between them without any difficulty that his equal gie wan altogether the most complete of in kind in england his carriage the nearest hit none the best goer and himself the bent coachman

they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on

oh lordy what is there in that

the carriage is safe enough if a man knows how to drive it 
a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty years after it is fairly worn our 
lord bless on 
i would undertake for five pounds to drive it to hark and back again without losing a nail 
catherine listened with astonishment 
she knew not how to reconcile two such very different accounts of the same thing 
for she had not been brought up to understand the propensities of a rattle nor to know to how man i e assertions and impatient falsehoods the excess of vanity will lead 
her own family were plain mtter-of-fact people who seldom aimed at wit of any kind 
her father at the utmost being contented with a pun and her mother with a proper 
they were not in the habit therefore of yelling lies to increase their importance or of asserting at one moment what they would contradict the next 
she reflected on the affair for some time in much perplexity and was more than once on the point of requesting from mr hope a clearer insight into his real opinion on the subject 
but she checked herself because it appeared to her that he did not exceed in giving those clearer nights in making those things plain which he had before made amby out and joining to this the consideration that he would not really supper his sister and his friend to be exposed to a danger from which he might easily remove them she concluded at last that he must know the carriage to be in fact perfectly safe and therefore would alarm herself norther abbey 
s 7 no longer 
by him the whole matter seemed entirely forgotten 
and all the m of hicouvemtion or rather talk began and ended with himself and hit own concerns 
he told her of horner which he had bought for a rise and sold for incredible sums 
of racing matches in which his judgment had infallibly foretold the winner 
of cheating partner in which he had killed more binds though without having one good host than all hit companion together 
and described to her come famous day's sport with the fox 
hounds in which his bright and still in directing the dogs had the mistake of the most experienced huntlrnan 
and in which the holder of his riding though it had never endangered his own life for a moment had been constantly leading others into difficulties which he calmly concluded had broken the necks of many 
little up catherine was in the habit of judging for herself and unfixed as were her general notion 
of what men ought to be he could not entirely repress a doubt while the bore with the eﬂ'uaione of hit endless conceit of his being altogether completely agreeable 
it was a bold six-mile for he was inabelh’e brother and the had been marred by james that his manner would recommend him to all her sex 
but in spite of thin the extreme weakness of his company which crept over her before dignity had been out j 
hour and which continued unceasing to increase 2 th in pup renew street again induced her in no mean to resign ouch high authority and to disturb his power of giving universal pleasure 
when the arrived at my allen s door the astonishment o isabella was hardly to be expended on ending that tutor late in thedayforthemtn and her friend into the mule 
— put three o'clock 
a it was inconceivable incredible impossible and he would neither believe her own watch nor her e 18 norther abbey 
brothers nor the servants she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality till moran produced his watch and ascertained the fact to have doubted a moment longer 150 would have been equally inconceivable incredible and impossible and she could only protest over and over again that no two hours and a hat had ever gone of so swiftly before as catherine was called on to confirm 
catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please isabella 
but the latter was spared the misery of her friend s dissecting voice by not waiting for her answer 
her own feelings entirely engrossed her 
her wretchedness was most acute on ending herself obliged to go directly home 
it was ages since she had had a moment conversation with her dearest catherine and though she had such thousands of things to say to her it appeared as if they were never to be together again 
so with smiles of most exquisite misery and the laughing eye of utter despondency she bade her friend adieu and went on 
catherine found mrs allen returned from all the busy idleness of the morning and was immediately greeted with a well my dear here you are 
d a truth which she had no greater inclination than power to dispute 
and i hope you have had a pleasant aiming 
b c yes ma'am i thank you 
we could not hive had a nicer day so mrs horse said 
she was vastly pleased at your all going b you have seen mrs hope then p b c yes 
i went to the pump-room as soon as you were gone and there i met her and we had a great deal of talk together

we agreed to take a turn in the crescent and there we met mrs bushes and mr and miss tile walking with her 
d if ou indeed 
and did they to go “yenywe walked along the great togither for half an hour 
they seem very agreeable people 
miss kidney was in a very pretty spotted muslin and i fancy by what i can learn that she always dresses very handsomely 
mrs burghers talked to me a great deal about the family and what did she tell you of them 9 
oh 
a vast deal indeed 
the hardly talked of anything else 
a did she tell you what part of gloucestershire they come from 9 
yes she did but i can not recollect now 
but th are very good kind of people and very rich 
mrs 10 hey was a miss summons and she and mrs bushes were school-fellows 
and mist dnmunond had a very large fortune and when she married her father gave her twenty thousand pounds and eve hundred to buy wedding clothes 
mrs burghers saw all the clothes after they came from the warehouse 
e and are mr and mrs tilted in bath 
b c yes i fancy they are but i am not quite certain 
upon recollection however i have a notion they are both dead 
at least the mother is 
yes i am sure mr kidney is dead because mrs burghers told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that mr diamond gave his daughter on her wedding-day and that miss kidney has got now for they were put by for her when her mother died 
and is mr kidney my partner the only son 2 
i can not be quite positive about that my dear 
i have some idea he is 
but 
however he is a very one go norther abbey

catherine inquired no further 
she had heard enough to feel that mrs allen had no real intelligence to give and that she was most particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister 
could she have foreseen such a circumstance nothing should have persuaded her to go out with the others 
and as it was she could only lament her ill luck and think over what she had lost till it was clear to her that the drive had no means been very pleasant and that john horse himself was quite disagreeable 
sotto 2 
he allas theories and lowlands all met in the evening at the theatre 
and as catherine and isabella sat together there was then an opportunity for the latter to utter some few of the many thousand things which had been collecting within her for communication in the immeasurable length of time which had divided them 
a oh heavens 
my beloved catherine have i got you at last 
2 was her address on catherine entering the box and sitting by her 
now mr lowland a or he was close to her on the other side i shall not speak another word to you all the rest of the evening

but i need not ask you for you look delightfully 
you really have done your hair in a more heavenly style than ever

your brother and i were agreeing this morning that though it it vastly well to be here for a few weeks we would not live here for millions 
we mun found out that our tame were exactly alike in preparing the country to every other place 
really our opinion were so exactly the some it war quite ridiculous 
there was not a single point in which we differed 
i would not have had you by for the world 
you are such i sly thing i am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it a no indeed i should not a oh yes 
you would indeed 
i know you better than you know yourself

my cheek would have been a red as your arm 3 i would not have had you by for the world a indeed you do me injustice

i catherine s resolution of endeavouring to meet miss kidney again continued in full force the next morning 
and till the usual moment of going to the pump-room she felt some alarm from the dread of a second prevention 
but nothing of that kind occurred no visitors appeared to delay them and they three set of in good time for the pump-room where the order course of events and conversation took place 
r allen 
after drinking his glass of water joined some gentlemen to talk over the politics of the day and compare the accounts of their newspapers 
and the ladies walked about together noticing every new face and almost ever new bonnet in the room 
the female part of the hope family attended by james moran appeared among the crowd in less than a quarter of an hour and catherine immediately took her usual place by the side of her friend 
james who was now in constant attendance maintained a similar position and separating themselves from the rest of their party they walked in that manner for some time till catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which containing her entirely to her friend and brother gave 
her very little share in the cornice of either 
they were always engaged in some sentimental discussion or lively dispute but their sentiment was conveyed in such ring voices and their vivacity attended with so much laughter that though catherine's supporting opine 
in was not frequently called for by one or the other she was never able to give any from not having heard a word of the subject 
at length however she was overpowered to disengage herself from her friend by the avowed necessity of speaking to miss kidney whom the most joyﬁrllysswjust entering the room with mrs bushes and whom she instantly joined with a farmer determination to be a pointed 
than she might love had courage to common had she not been urged by the disappointment norther abbey 
6d of the before 
miss tilneyrnetherwith grunt civility returned her advance with equal good will and they continued talking together as long as both parties remained in the room 
and though in all probability not an observation was made nor an expression need by either which had mother made and need some thousands of time before under that roof in every bath season yet the merit of their being spoken with simplicity and truth and without personal conceit might be something uncommon 
how well your brother dances was an articles exclamation of catherine towards the close of their conversation which ii once surprised and amused her companion 
henry 
2 the replied with a mile 
ye be due dance very well a he must have thought it very odd to hear me say i was engaged the other evening when he saw me sitting down 
but i really had been engaged the whole day to mr hope 
mine kidney could only bow 
a on can not think a added catherine after a moment silence how surprised i was to one him again 
i felt to lure of his being quite gone away 
when henry had the pleasure of seeing you before he wan in bath but for a couple of days 
he came only to engage lodging for us 
2 that never occurred to me 
and of course not seeing him anywhere i thought he must be gone 
we not the young lady he danced with on monday 3 ma 
smith 
b c yes 
an acquaintance of mr highest 
i dare lay the was very glad to dance 
do you think her pretty i d a not very 
he never come to the pump-room i suppose 2 d ye 
sometimes 
but he has rid out thin morning with my father g o e 6d norther abbey 
men ought now joined them and marked minx tilneyiflhewaereadytogo 
i hopelehallhave the place of seeing you again soon a laid catherine 
shall you he at the postilion ball to-morrow 3 2 perhaps we 
yes i think we certainly hall a i am glad of it or we shall all be there 
civility was duly returned and they parted on miss tilney’a side with some knowledge of her nevucquninunce e feelings and on catherine without the smallest oonecioutneu of having explained them 
she went home very happy 
the morning had ushered all her hopes and the evening of the following day was now the object of expectation 
the future good 
what gown and what head-dress should worn the occasion became her chief concern 
she can not be joined in it 
dream in at all times a furtive 
lone distinction and exclusive solicitude about it often destroy its own aim 
catherine knew all thin very well 
her great aunt had reached lecture the subject only the christmas before 
and yet he lay awake ten minutes on wednesday night beating between her spotted and her laboured mullion 
and nothing but the ahnrtneu of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening 
thin would have been an error in judgment great though not uncommon from which one of the other gear rather than her own a brother rather than i great aunt might have warned her 
for mine only can be aware of the insensibility of man towards a new gown 
it would be mortifying to the feelings of many ladies could they be made to understand how little the heart of man ll affected by what is costly or new in their mire 
how little it ll haunted by the texture of their muslin and how unaueeeptihle of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted 
the dragged the full or the coroner 
woman ll one for her own satisfaction alone 
no man will admire her the more no norther abbey 
of woman will like her the better for it 
neatness and fashion are enough for the former and o something of dnabbinete or impropriety will be most endeavouring to the later 
but not one of these grave reﬂectiontroubled the tranquillity of catherine 
she entered the rooms on sunday evening with feelingvery different from what had attended her thither the monday before 
she had then been exulting in her engagement to hope and was now chiefly anxious to avoid his night 
lest he should engage her again 
for though the could not dared not expect that mr kidney should all her i third time to dance her wishes hopes and plans all centred in nothing less 
every young lady may feel for my heroine in thin critical moment for every young lady has at some time or other known the name agitation 
all have been or at learn all have believed themselves to be in danger from the pursuit of some one whom they wished to avoid 
and all have been anxious for the attention of tome one whom they wished to please 
as soon an they were joined by the the s catherine's agony began 
the dotted about if on there came toward her hid herself at much as possible from his view and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear him 
the cotillione were over the country-dancing beginning and the saw nothing of the tiny 
a do not be frightened my dear catherine a whisper nelly but i am really going to dance with your brother again 
i declare positively it in quite shocking 
i tell him he ought to he ashamed of himself but you and john must keep us in countenance 
make hate my dear creature and come to un 
john in just walked off but he will be back in a moment 
catherine had neither time nor inclination to answer 
the other 
walked away 
john who was mill in view and the gave herself up for in 
she might be norther abbey 
not appear however to observe or expect him she kept her eyes intently fixed on her fan 
and a self-condemnation for her folly in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet with the chimneys in any reasonable time had june red through her mind when she suddenly found be addressed and again solicited to dance by mr t volney himself 
with what sparkling eyes and ready motion she granted his request and with how pleasing a scutter of heart she went with him to the set may be easily imagined 
to escape and as she believed so narrow escape john hope and to be asked so immediate y on his joining her asked by mr kidney as if he had sought her on purpose l 
— it did not appear to her that life could supply any greater felicity 
scarce had they worked themselves into the quiet possession of a place however when her attention was claimed by john those who stood behind her 
heya miss moran 
a said he that is the meaning of this 
i thought you and i were to dance together 
a 10 wonder you should think so for you never asked me 
“thatissgoodone by jove 
i sskedymassoou as i came into the room and i was just going so ask on again but when i turned round you were gone 
his is a cursed shabby trick 
i only came or the sake of dancing with you and i firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since monday 
as 
i remember i asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak 
and here have i been telling all my acquaintance that i was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room 
and when they see you standing up with somebody else they will quiz me famous y a oh 
no 
they will never think of use after such s description as that 
rout-tans” 
abbey 
6d aby heavens 
if they do not i will kick tenant of the room for blockhead 
what chap have you there 3 2 catherine satiated his curiosity 
a tiny 2 he repeated 
hum 
i do not know him 
a good figure of a man 
well put together 
does he want a horse 
here is a friend of mine slam fetch us got one to sell that would suit anybody 
a famous clever animal or the road 
only forty guinea 
i had fifty minds to buy it myself for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when i meet with one 
but it would not answer my purpose it would not do for the old 
i would give any money for a real good hunter 
i have three now the best that ever were held 
i would not take eight hundred guinea for them 
father and i mean to get a house in leicestershire against the next season 
it 
is so d 
uncomfortable living at an inn this was the last sentence by which he could weary catherine's attention for he was just then born of by the aisles pressure of a long string of passing ladies her partner now drew near and said that gentleman would have put me out of patience had he said with you half minute longer 
he has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me 
we have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening and all our agreeablenest belongs toller to each other for that time 
nobody can fasten themselves on the cornice of one without injuring the rights of the other 
i consider a country-man as an emblem of marriage 
fidelity and compliance are the principal duties of both 
and those men who do not chase to dance or marry themselves 
have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours 2 but they are such very different things 
2 that you think the can not be compared together 
c to be sure not 
people that marry'n neverpart 6d nona-hanger andrew 
but must go and keep house together 
people that dance only stand opposite to each other in a long am for half an hour c and such is your decision of matrimony and dancing 
taken in that light certainly their resemblance is not striking 
but i think i could place them in such a view 
you will allow that in both man has the advantage of choice woman only the power of refusal 
that in both it is an engagement between man and woman formed for the advantage of each 
and that when once entered into they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution 
that it is their duty each to endeavour to give no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfection of their new hours or fancying that they should have been better of with any one else 
you will allow this 
a yes to be sure as you rate it all this sounds very well 
but still they are so very different 
i can not look upon them at all in the same light nor think the same duties belong to them 
a in one respect there certainly is a difference 
in marriage the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman 
the woman to make the home agreeable to the man 
he is to curve and she is to smile 
but in dancing their duties are exactly changed 
the agreeahleness the compliance are expected from him while she furnishes the an and the leader water 
that i suppose was the difference of duties which struck on as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison 
d no indeed i never thought of that then i am quite at i loss 
one thing however i must observe 
this disposition on your side is rather alarming 
you totally allow any similarity in the obligations 
and may i not thence infer that your northangbr abbey 
6d notions of the duties of the dancing state are not w strict no your partner might will have i not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return or if any other gentleman were to address you there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose 2 
a mr thorns in such a very particular friend of my brothers that if he talk to me i mun talk to him again 
but there are hardly three young men in the room bedded him that i have any acquaintance wi a hand it that to being only security 
also 
alas 
nay i urn sure that you can not have a better 
for if i do not know anybody it it impossible for me to talktothem 
and besides i do not want to talk to anybody 
now you have given me a security worth having 
and i shall proceed with courage 
do you and bath uz agreeable when i had the honour of making the inquiry 
before i a b s quite 
more 10 indeed more to 
take care or ou will forget to be tired of it at the proper time 
on ought to be tired at the end of six weeks d i do not think i should be tired if i were to my here six months 2 bath compared with london little variety and to everybody and out every year 
for six weeks i allow both is pleasant enough 
but beyond that it in the most tiresome place in the world you would be told so by people of all description who come regularly every winter lengthen their mix week into ten or twelve and go away at last beam they can afford to any no longer 
well other people must judge for themselves and those who go to london may think nothing of bath 
but i who live in a small retired village in the country 750 norther abbey 
can never and greater madness in such a place as this than in my own home 
for here are a variety ofnmnsememe a variety of things to be seen and done all day long which i can know nothing of there 
you are not fond of the country 
a yes i am 
i have always lived there and always been very happy 
but certainly there is much more bareness in a country life than in a bath life 
one day in the country is exactly like another 
a but then you open your time so much more rationally in the country d do i p 
do you not a i do not believe there is much difference 
a here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long a and so i am at home only i do not ends much of it 
i walk about here and so i do there 
but here i see a variety of people in eve street and there i can on go and call on mrs allen 
a lair kidney was very much amused 
d only go and call on mrs allen 
a he repeated 
a what a picture of intellectual poverty 
however when you sink into this abyss again you will have more to say 
you will be able to talk of bath and of all that you did here 
oh 
as 
i shall never be in want of something to talk of again to mrs allen or anybody else 
i really believe i shall always be talking of bath when i am at home again 
i do like it so very much 
if i could but have papa and mamma and the rest of them here i in poses i should be too ha y 
james coming my best brother is quite delightful 
and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already 
oh 
who can ever be creed of bath 
d a not those who bring such fresh feelings of every 9 norther abbey 
l 
sort to it as you do 
but papa and mamma and brothers and intimate friends are a good deal gone by to most of the frequent of bath 
and the honest relish of balls and plays and everyday sigh is past with them here their conversation closed 
the demands of the dance becoming now too importunate for a divided attention 
soon after their reaching the bottom of the set catherine perceived herself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the 
lookers-on immediately behind her partner 
he was a very handsome man of a commanding aspect past the bloom but not pasture vigour of life 
and with his eye still directed towards her she saw him presently address mr tilted in a familiar whisper 
confused by his notice and blushing from the fear of its being excited by something wrong in her appearance she turned away her head 
but while she did so the gentleman retreated and her anger coming nearer said i see that you guess what have just been asked 
that gentleman knows your name and you have a right to know his 
his general kidney my father catherine's answer was only 
oh 
a but it was an 
oh i expressing everything needful 
attention to his words and perfect reliance on their truth 
with real interest and strong admiration‘did her eye now follow the general as he moved through the crowd and a how handsome a family they are 
2 was her secret remarks in chatting with miss kidney before the evening concluded a new source of felicity arose to her 
she had never taken a country walk since her arrival in bath 
mim kidney to whom all the commonly frequented environs were familiar spoke of them in terms which made her all eagerness to know them too 
and on her 7s norther abbey 
openly flaring that she might and nobody to go with her it was proposed the brother and sister that they should join in a w k tome morning or other 
d i shall like it she cried beyond anything in the world 
and do not let us put it of let us go to-morrow a thin wan readily agreed to with only 30 of miss tilney’t that it did not rain which ca cringe wan tune it would not 
at twelve o'clock they were to call for her in plenty street and a remember twelve o'clock was her parting coach to her new friend 
of her other her older her more established friend isabella of whose reality and worth the had enjoyed a fortnight experience the namely law anything during the evening 
yet though longing to make her acquainted with her ha pinch the cheerfully submitted to the which of mr a lens which took them rather early away and her spirit danced within her no she danced in her chair all the way home 
a culprit 3 
he now brought a very over-looking morning 
the sun making only a few efforts to appear 
and catherine augury from it everything most favourable to her wishes 
a bright morning so early in the year the allowed would generally turn to rain 3 but a cloud one foretold improvement an the day advanced 
he a lied to mr allen for conversation of her hope but r allen not having his own skin and barometer about him declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine 
she applied to mrs allen and 421 allen opinion wan more five 
d she had no doubt in the world of its being a very one day if the clouds would only go off and the fun in out at about eleven o'clock however a w speck 
of norther abbey 
3 mall ruin upon the windows caught catherine's watchful eye and a oh dear 
i do believe it will be wet broke from her in a most desponding woe 
d i thought how it would be a laid mrs allen 
d no walk for me to-day 2 sighed catherine 
a but eh 
a it may come to nothing or it may hold up one twelve 2 perhaps it may 
but then my dear it will be so dirty 2 3 
that will not signify 
i never mind dirt 
a o 2 lied her friend v lucidly d i know on never mind-en.” cry p y y after a short pause 2 it comes on faster and faster 
said catherine as the mode watching at a window 
a so it does indeed 
if it keeps ruining the streets will be very wet 2 there on four umbrellas up already 
how i hate the eight often umbrella 
a they are disagreeable things to carry 
i would much rather take a chair at any time a it was such a nice looking morning 
i felt so convinced it would be dry 
a any body would have thought so indeed 
there will be very few people in the pump-room if it rains all the morning 
i hope mr allen will put on his great coat when he goes but i dare say he will not for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a great coat 
i wonder he should dislike it it must be to comfortable 
the rain continued fast though not heavy 
cathy 
crime went every live minute to the clock threatening on each return that if it still kept on raining another eve minutely the would give up the matter no hopeless 
the clock muck twelve and it will minded b you will not be able to go my dear 
i do not quite despair yet 
i shall not gin it up i 
4 norther abbey 
till a quarter after twelve 
this in just the time day for it to clear up and i do think it looks a little lighter 
there it it twenty minutes after twelve and now i 1801 give it up entirely 
oh 
that we lad inch weather here as they had at dolphin or at lent in husband and the south of f move the night that poor st auburn died 
— 
such heantiﬁxl weather 
at half past twelve when catherine anxious attention to the weather was over and she could no longer claim an merit from its amazement the sky began voluntary y to clear 
a gleam of sunshine took her quite surprised 
he looked round the clouds were parting and she instantly returned to the window to watch over and encourage the happy appearance 
ten 
minutes more made it certain that a his hat afternoon would succeed and justine the opinion of my allen who had always thought it would clear up 
but whether catherine might still expect her friends whether there had not been too much rain for mint kidney to venture must eat be a question 
it was too dirty for us allen to accompany her husband to the pump-room he accordingly set off by himself and catherine had barely watch him down the meet when her notice was claimed by the approach of the same two open carriage containing the same three peor lie that had surprised her to much a few mornings cask 
a isabella my brother and mr hope i declare 
they are coming for me perhaps 
but i shall not go 
i can not go indeed 
for you know mix kidney may still call mr allen agreed toil john there was noon with them and his voice war with them yet sooner for on the stain he was calling out tories morlnndtohequiok

and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle took a it is very odd 
but i suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk and well they might for i never saw so much dirt in my life

you could no more walk than you could by 
it has not been to dirty the whole winter 
it in rude deep everywhere isabella corroborated it 
a my dearest catherine you can not form an idea of the dirt 
come you must go 
you can not refuse going now a should like to see the castle 
but may we go all over it 
may we go up every miracle and into every suite of room 2 yes yes 
every hole and corner 
a but then if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is drier and call by and by 
a d make yourself easy there in no danger of that 
noxrnrmcnn essay 
77 for i heard kidney following to a man who was just nag by on horseback that they were going as far as nick rock when i will 
shall i go mrs allen 
a just as you please my dear a mrs allen you must persuade her to go was the general cry 
my allen was not inattentive to it 
a well my dear said she d suppose you go 
and in two minutes they were of 
catherine feelings as she got into the carriage were in a very unsettled state divided between regret for the loss of one great pleasure and the hope of soon enjoying another almost its equal in degree however unlike in kind 
she could not drink the times had acted quite well by her in so readily giving up their engagement without sending her any message of excuse 
it was now but an hour later than the time fixed on for the beginning of their walk 
and in spite of what she had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the course of that hour she could not from her own observation help drinking that they might have gone with verylittle inconvenience 
to feel herself slighted by them was very painful 
on the other hand the delight of exploring an alice like dolphin as her fancy represented b size castle to be was such a counterpoises of good as might console her for almost any thing 
they passed briskly down pungency street and 
through aura plane without the exchange of many words 
there talked to his horse and she meditated by turns on broken promises and broken arches phantoms and false hanging s illness and trap-door 
as they entered argue buildings however she was mused by this address from her companion who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by 2 b c who 2 where 
b c on the right-hand pavement she must be almost 7s helmsman anon 
out of right now catherine looked round and iv minx kidney leaning on her brother am walking slowly down the street 
she saw them both looking back at her 
c to stop mr hope 4 the impatiently cried it ll mien volney 
it it indeed 
how could you tell me they were gone 
stop 
up i will get out thin moment and go to them 
but to what purpose did the appeal 
there only lashed his home into a brick trot 
the stillness who had soon cease to look after her were in a moment out of light round the corner of laurel place and in another moment the wax herself whisked into the market place 
still however and during the length of another street the entreated him to 
up 31 etc mr those i can not our 
will not go 
ii 
i mint go rckrﬁllﬁu tillie 
g but mr there only laughed smacked his whip encouraged hire none made odd noises and drove on 
and catherine angry and vexed an the wan having no power of getting away was obliged to give up the point and submit 
her reproaches however were not learned 
how could you deceive me so mr hope 
how could you i that you saw them driving up the london road i would not have had it happen so for the world 
they must think it to mange no rude of me to go by them too without saying a word 
you do not know how vexed i am 
i shall have no pleasure at lintons nor in anything else 
i had rather ten thousand times rather get out now and walk back to them 
how could you say you saw them driving out in a portion 
there defended himself very neatly declared he had never seen two men so much alike in his life and would hardly give up the point of in having been kidney himself 
their drive even when this subject was over was not likely to be very agreeable 
catherine complacency was no longer what it had been in their former norther abbey 
7th aiming 
she listened reluctantly and her replies were short 
blame castle remained her only comfort 
towards that she still looked at intervals with pleasure 
though rather than be disappointed of the promised walk and especially rather than be thought ill of the times she would willingly have given up i the happiness which its walls could supply the happiness of a progress through a long suite of lofty rooms exhibiting the remains of magnificent furniture though now for many years deserted the happiness of being stopped in their way along narrow winding vaults by a 
low grated door 
or even of having their lamp their only lamp 
extinguished by a sudden gust of wind and of being left in total darkness 
in the meanwhile they proceeded on their journey without any mischance and were within view of the town of keynsharn when a halloo from moran who was behind them made his friend pull up to know what was the matter 
the others then came close enough for conversation 
and moaned said 2 we had better go back there 
it is too late to go on to-day 
your sister thinks so as well as i 
we have been exactly an hour coming from paltered street very little more than seven miles 
and i suppose we have at least eight more to go 
it will never do 
we set out s go deal too late 
we had much better put it on till another day and turn round 
a it is all one to me replied hope rather angrily 
and instantly turning his horse they were on their way back to bath 
if your brother had not got such a d 
beast to drive a said he soon afterwards 2 we might have done it very well 
my horse would have trotted to linton within the hour if left to himself and i have aim broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed brokenwinded jade pace 
morning is s fool for not keeping a horse and gig of hi own so norther abbey 
d no he is not a said catherine warmly 
for 
am sure he could not afford it 
e and why can not be afford it 
b c because he has not money enough c and whose fault is that 
b c nobody that i know of 
there then said something in the loud incoherent way to which he had often recourse about its being a d 
— 
thing to be miserable 
and that if people who rolled in money could not a odd things he did not know who could which catherine did not even endeavour to understand 
dean appointed of what was to have been the consolation for her first disappointment she was less and less disposed either to be agreeable herself or to and her companion so 
and they returned to paltered street without her sparkling twenty words 
as she entered the house the 
footman told her that a gentleman and lady had called and inquired for her a few minutes after her setting off 
that when he told them she was gone out with mr tore the lady had asked whether any message had been left for her and on his saying no 
had felt for a card but said she had none about her and went away 
pondering over these heartbreaking tidings catherine walked slowly upstairs 
at the head of them she was met by mr allen who on hearing the reason of their speedy return said i am glad your brother had so much sense 
i am glad you are come back 
it was a strange wild scheme they all spent the evening together at harpers 
catherine was disturbed and out of spirits 
but isabella seemed to and a pool of commerce in the fate of which she shared by private partners with moran i very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at chiffon 
her satisfaction too in not being at the lower rooms was spoken more than once 
a how northangbr abbey 
3 i pity the poor creatures that are going there 
how glad i am that i am not among them 
i wonder whether it will be a full ball or not 
they have not begun dancing yet 
i would not be there for all the world 
it is so delightful to have an evening now and then to one self 
i dare say it will not be a very good hall 
i know the milcher will not be there

but i dare say mr moran you long to be at it do not you 
i am sure you do 
well pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you 
i dare say we could do very well without you but you men think yourselves of such consequence catherine could almost have accused isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her ioitovii is very little did they appear to dwell on her mind and so very inadequate was the comfort she offered

chapter 31 
a fallen a said catherine the next morning a will there be any harm in my calling on its kidney to-day 
i shall not be easy 3 i have explained everything a go b all means my dear 
only put on a white gown 
miss til always wears white catherine cheer lay complied 
and being properly equipped was more in agent than ever to be at the pump-room that she might inform herself of general tiles lodgings 
for though she believed they were in wilson street she was not certain of the house and mrs alleys wavering convictions only made it more doubtful 
to wilson street she was directed 
and having made herself perfect in the number hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit explain her conduct and be forgiven tripping lightly through the churchyard and resolutely turning away her eyes that she might not be obliged to see he 
beloved isabella and her dear family who she ha reason to believe were in a shop hard by 
she reached the home without any impediment looked at the number knocked at the door and inquired for miss kidney 
the man believed miss kidney to be at home but was not quite certain 
would she be pleased to send up her name 
she gave her card 
in a few minutes the servant returned and with a look which did not quite confirm his words said he had been mistaken for that miss tile had walked out 
catherine with a blush of mortification left the house 
she felt almost persuaded that miss kidney war at home and too much offended to admit her 
and as she retired down the street could not withhold one glance at the drawing-room windows in expectation of seeing norther abbey 
83 her there but no one appeared at them 
at the bottom of the street however she looked back again and then not at a window but issuing from the door she aw miss kidney herself 
she was followed by gentleman whom catherine believed to be her father and they turned up towards edgar s buildings 
catherine in dee modification proceeded on her way 
she could most be angry herself at such angry civility 
but she checked the restful sensation she remembered her own ignorance 
she knew not how such an offence as hers might be clasped by the laws of worldly politeness to what a degree of forgiveness it might with propriety lad nor to what rumours of rudeness in return it might justly make her admirable 
dejected and tumbled she had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theatre that night 
but it must be confessed that they were not of iron continuance 
for she soon recollect in the first p ace that she was without any excuse for staying at home 
and in the second that it was a play the wanted very much to see 
to the theatre accordingly they all went 
no tiles appeared to plague or please her 
she feared that amongst the many perfection of the family a fondness for plays was not to be ranked but perhaps it was because they were habituated to the inner rforrnances of the london age which she knew on aabella’s authority rendered everything else of the kind 
quite horrid she was not deceived in her own expression of pleasure the comedy so well suspended her care that no one observing her during the first four acts would have supposed she had any wretched about her 
on the beginning of the fifth however the sudden view of mr henry tile and his father joining a party in the opposite box recalled her to anxiety and distress 
the stage could no longer excite genuine merriment no longer keep her whole attention 
every other look upon an average was 84 common sunny 
directed towards the o positive box 
and for the space of two entire scenes did she thus watch hen kidney without being once able to catch his eye 
o longer could he he s of indifference for a play 
his notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes 
at length however he did look towards her and he bowed but such a bow 
no smile no continued observances attended it his eyes were immediately returned to their former direction 
catherine was restlessly miserable 
she could almost have run round to the box in which he sat and forced him to hear her explanation 
feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her 
instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation 
instead of ruddy resolving in conscious innocence to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation and to enlighten him on the post only by avoiding his sight or flirting with somebody else she took to herself all the shame of conduct or at least of its appearance and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause 
the play concluded the curtain fell 
henry kidney was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto eat but his father remained and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box 
she was right in a few minutes he appeared and making his way through the then thinning rows spoke with like calm politeness to mrs allen and her friend 
not with such calmness was he answered by the latter 
a oh mr kidney i have been unite wild to speak to you and make my apologize 
ou must have thought me so rude 
but indeed it was not my own fault 
was it mrs allen 2 did not they tell me that mr tile and his sister were gone out in s pattens together 
and then what could i do 
but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you 
now had not i mrs allen 3 a flag a nil i northa‘nger new 
85 2 my dear you tumble my gown c was mrs alleys 
31 
er assurance however standing sole as it did was not thrown away 
it brought a more cordial more natural smile into his countenance and he replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve 2 we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a peasant walk after our passing you in argue street 
on were so kind as to look back on purpose 
a but indeed i did not wish you a p peasant walk i never thought of such a thing 
but i begged mr hope so earnestly to stop 
i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you 
now mrs allen did not oh 
you were not there 
but indeed i did 
and if mr hope would only have stopped i would have jumped out and run after you is there a henry in the world who could be insensible to such declaration 
henry pitney at least was not 
with a yet sweeter smile he said everything that need be said of his sisters concern regret and dependence on catherine honour 
oh do not say miss kidney was not angry 2 cried catherine because i know she was 
for she would not see me this morning when i called 
i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it 
i was hurt but i was not aﬂ'ronted 
perhaps you did not know i had been there i was not within at the time but i heard of it from elegance and she has been wishing ever since to see you to england the reason of such civility 
but perhaps i can of it as well 
it was nothing more than that my father 
they were just preparing to walk out and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put all made a point of her being denied 
that was all i do assure you 
she was very much vexed and meant so make her apology as soon as possible 
8d norther abbey 
catherine s mind was greatly eased by thin information yet a something of solicitude remained from which sprang the following question thoroughly ardent in itself though rather distressing to the gentleman 2 but mr kidney why were you less generous than your litter 
if the felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be only a mistake why ehould‘jou he to ready to take offence 
b c me 
i take offence 
b c nay i am sure by your look when you came into the box you were angry d i an i i could have no right 
a well nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face he replied by asking her to make room for him and talking of the play 
he remained with them some time and wan only too agreeable for catherine to be contented when he went away 
before they parted however it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken at man at possible 
and setting aside the misery of his quitting their box the was upon the whole left one of the happiest creature in the world 
while talking to each other the had observed with some surprise that john those who wan never in the same part of the house for ten minutes together was engaged in conversation with general kidney 
and the felt something more than surprise when she thought 
she could perceive herself the object of their attention and discourse 
what could they have to may of her 
she feared general kidney did not like her appearance 
she found it was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter rather than postpone his own walk a few minutes 
a how came mr hope to know your father 
a wan her anxious inquiry at the cited them out to her companion 
he knew nothing about it 
norther abbey 
3 but his father like every military man had a very large a chance 
hen the entertainment was over there came to skirt them in getting out 
catherine wan the immediate object of his gallantry 
and while they waited in the lobby for a chair he prevented the inquiry which had travelled from her heart almost to the tip of her tongue by king in a comequemial manner whether the had seen him talking with general kidney 
a he is a one old fellow upon my soul 
stout active 
look as young at fall in 
i have a great regard for him i from you 
a gentleman-like good sort of fellow at ever lived a but how came on to know him 2 b c know him 
here are few people much about lawn that i do not know 
i have met him for ever at the hereford 
and i knew his face again to-day the moment he came into the billiard-room 
one of the belt players we have bathe 
bye 
and we had a little touch together though i was almost afraid of him at link 
the odds were live to four against me 
and if i had not made one of the clearest strokes that perhaps ever wan made in this world 
i took his ball exactly 
but i could not make you understand it without a table however i it 
beat him 
a very one fellow 
at rich as a few 
i should like to dine with him 
i daresay he give famous dinners 
but what do you think we have been talking of 3 you 
yes by heaven 
and the general think you the honest girl in both a oh nonsense 
how can you nay to e b c and what do you think i laid 
a lowering lull voice 
well done general 2 laid ii d i am quite of ur win a ere catherine who was much let gratified by admiration than general tilney'l was not sorry to be called away by r allen 
there however would are her to her chair and till the entered it continued 88 won-rumour essay 
the same kind of delicate latter in spite of her entreating him to have done 
that general kidney instead of disliking should admire her was very delightful 
and she joyfully thought that there was not one of the family whom she need now fear to meet 
the evening had done more 
much more for her than could have been expected chapter 31 
monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday and saturday have now passed in review before the reader 
the events of each day its hopes and fears mortiﬁcstions and pleasures have been separated stated and the pangs of sunday only now remain to be described and close the week 
the cliffs scheme had been deferred not relinquished 
and on the anemones crescent of this day it was brought forward again 
in a private consultation between isabella and james the former of whom had particularly set her heart upon going and the latter no less noxious placed his upon pleasing her it was agreed that divided the weather were fair the party should take place on the following morning 
and they were to set off very early in order to be at home in good time 
the affair thus determined and hopes approbation secured catherine only remained to be apprised of it 
she had left them for a few minutes to speak to miss kidney 
in that interval the plan was completed and as soon as she came again her agreement was demanded 
but instead of the gay acquiescence expected by isabella catherine looked grave was very sorry but could not go 
the engagement which ought to have kept her from joining in the former attempt would make it imnoumsnonn abbey 
89 possible for her to accompany them now 
she had that moment settled with miss trained to take their promised walk to-morrow 
it was quite determined and she would not upon any account retract 
but that she mum and could retract wan instantly the eager cry of both the hope 
they must go to linton to-morrow they would not go without her it would be anything to put of a mere walk for one day longer and they would not hear of a refusal 
catherine was distressed but not subdued 
a do not urge me isabella 
i am engaged to miss kidney 
i can not go this availed nothing 
the same arguments assailed her again 
she must go she should go and they would not hear of a refusal 
it wouldbeaoeasytotell mile tilneythatyouhad just been reminded of a prior engagemengand must only beg to put oil 
the walk till tuesday no it would not be easy 
i could not do it 
there has been no prior engagement but isabella became only more and more urgent 
calling on her in the most affectionate manner 
addressing her by the most endeavouring names 
she was sure her dearest sweetest catherine would not seriously refused such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so dearly 
she knew her beloved catherine to have no feeling a heart connect a temper to he so easilypersuaded b those she loved 
but all in vain 
catherine felt hence f to be in the right wood though pained by such tender such battering application could not allow it to induce her 
isabella then tried another method 
she reached her with having more affection for miss irene though the had known her so little i while than for her best and oldest friends 
with being grown cold and indifferent in about towards herself 
d i cannut help being jealous catherine when i see myself hatred for strange 
i who love you so excessively 
hen once my affection are placed it in not in the g 9 norther abbey 
power of anything to change them 
but i believe my feelings are stronger than any body s 
i am sure they tremor strong for my own peace 
and to see myself supplemented in your friendship'llsy strangers does cut me mother quick o 
these lanes seem to swallow up everything else catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind 
was it the part of a friend thus to expose her feelings to the notice of others 
isabella appeared to her ungenerous and selfish regardless of everything but her own gratification 
these painful ideas crossed her mind though she said nothing 
isabella in the meanwhile had applied her handkerchief to her eyes 
and morals miserable at such a sight could not help saying nay catherine i think you can not stand out any longer now 
the sacrilege is not much 
and to oblige such a friend i shall think you quite unkind if you still refuse 
this was the first time of her brother s openly sidling against her 
and anxious to avoid his displeasure she proposed a compromise 
if they would only ut off their scheme till tuesday which they might y do as it depended only on themselves she could go with them and everybody might then be satisfied 
but a no no no i a was the immediate answer 
that could not be for who did not know that he might not go to town on t y 
catherine was sorry but could do no more 
and a short silence ensued 
which was broken by isabella who in a voice of cold resentment 
said very well then there is an end of the party 
if catherine does not go i can not 
i can not be the chin woman 
i would not upon any account in the words do so improper a thing a catherine you must go a said james 
a but wh can not mr hope drive one of his other sisters 
i 1100 say either of them would like to go 
northangir abbey 
9 
d thank e 2 cried hope 
but i did not come to bath to ve my sisters about and look like i fool 
no if you do not go d 
me if i do 
i only go for the sake of driving you 2 that is a compliment which gives no pleasure but her words were lost on those who had turned abruptly away 
2 the three others still continued together walking in a most uncomfortable manner to poor catherine 
sometimes not a word was said sometimes she was again attacked with supplications or reproaches and her arm was still linked within isabella though their hearts were at war 
at one moment she was softened at other irritated 
always distressed but always steady 
i did not think you had been so obstinate catherine a said james 
you were not used to be so hard to persuade 
you once were the kindest bad-tempered of m sisters 
hope i an not less so now a she replied very feeling 
but indeed i can not go 
if i am wrong i am doing what i believe to be right 
i suspect 2 mid umbrella in a low voice a there is no real struggle gather-he’s heart swelled 
she drew away harm and isabella made no opposition 
thus lasted a long ten minutes till they were again joined by ho who coming to them with s gayer look said 2 we i have settled the matter and now we may all go to-morrow with a safe conscience 
i have been to miss tile and made your excuses you have not 
a cried catherine 
d i have upon my soul 
left her this moment 
told her you had sent me to say that having just recollected a prior engagement of going to linton with us so-morrowélyou could not have the pleasure of walking with her tuesday 
she said very well tuesday 9 horn anger grey 
wasjustss convenient to her 
so there is an end of all our difficulties 
a pretty good thought of mine h 2 isabella s countenance was once more all smiles and good-humour and james too looked ha y again 
a most heavenly thought indeed 
now my sweet catherine all our distresses over 
you are honour 
my acquitted and we shall have a most delightful this will not do said catherine 
d i can not submit to this 
i must run after mine kidney directly and set her right isabella however caught hold of one hand those of the other 
and remonstrance poured in from all three 
even jewel was quite angry 
when everything was settled when miss kidney herself said that tuesday would suit her as well it was quite ridiculous quite absurd to make an further objection 
i do not care 
r there had no business to invent an such message 
if i had thou hit it right to ut it o i could have spoken to miss kidney myself 
his is on doing it in a rude way 
and how do i know that r horse has 
he may be mistaken again perhaps 
he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on friday 
let me go mr hope 
nelly do not hold meet those told her it would be in vain to go after the times they were turning the corner into bricks street when he had overtaken them and were at home by this time 
a then i will go after them said catherine 
whenever they are i will go after them 
it does not signify talking 
if i could not be persuaded into doing what thought wrong i never we be tricked into it 
and with these words she broke awn and hurried off 
there would have darted after her ut normandy with norther abbey 
3 held him 
let her go let her go she will go 
she is as obstinate as 
a hope i never finished the simile for it could hardly have been a proper one 
away walked catherine in great opinion as fast as the crowd would permit her fearful of being pursued yet determined to persevere 
as she walked she reflected on what had passed 
it was painful to her to disappoint and disperse them particularly to please her brother 
but she could not repent her resistance 
setting her own inclination apart to have failed a second time in her engagement to miss kidney to have reflected a promise voluntarily made only eve minutes before and on a false pretence too must have been wrong 
she had not been notwithstanding them on selfish principles alone she had not consulted merely her own gratification 
lem might have been ensured in some degree by the excursion itself by seeing blaze castle 
no she had attended to what was due to others and to her own character in their opinion 
her conviction of being right however was not sum i to restore her composure till she had spoken to as tiny she could not be at ease 
and quickening her pace when she got clear of the crescent 
she almost ran over the remaining ground till she gained the top of milton street 
so rapid had been her movements that in spite of the tiles advantage in the outset they were but just turning into their lodgings as she came within view of them 
and the servant still remaining at the open door she used only the ceremony saying that she must speak with miss kidney that moment and hurrying by him exceeded up stairs 
then opening the first door re her which ha ed to be the right she immediately found h in the drawing-room with general kidney his son and daughter 
a her explanation 
defective only in being 
from her 9 manger abbey 
irrigation of nerves sud shortness of breath 
no explanation at all was instantly given 
i am come in a great hurry 
it was all i mistake 
i never promised dogma 
i wldthemfrom the first i could not go 
i ran away in a great hurry to explain it 
i did not care what you thought of me 
i would not stay for the servant 
the business however though not perfectly emaciated by this speech soon ceased to he a puzzle 
catheﬁnetfound that john those bad given the message 
and miss tile had no scruples in owning herself greatly surprised by it 
but whether her brother had still exceeded her in resentment catherine though she indecisively addressed herself as much to one as to the other in her indication had no means of knowing 
whatever might have been felt before her arrival her eager declaration immediately made every look and sentence as friendly as she could desire 
the affair thus happily settled she was introduced ll miss kidney to her father and received by him wi such ready such delicious politeness as recalled harpers information to her mind and made her think with pleasure that he might he sometimes depended on 
to such anxious attention was the enemies civility carried that not aware of her extraordinary stiffness in entering the house he was quite angry with the servant whose neglect had reduced her to o the door of the a moment herself 
what did william mean by it 
e should make a point of inquiring into the matter and if catherine had not most warmly asserted his innocence it seemed likely that william would lose the favour of his master for ever if not his place by her rapidity 
sitting witches usrterofsnhour she nqrthanger abbey 
3 prized by general tiles asking her if she would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest the day with her 
miss kidney added her own wishes 
catherine was greatly obliged 
but it wan quite out of her power mr and mrs allen would expect her back every moment 
the general declared he could say no more 
the claims of mr and mrs allen were not to be superseded 
but on some other day he trusted when longer notice could be given they would not refuse to re her to her friend a oh no 
catherine was sure they would not have the least objection and she should have great pleasure in coming 
the general attended her himself to the street door saying everything gallant as they went down stairs admiring the elasticity of her walk which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her dancing and making her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld when they parted 
catherine delighted by all that had passed proceeded gain to paltered street walking as she concluded with great elasticity though she had never thought of it before 
she reached home without seeing anything more of the offended party 
and now that she had been triumphant throughout had carried her point and was secure of her walk she began as the butter of her spirits subsided to doubt whether she had been perfectly right 
a sacrifice was always noble 
and if she had given way to their entreaties she should have been spared the distressing idea of friend a brother angry and a scheme of great ha uneasy to both destroyed perhaps through her means 
of ease her mind and ascertain by the o union of an unprejudiced person what her own conduct d really been she took occasion to mention before mr allen the half-veiled scheme of her brother and the horses for the following day 
mr allen caught at it directly 
well a said he and doyouthinkofgoingmo 
go nonmnuonn ennui 
no 
i had just engaged myself walk with miss kidney before they told me of it 
and therefore you know i could not go with them could i p d no certainly not 
and i am glad you do not think of it 
those schemes are not at all the thing 
young men and women driving about the country in open carriages 
now and then it in very well 
but going to in and public places together 
it is not right 
and i wonder men hope would allow it 
i am glad you do not think of going 
i am sure mr farmland would not be pleased 
mrs allen are not you of my way of thinking 
do not you think there kind of projects objectionable 
a yes very much so indeed 
open carriage are nuts things 
a clean gown is not ever minutes wear in them 
you are pleased getting in and getting out 
and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction 
i hate an open carriage myself i know you do 
but that not the question 
do not on think it has an odd appearance if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men to whom they are not even related 
d ye my dear a very odd appearance indeed 
i not bear to see it 
dear madam 2 cried catherine then why did not you tell me so before 
i am sure if i had known it to be in proper i would not have gone with mr tore at l 
but i always hoped you would tell me if you thought i warn doing wrong c and so i should my dear you may depend on it 
for as i told mrs moran at parting i would always do the heat for you in my power 
but one mun not be over particular 
young pen les will be your people as your good mother aye home for you know wanted you when we am came not to buy that digged muslin 
but you would 
young people do not like to be always thwarted horn anger abbey 
9th 2 but this was something of real consequence 
and ideas notthinkyou wouldhavefonnd me hard unpermade.” as far as it has gone hitherto there is no harm done said mr allen 
e and i would only advise you my dear not to go out with mr there any more that is just what i was going to by a added his wife 
catherine relieved for herself felt uneasy for isabella 
and after a moment s thought asked mr allen whether it would not be both proper and kind in her to write to miss hope and explain the indoor of which she must be as insensible as herself 
for she considered that isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to linton the next day in spite of what had passed 
mr allen however discouraged her from doing any such thing 
b you had better lave her alone my dear she is old enough to know what she is about and if not has a mother to advise her 
mrs there is too indulgent beyond s doubt 
but however you had better not interfere 
she and your brother chose to go and you will be only getting ill-will 
catherine submitted 
and though sorry to think that isabella should be doing wrong felt greatly relieved by mr alleys approbation of her own conduct and truly rejoiced to be preserved by his advice from the danger o falling into such an error herself 
her escape from being one of henry to linton was now an escape indeed 
for what would the illness have thought of her if she had broken her promise to them in order to do what was wrong in itself if she had been guilty of one breach of propriety only to enable her to be guilty of another

he next morning was fair and catherine almost expected another attack from the assembled nay 
with mr allen in no port her she felt no dread of the event 
but she would gladly be spared a nest where victory itself was pain and was heartily rejoiced therefore at neither seeing nor hearing anything of them 
the till called for her at the appointed time and no new difficulty arising no sudden recollection no unexpected summons no impertinent intrusion to discover their mum my heroine was most unnaturally able to fulfil her engagement though it was made with the hero himself 
they determined on walking round beeches cliff that noble hill whose beautiful verdure and hanging caprice render it no striking on object from almost every opening in bath 
d i never look at it a said catherine as they walked along the side of the river a without thinking of the south of france

thank you cleaner 
a most honorable testimony 
you see miss moran the injustice of your suspicions 
here was i in my scenes to get on meaning to wait only eve minutes for my sister 
breaking the promise i had made of reading it aloud and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part by running away with the volume which you are to observe was her own particularly her own 
i am proud when i reflect on it and i think it must establish me in your good opinion d i very glad to hear it indeed 
and now i shall never be ashamed of liking dolphin myself 
but i really thought before young men despised novels amazing 
a it is amazing it may well snuggest mast if they do for they read nearly as many as women 
i must have read hundreds and hundreds

can you 
a northern gear abbey 
10 
a yes i am fond of history i wish i were too 
i read it a little as duty 
but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me 
the quarrels of ropes and kings with wars or silences in every page 
the men all so good for nothing and hardlfyzzny women at all it is very tiresome 
and yet i m think it odd that it should be so dull for a great deal of it must be invention 
the hers that are put into the heroes mouths their thoughts and designs the chief of all this must he invention and invention is what delights me in other looks a historian you think a said miss kidney 2 are not happy their rights of fancy 
they display imagination without raising interest 
i am fond of history and am very well contented to take the false with the true 
in the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records which may be as much depended on i conclude as anything that does not actually pass under one own observation 
and as for the little embellishment you speak of they are embellishment and i like them as such 
if a speech be well drawn up i read it with pleasure by whomsoever it may be made and probablyiwith much greater if the production of mr home or r robert than if the amir words of csractacus africa or alfred the rear 
b you are fond of history 
and so are mr allen and my father 
and i have two brothers who do not dislike it 
so man instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable at this rate i shall not pity the writers of history any longer 
if people like to read heirlooms its allverywell 
but to be at so much trouble in calling great volumes which as i used to think nobody would willingly ever look into to he labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls to 
norther abbey 
always a muck meunhnrdfate 
and though know it in very right and necessary i have often wondered at the person courage that could sit down on purpose to do it that little boy and girl should be tormented said henry is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilised state can deny 
but in behalf of our most distinguished historian i must observe that they might well be offended at being an aged tar 
have no higher aim 
and that by their to aid and let they are costly well qualified to torment readers of the most a fancied reason and mature time of life 
i use the verb c to torment a an i observed to be your own method instead of to construct a supposing them not be now admitted an synonimoue.” 
you think me foolish to call instruction 2 torment 
but if you had been as much mad as myself to hear poor little children brit learning their letter and then luring to spell if you had ever seen how stupid they car 
be for a whole morning together and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it an i am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home you would allow that to torment and to inflict 
might sometime be used an cynonimoue words 
very probably 
but historian are not unaccountable for the difficulty of learning to read 
and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very mere very intense application ma perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very we worth while to be tormented for two or three year of one life for the lake of being able to read all the nest of it 
consider if reading had not been taught men sandcliff would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all 
catherine muted 
and a very warm panegyric from her on that lady merited cloud the subject 
the 10 7 r t norther abbey 
1801 chimneys were soon engaged in another on which the had nothing to say 
they were viewing the country with the eyes of persons accustomed to drawing 
and decided on its incapability of being formed into pictures with all the eagerness of real taste 
here catherine was quite lost 
she knew nothing drawing 
nothing of taste 
and she listened to them with an attention which brought her little proud for they talked in phrases which conveyed scarcely any idea to her 
the little which she could understand however appeared to contradict the very few notions she had entertained on the matter before 
it seemed as if a good view were no longer to be taken from the top of on high hill and that a clear blue sky was no lone er a proof of a one day 
she was he y ashamed of her ignorance 
a misplaced shame 
where people wish to attach they should always be ignorant 
to come with a well-informed mind is to come with an inability of ministering to the vanity of others which a sensible person would always wish to avoid 
a woman especially if she have the misfortune of knowing any thing should conceal it as well as she can 
the advantages of natural folly in a beautiful girl have been already set forth by the capital pen of a sister author 
and to her treatment of the subject i will only add injustice to men that though to the larger and more trifling part of the sex imbecility in females is a great advancement of their personal charms there is a portion of them too reasonable and no well-informed themselves to desire anything more in woman than ignorance 
but catherine did not know her own advantages 
did not know that a good-looking 17 with an affectionate heart and a very ignorant mind can not fail of attracting a clever young man unless circumstances are particularly untoward 
in the present instance the confessed and lamented her want of knowing norther abbey 
ledge 
declared that she would give anything in the world to be able to draw 
and a lecture on the picturesque immediately followed in which his instructions were so clear that she soon to see beauty in everything admired by him 
and her action was so earnest that he became perfectly satisfied of her having a great deal of natural taste 
live talked of fore-grounds distances and second distances 
side-screens and peeped lives 
lights and shades 
and catherine was so hopeful a scholar that when they gained the top of benches clim she voluntarily rejected the whole city of bath as unworthy to make part of a landscape 
delighted with her progress and fearful of worrying her with too much wisdom at once henry suffered the subject to decline and by an easy transition from a piece of 
rocky fragment and the withered oak which he had placed near it summit 
to oaks in general 
to forests the enclosure of them waste lands crown lands and government 
he shortly found himself arrived at attics 
and from attics it was an step to evince 
the general pause which succeeded his short dilquiliﬁon on the state of the nation was put an end to by catherine who in rather a solemn tone of voice uttered these words a i have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in london miss kidney to whom this was chiefly addressed was startled and hastily 
indeed 
and of what nature 
2 that i do not know nor who is the author 
i have only heard that it is to he more horrible turn things we have met with ye a good heaven 
where could you bar of arch a thin 
a sea particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter london yesterday 
it is to be uncommonly dreadful 
i shall expect murder and'everything of the kind 4 
norther abbey 
10th b you with astonishing composure 
but i hope your ends accounts have been exaggerated 
and if such a design is known beforehand ropers measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect 
government d said henry endeavouring not to smile 2 neither desires not dares to interfere in such matters 
there must be murder and government cares not how much the ladies stared 
he laughed and added a come shall i make you understand each other or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can 
no i will be noble 
i will prove myself a man no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head 
i have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours 
perhaps the qualities of women are neither sound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen 
perhaps they may want observation discernment judgment 
are genius and wit 
miss moran do not mind what he says 
but have the goodness to satisfy me as no thisdresdful riot a riot 
— what riot 
b c my dear clear the riot is only in your own brain 
the confusion there is scandalous 
miss marian has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out in three duodecimo volumes two hundred and seventy pages in each with a frontispiece to the rest of two tombstone and a lantern 
do you understand 
and you miss moran 
my star 6d sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions 
ou talked of expected honor in london 
and instead of instantly conceiving as any rational creature would have done that such words could relate only to a circling library 
she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men dog normans annum 
assembling in st george fields 
the bank attacked the tower threatened the meets of london bowing with blood a attachment of the 11th light lagoons the hopes of the nation called up from southampton to quelling the instruments and the gallant captain frederick tilted in the moment of charging at the head of his troop knocked off his horse by a brickbats from an upper window 
forgive her stupidity 
the fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman 
but she is by no means a simpleton in general catherine looked grave 
e and now henry d said miss kidney that you have made us understand each other you may as well make miss moran understand yourself unless you mean to have her think you intolerable rude to your sister and a great brute in you opinion of women in general 
miss moran is not used to your add says i shall he most happy to make her better acquainted with them 
no doubt 
but that is no explanation of the present what am i to do 
you know what you ought to do 
clear your character handsomely before her 
tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women 
miss moran i think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world especially of those whoever they may be with whom i happen to be in company 
that is not enough 
be more serious 
a miss moran no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than i do 
in my opinion nature has given them so much that they never and it use a use more than half 
2 we shall get nothing more serious from him now miss moran 
he is not in a sober mood 
but i korthanger abbey 
oh assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all or an unkind one of me it was no effort to catherine to believe that henry kidney could never be wrong 
his manner might sometimes surprise but his meaning must always be just 
and what she did not understand the was almost as ready to admire as what she did 
the whole walk was delightful and though it ended too soon its conclusion wasdelightfultoo 
her friends attended her into the house and miss kidney before they parted addressing herself with respectful form as much to mrs allen also catherine mentioned for the pleasure of her corn nay to dinner on the day after the next 
no edifice t was made on mrs alleys side and the only difficulty on catherine was in concealing the excess of her leisure 
the morning had passed away so chancing us to banish all her friendship and natural affection 
for no thought of isabella or axes crossed her mind during their walk 
when the chimneys were gone she became amiable again but she was amiable for some time to little effect 
mrs allen had no intelligence to give that could relieve her anxiety 
she had heard nothing of any of them 
towards the end of the morning however catherine having occasion for some indispensable yard of ribbon which must be bought without a moment delay walked out into the town and in bond street overtook the second miss hope as she was loitering towards edgar's buildings between two of the sweetest gilding the world who had been her dear friends all the morning 
from her she soon learned that the party to linton had taken place 
the set of 
at eight this morning said miss annie c and em tune i do not envy them theirdrive 
i think you sod i are farewell off be out of the scrape 
it must he the fullest thing in the world for there is not a soul it linton at this 10s nonmanoen new 
time of the 
belle went with your brother and john drove aerial catherine spoke the pleasure she really felt on hearing thin part of the amngernent 
a oh 
yet a rejoined the other a marriage is one 
she was quite wild to go 
she thought it won d be something very one 
i can not say i admire her taste 
and for my part i was determined from the durst not to go if they pressed me ever in much 
catherine a little doubtful of this could not help answering d i wiahayou could have gone too 
it in a pity you could not i go think you but it in quite a matter of indifference to me 
indeed i would not have gone on any account 
i wan saying no to family and social when you overtook up 
a catherine was still convinced 
but glad that anyone should have the friendship of an family and 3 sepia to console her the bade her adieu without much uneasiness and returned home pleased that the party had not been prevented by her refusing to join it and very heartily wishing that it might be too pleasant to allow either amen or isabella m resent her redatanca any longer 
chapter 19 
early the next day a note from isabella speaking peace and tenderness in every line and entreating the immediate presence of her friend on a matter of the utmost importance hastened catherine in the nap lent state of conscience and curiosity to edgar 
b c doings 
the two youngest miss three were by themselves in the parlour and on annie s quitting it to call her defer catherine took the opportunity of asking norther abbey 
1000 the other for tome particular of their yesterday's sty 
x“mariaderirud no greater plemrethnntoepeakofit 
and catherine immediately learned that it had been altogether the most delightful scheme in world that nobody could imagine how charming it had been and that it had been more delightful 
than an body could conceive 
such was the information of the rat eve minute 
the second unfolded thus much in detail that they had driven directly to the york hotel ate some sour and spoke an early dinner walked down to the room tasted the water and laid out some shillings in gaunter and spare 
thence adjourned to eat ice at a pastrycook and hurrying back to the hotel swallowed their dinner in haste to prevent being in the dark and then had a delightful drive back only the moon was not up and it rained a little and mr morland’a home was no tired he could hardly get it along 
catherine listened with heartfelt satisfaction 
it appeared that blame castle had never been thought of and as for all the rest there wan nothing to regret for half an instant 
marian s intelligence concluded with a tender excursion of pity for her sister annie whom the represented an ineupponably cross from being excluded the party 
d she will never forgive me i am sure 
but you know how could i help it 
john would have me go for he vowed he would not drive her because she had inch thick uncles 
i dare say the will notice in good humour again this month 
but i am determined i will not be cross 
it is not a little matter that put me out of temper 
isabella now entered the room with so eager a step and a look of web happy importance an engaged all her friend notice 
marian was without ceremony sent away and isabella morning catherine thus began 
i 10 horn anger all 
yes my dear catherine it is indeed 
your penetration has not deceived you oh that arch eye of yours 
it sees through everything catherine only by a look of wondering ignorance 
a nay my beloved 
friend a eondnmgd’the other compose young 
am amazing sit as a

let us sit down and talking comfort 
e and so you guessed it the moment you had my note 
sly creature 
oh 
dear catherine you alone who know my hem can judge of my present happiness 
your brother is the most charming of men 
only with i were more worthy of him 
but what will your excellent father and mother say 
oh heavens 
when i think of them i am so agitated 
catherine understanding began to awake 
an idea of the truth suddenly darted into her mind 
and with the natural blush o so new an emotion she cried out good heaven 
my dear isabella what do you mean 
can you 
can you really be in love with james 
a this hold surmise however she soon learnt comprehended but half the fact 
the anxious affection which she was accused of having continually watched in isabella every look and section had in the course of their yesterday's received the delightful confession of an e dual over 
her hurt and faith were alike engaged to arms 
never had catherine listened to anything so full of interest wonder and joy 
her brother and her friend en gal new to such circumstances the importance of it appeared unspeakably great and she contemplated it as one of those grand events of which the ordinary course of life can hard afford a return 
the strength of her feelings she could not express 
the nature of them however contented her friend 
the happiness of having such a sister was their northangir abbey 
l i l link effusion and the fair ladies mingled in embrace 
and ten of joy 
delighting however 82 catherine sincerely did in the parson of the confusion it rust be acknowledged that isa la far surpassed her in tender anticipation 
b you will be no infinitely dearer to me my catherine thpneitheranneormaria 
feel that i shall be to much more attached to my dear morland’e family than to my own 
this was a pitch of friendship beyond catherine 
b you are i like your dear brother continued isabella 2 that i quite domed on you the tint moment i saw you 
but no it always is with me the arm moment nettle everything 
the very link day that morlock came to us last christmas the very link moment i beheld him my heart was irrevocably gone 
i remember i wore my yellow gown with my hair done up in braided 
and when i came into the drawing-room and john introduced him i thought i never mew anybody so handsome before here catherine secretly acknowledge ed the power of love 
for though exceedingly fond of her brother and partial to all his endowments the had never in her life thought him handsome 
d i remember too mine andrew drank tea with up that evening and wore her price-coloured magnet 
and iii looked to heavenly that i thought your brother mun certainly fall in love with her 
i could not sleep a wink all night for thinking of it 
oh 
catherine the many sleepless night i have had on our brother account 10 i would not have you ruler ha f what i have done 
i am grown wretchedly thin i know 
but i will not pain you by describing my anxiety 
you have been enough of it 
i feel that i have betrayed myself perpetually 
lo unguarded in speaking of m partiality for the church 
but my secret i was way 
we would be safe with you i 120 norther abbey catherine felt that nothing could 
have been safer 
but ashamed of an ignorance little expected the dared no longer contest the point nor refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate sympathy as isabella chose to consider her 
her brother she found was preparing to set off with all speed to fuller to make known his situation and ask consent 
and here was a source of some real agitation m the mind of isabella 
catherine endeavoured to persuade her as she was herself persuaded that her father and mother would never oppose their sons wishes 
a it is impossible d said the e for parents to be more kind or more desirous of their children happiness 
i have no doubt of their commenting immediately 
d a midland says exactly the same 2 replied isabella 
and yet i dare not expect it 
my fortune will be so small 
they never can consent to it 
your brother who i hit marry anybody 
a ere catherine again discovered the force of love 
a indeed isabella you are too humble 
the dinner 
once of fortune can be nothing to signify 2 oh 
my sweet catherine in your generous heart i know it would signify nothing but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many 
as for myself i am sure i only wish our situations were reversed 
had i the command of millions were i mistress of the whole world your brother would be my only choice this charming sentiment recommended as much by sense as novelty gave catherine s most pleasing remembrance of all the heroes of her acquaintance 
and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than in uttering the grand ideas 
d i am sure they will consent c was her frequent declaration 
d i am sure they will be delighted with you 
a for my own part a mid isabella 2 my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in more would horn anger abbey 
3 be enough for me 
where people are really attached poverty itself in wealth grandeur i detest i would not scale in london for the universe 
a cottage in some retired villa e would be exactly 
there are some charming little 2 about richmond 2 richmond 
a cried catherine 
b you must settle near fuller 
you must be near us “lunsureishallbemieei-ableifwedonot 
if i can but be near you i shall be satisfied 
but this is idle talking 
i will not allow myself to think of torch things till we have your father never 
moaned says that sending it to-night to salisbury we may have it to-morrow 
to-morrow i know i shall never have courage to open the letter 
i know it will be the death of me a reverie succeeded thin conviction and when isabella spoke again it was to resolve on the quality of her wedding-tour 
their conference was put an end to by the anxious young lover himself who came to breathe his parting sigh before he set of for willie 
catherine wished to congratulate him but knew not what to say and her eloquence was only in her eyes 
from them however the i hit pon of speech shone out most expressive and arms could combine them with ease 
impatient for the realization of all that he hoped at home his adieu were not long 
and they would have been yet shorter had he not been frequently detained by the urgent enemies of his fair one that he would go 
twice was he called almost from the door by her eagerness to have him gone 
indeed moran i must drive you away 
consider how far on have to ride 
i can not hear to see you linger so 
pyonheaven’s sake waste no more time 
there go go 
i insist on it the two friends with hear now more united than ever wereimepnnbleforthe day 
and in scheme of i in norther abbey 
sternly happiness the hours dew along 
mrs hope and her son who were a united with everything and who seemed only to want r lowlands consent to consider isabella engagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for their family were allowed to in their counsel and add their quest 
of significant dock and mysterious expressions to all up the measure of curiosity to be raised in the nap edged younger sisters 
of catherine slim e feelings this and sorrow reserve seemed neither grin y meant nor consistency supported 
and its unkindness she would hardly have forlorn pointing out had its inconsistency been less their friend 
but ann and marian soon set her heart at use by the sagacity of their d i know what 3 c and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit a disciple of family ingenuity 
on one side in the mystery of an affected secret on the other of undefined discovery all equally acute 
catherine was with her friend again the next day endeavouring to support her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the delivery of the letters a neeght exertion 
for as the time of reasonable expectation drew near isabella became more and more desponding and before the letter arrived had worked herself into a suite of real distress 
but when it did come where could distress be found 
d i have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kind parents and am promised that everything in their power shall be done to forward my happiness a were the first three lines mud in one moment all was joyful security 
the brightest glow was instantly spread over isabella s centres 
all care and anxiety seemed removed her spirits became almost too high for continual and she called herself without scruple the happiest of mortals 
mrs shore with tears of joy embraced her du hers her son her visitor and could have embraced f the horthanger abbey 
i d inhabitants of bath with nu'efaetion 
her heart was overflowing with tender 
it was dear john c and dear catherine at every word 
dear ann and dear marian a mute immediately be made sharer in their felicity 
and two cents 
at once before the name of isabella were not more than that beloved child had now well earned 
john humour was no skulker in joy 
he not only bestowed on mr moran the high commendations of being one of the honest fellow in the world but were off many sentence in his raise 
the letter whence sprang felicity was short containing little more than this assurance of success 
and every particular we deferred till james could write again 
but for circular isabella could well afford m wait 
the n was come raised in mr lowlands promise he honour we pal god to make everything easy 
and by what mean their income wan to be formed whether landed property wet 
to be resigned or founded money made over was a matter in which her disinterested spirit took no concern 
she knew enough to feel secure of an honourable and ready establishment and her imagination took a rapid right over its intended felicitous 
she saw herself at the end of a few weeks the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance at fuller the envy of every valued old friend in partner with a carriage at her command a new name on her tickets and a brilliant exhibition of hoop rings on her in er 
hen the contents of the letter were entertained john those who had only waited its arrival to begin his journey to london prepared to set off a well minx lowland a said he on wending her alone in the parlour d i am come to bid you good-by catherine wished him a good journey 
without appearing to hear her he walked to the window dotted about hummed a tune and seemed wholly elf-occupied

he made no answer

after a minutes silence burst out with a a famous good thing this marrying scheme was my soul

that is kind of you however

i shall not forget it in a hurry 
but you have more good-natured and all that than anybody living i believe 
a monstrous deal of good-natured and it is not only good-natured but you have so much

and i am heartily glad to hear you say the name 
but i have a notion miss moran you and i think pretty much alike upon most mature 2 perhaps we may 
but it is more than i ever thought of 
and as to mark martyr to say the truth there are not many that i know my own mind about by love no more do i 
it is not my way to bother in brains with what does not concern me

i think kite you there 
if there is a good fortune on one side there can be no occasion for any on the other 
no mutter which has it so that there it enough 
hate the idea of one great fortune looking out or another 
and to marry for money i think the wicked thing in existence 
good day 
we shall be very glad to see you at fuller whenever it is convenient and aware she went 
it wan not in the power of all his entry to detain her longer 
with such new to communicate 
and inch 3 visit to 18 rsonmmcen sneer 
prepare for her departure was not to be delayed by anything in his nature to urge 
and she hurried away leaving him to the undivided consciousness of his own ha y address and her explicit encouragement 
he agitation which she had herself experienced on first learning her brothers engagement made her e c to raise no considerable emotion in mr and mrs allen by the communication the wonderful event 
how great was her disappointment 
the aim taint affair which many words of preparation ushered us had been foreseen by them both ever since her brother's arrival 
and all that the felt on the occasional comprehended in a wish or the young people happiness with a remark on the gentleman a side in favour of isabella beauty and on the lady of her great good luck 
it was to catherine the most surprising insensibility 
the disclosure however of the great secret of names going to fuller the day before did raise name emotion in mrs allen 
she could not listen to that with perfect calmness but re easterly regretted the necessity of its concealmengwishe she could have known his intention wished she could have seen him before he went as she should certainly have troubled him with her best regards to his father and mother and her kind compliments to all the sinner 
than 117 
catherine expectations of pleasure from her visit in wilson street were so very high that disappointment was inevitable 
and accordingly though she was most politely received by general tile and kindly welcomed by his daughter 
though henry meat home and no one else of the party she found on her mum without spending many hours in the norther abbey 
l 19 examination of her feelings that she had gone to her step ointment preparing for happiness which it had not dead 
instead of sending herself improved in acquaintance with miss kidney from the intercourse of the day she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before 
instead of seeing entry kidney to greater advantage than ever in the ease of a family party he had never said so little nor been so little agreeable 
and in spite of their fathers great civilities to her in spite of his thanks invitations and compliments it had been a release to get way from him 
it puzzled her to account for all this 
it could not be general tiles fault 
that he was perfectly agreeable and good-natured and altogether a very charming man did not admit of a doubt 
for he was tall and handsome and henry father 
he could not be accounmble for his children want of s rifts or for her want of enjoyment in his company 
he former she hoped at last might have been accident and the latter she could only attribute to her own stupidity 
isabella on hearing the scholars of the visit gave a different explanation 
a it was all pride pride 
insufferable naughtiness and pride 
she had long suspected the family to be very high and this made is certain 
such insolence of behaviour as miss tiles she had never heard of in her life 
not to do the honours of her house with common good breeding 
to behave to her guest with such superciliousness hardly even to speak to her 
a but it was not so bad as that isabella 
there was no in riotousness 
she was very civil 2 h don't defend her 
and then the brother he who had appeared so attached to you 
good heavens well some people feelings are incomprehensible 
and so he hardly looked once at you the whole day 2

but do not insist upon my being very agreeable for my heart you know will be some forty miles off 
and us for dancing do not mention it i beg 
bob 
ll quite out of the question 
charles hodges will plague me to death i dare say 
but i shall cut him very short ten to one but he guesses the reason and that in exactly what i want to avoid 
so i shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself 
isabella opinion of the finest did not indolence her friend 
she was sure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or sister 
and the did not norther abbey 
i 2 10 credit there being any pride in their hearts 
the evening rewarded her confidence 
she was met by one with the same kindness and the other with the some attention as heretofore 
is kidney took pains to be near her and henry asked her to dance 
having heard the day before in wilson street that their elder brother captain toiler 
was expected almost every hour she was at no loss for the name of a very fashionable-looking handsome young man whom she had never seen before and who now evidently belonged w their party 
she looked at him with great admiration 
and even supposed it possible that some people might think him handsomer than his brother though in her eyes his air was more assuming and his countenance less prepossessing 
his taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly inferior 
for within her hearing he not only protested against every thought of dancing himself but even laughed openly at henry for handing it possible 
from the latter circumstance it may be presumed that whatever might be our heroine opinion of him his admiration of her was not of a very dangerous kind 
not likely to produce animosity between the brothers nor persecutions to the lady 
he can not be the instigate of the three villains in horsemen great coats by whom she will hereafter be forced into a travelling chaise and four which will drive of 
with incredible speed 
catherine meanwhile undisturbed by presentiment of such an evil or of any evil at all except that of having but a short set to dance down enjoyed her usual happiness with henry kidney listening with sparkling eyes to everything he said 
and in sending him irresistible becoming so herself 
at the end of the first dance captain kidney came towards them again and much to catherine dissatisfaction pulled his brother away 
they retired whispering together 
and though her delicate sensibility did i i 2 2 norther abbey 
not take immediate alarm and lay it down as fact that captain kidney must have heard some malevolence representation of her which he now hastened to communicate to his brother in the hope of separating them for ever she could not have her warmer conveyed from her sight without very uneasy sensations 
her suspense was of full eve minutes duration 
and she was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an hour when they both returned 
and an explanation was given by henry requesting to know if the thought her friend miss hope would have any objection to dancing as his brother would be most happy he introduced to her 
catherine without hesitation replied that she was ve sure miss hope did not mean to dance at all 
he cruel by was passed on to the other and he immediately led away 
your brother will not mind it i know a said she d because i heard him say before that he hated dancing 
but it was very good-naturedly in him to think of it 
i s post he saw isabella sitting down a and fancied she might wish for a partner 
but he is quite mistaken for she would not dance upon any account in the world henry smiled and said a how very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people actions 2 why 
what do you mean it e with you it is not how is such a one likely to be influenced 
what is the incitement most likely to act upon such a parson s feelings age situation and probable habits of life considered 
but how should i intended 
what would be my indecent in acting so and so p d i do not understand you d then we are on very unequal terms for i understand you perfectly well north anger abbey 
l 2 3 2 me 10 yes 
i can not speak well enough to be unintelligible a brave 
an excellent satire on modern language 
a ut ray tell me what you mean e s i indeed 
do you really desire it 
but you are not aware of the consequences 
it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment and certainly bring on a disagreement between us a no no 
it shall not do either 
am not afraid 
a well then i only meant that your attﬁbudng my brothers wish of dancing with miss hope to good-natured alone convinced me of your being superior in good-natured yourself to all the rest of the world 
catherine blushed and disclaimed and the gentleman’redictions were verified 
there was a something 
never in his word.which repaid her for the pain of confusion 
and that something occupied her mind so much that she drew back for some time forgetting to k or to listen and almost forgetting where she was 
till roused by the voice of isabella she looked up and saw her with captain kidney preparing to give them hands across 
isabella shrugged her shoulders and smiled 
the only explanation of this extraordinary change which could at that time be given 
but as it was not quite enough for catherine comprehension she spoke her astonishment in very plain terms to her partner 
d i can not think how it could happen 
isabella was so determined not to dance 
e and did isabella never change her mind before 2 b c oh 
but because and your brother 
after what you told him from me how could he think of going to ask her i d a i can not take surprise to m if on that head 
you bid me be surprised on your friend s account and therefore i am 
but as for my brother his conduct in 12s 
norther abbey 
the business i must own has been no more than i be 
loved him perfectly equal to 
the fairness of your friend was an open attraction 
her bareness you know could only be understood by yourself b you are laughing 
but i assure you isabella is very warm in generally a it is as much as should be said of any one 
to be always arm must be to be often obstinate 
when purely to relax is the trial of judgment 
and without reference to my brother i really drunk miss horse has by no means chosen ill in ring on the present hour the friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse ill all the dancing was over 
but then as they walked about the room arm in arm 
isabella thus explained herself i do not wonder at your surprise 
and i am really fatigued to death 
he is such a rattle 
amusing enough if my mind had been disengaged 
but i would have given the world to sit still 
a then why did not you p 2 oh 
my dear it would have looked so particular 
and you know how i abhor doing that 
i refused him as long as i possibly could but he would take no denial 
you have no idea how he pressed me 
i begged him to excuse me and get some other partner 
but no not he 
after aspiring to my hand there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of 
and it was not that he wanted merely to dance he wanted to be with me 
oh such nonsense 
i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me 
for of all things in the world i hated ne speeches and compliments 
— 
and so 
and so then i found there would be no peace if i did not stand up 
besides i thought mrs burghers who introduced him might take it ill if i did not 
and your dear brother i am sure he would have been miserable if i had sat down the whole evening 
i “orthanger abbey l 25 am so glad it is over 
my spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense 
and then being such a smart young fellow i saw every eye was upon us 
a he is very handsome indeed 
handsome 
yes i suppose he may 
i dare nyaﬁeople would admire him in general 
but he is not at in my style of beauty 
i hate a horrid complexion and dark eyes in a man 
however he is very well 
mainly conceited i am sure 
i took him down several times you know in my way when the young ladies next met they had a far more interesting subject to discuss 
james lowlands second letter was then received and the kind intentions of his father fully ax lined 
a living of which mr monday was himself patron and incumbent of about four hundred pounds yearly value was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old enough to take it 
no trifling deduction from the family income no beggarly assigned to one often children 
an estate of at least equal value moreover was assured at his future inheritance 
james expressed himself on the occasion with becoming gratitude 
and the necessity of waiting between two and three years before they could marry being however unwelcome no more than he had expected was born by him without discontent 
catherine whose expectations had been as unfixed as her ideas of her father's income and whose judgment was now entirely led by her brother felt equally well satisfied and heartily congratulated isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled 
a it is very charming indeed said isabella with a grave face 
a mr moran has behaved vastly handsome indeed a laid the gentle mrs thro looking anxiously at her daughter 
i only wish could do as much 
one no norther sunny 
could not expect more from him you know 
if he sands he s do more by-and-bye i dare say he will 
for i am sure he must be an excellent good-hearted nun 
four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed 
but your wishes my dear isabella are so moderate you do not consider how little you ever want my dear 
it is not on my own account i wish for more 
but i can not hear to be the means of injuring my dear moran making him sit down upon an income hardly en ugh to and one in the common necessaries of life 
for myself it is nothing 
i never think of myself i know you never do my dear 
and you will always and your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you 
there never was a young woman so beloved as you are i everybody that knows you 
and i dare say when r morals sees you my dear child 
but do not let us distress our dear catherine by talking of such things 
mr moran has behaved so very handsome you know 
i always heard he was a mostexcellent man 
and you know my dear we are not to suppose but what if you had had a suitable fortune he would have come down with something more 
for i am sure he must be a most liberal-minded man a nobody think better of mr moran than i do i am sure 
but everybody has their failing you know 
and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money 
catherine was hurt by these instructions 
i am very sure a said she thrust my father has promised to do as much as he can aﬂord.” bells recollected herself 
d as to that my sweet catherine there can not be a doubt and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me 
it is not the want of more money norther abbey 
i 2 7 that makes me just at present a little out of spirits 
i hate money 
and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a m i should not have a wish unsatisfied 
ah 
my catherine you have found me on there the sting 
the long long endless two years and a half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living 2 yes yes my darling isabella d said mrs hope 2 we perfectly see into your heart 
you have no disguise 
we reflect understand the present vexation 
and eve y must owe you the better for such a noble honest affection catherine's uncomfortable feelings began to lessen 
she endeavoured to believe that the delay of the marriage was the only source of isabella regret 
and when she saw her at their next interview as cheerful and amiable as ever endeavoured to forget that she had for a minute thought otherwise 
james soon followed his letter and was received with the most gratifying kindness 
chapter 5.30 
he lies had now entered on the sixth week of their stay in bath 
and whether it should be the last was for some time a question to which catherine listened with a beating heart 
to have her acquaintance with the stillness end so soon was an evil which nothing could counterbalance 
her whole happiness seemed at stake while the affair was in use and eve thing secured when it was determined that the lo goings should be taken for another fortnight 
what this additional fortnight was to pro deuce to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing henry kidney made but a small part of catherine r 28th norther sissy 
speculation 
once or twice indeed since james engagement had taught her what old be done she had got so far as to indulge in a secret perhaps a but in general the felicity of being with him for the present bounded her views the present was now comprised in another three weeks and her happiness being remain for that period the rest of her life was at such s distance is to excite but little interest 
in the course of the morning which saw this business arranged she visited miss tile and poured forth her joy ful feelings 
it was doomed to he a day of trial 
o sooner had she expressed her delight in mr alleys lengthened stay than miss kidney told her of her father s having determined upon quizzing bath by the end of another week 
here was a blow 
the past suspense of the morning had been ease and quiet to the present disappointment 
catherine countenance fell 
and in a voice of most sincere concern she echoed miss tiles concluding words a by the end of another week 
a yes 
my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what i think a fair trial 
he has been disappointed of some friends arrival whom he expected to meet here and as he is now pretty well is in s hurry to get home a i am very sorry for it a said catherine dejected 
d if i had known this before a b perhaps a said miss tilted in an embarrassed manner you would be so good 
it would make me ve happy if a he entrance of her father put a stop to the civility which catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding 
after addressing her with his usual politeness he turned to his daughter and said a well cleaner may i congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend 10 2 norther abbey 
l 90 i was just beginning to make the request sir as you came in 
well proceed i all means 
i know how much your been is in it 
y daughter miss lowland a he continued without leaving his daughter time to s all a has been forming a very bold wish 
we leave earth as she has perhaps told you on saturday se’nnig’ht 
a letter from my seaward tells me that my presence is wanted at home 
and being disappointed in m hope of seeing the mampus of london and general journey here some of my very old friends there is nothing to detain me longer in bath 
and could we csrryour selfish point with you should leave it without a single regret 
can you in short be prevailed on to suit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend keener with your company in gloucestershire 
i am almost ashamed to make the request though its presumption would certainly appear greater to buy creak 
turn in bath than yourself 
modesty such as yours 
but not for the world would i pain it by open praise 
if a can be induced to honour us with a visit you willyhmke us happy beyond expression 
is true we can never you nothing like the gaieties of this lovely place 
we can turn t you neither by amusement nor splendour for our m e of living as you see is plain and unforefending at no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make unchanged abbey not wholly disagreeable 
norther abbey 
these were thrilling words and wound up catherine's feelings to the highest points of ecstasy 
her grateful and gratified heart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language of tolerable calmness 
to receive so battering an invitation to have her company so warmly solicited 
everything honourable and soothing every present enjoyment and every future hope was contained in it and he acceptance with only the saving clause of papa and 13th norther abbey 
mamma approbation was eagerly given 
d i will write home direct y a said she d and if they do not object as i dare say they will not 
general lonely was not less sanguine having already waited on her excellent friends in plenty street and obtained their section of his wishes 
b c since they can consent to part with you said he we may expect philosophy from all the world 
miss t lonely was earnest though gentle in her secondary civilities and the affair became in a few minutes as nearly settled as this necessary reference to fuller would allow 
the circumstances of the morning had led catherine's feelings through the varieties of suspense security and disappointment but they were now safely lodged in perfect bliss 
and with s rifts elated to rapture with henry at her heart and orange abbey on her i she hurried home to write her letter 
mr and i moran lying on the discretion of the friends 
a whom they had already encrusted their daughter felt no doubt of the propriety of an acquaintance which had been formed under their eye and sent therefore by return of post their ready consent to her visit in gloucestershire 
this indulgence though not more than catherine had hoped for completed her conviction of being favoured beyond every other human creature in friends and fortune circumstance and chance 
everything seemed taco-operate for her advantage 
by the kindness of her first friends the ellen she had been introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met her 
her feelings her presences had each known the happiness of a return 
wherever the felt attachment she had been able to create it 
the affection of isabella was to be secured to her in a sister 
the times they by whom above all she desired to be favourably thought of outstripped even her wishes in the cat northange'r abbey 
i 3 i battering measures by which their intimacy was to be continued 
she was to be their chosen visitor she was to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose society she mostly prized 
and in addition to all the rent this roof was to be the roof of an abbey 
her passion for ancient edifice was next in degree to her passion for henry tile and castles sod shied mode usually the charm of those reveries which his image did not all 
to see and explore either the ramparts and keep of the one or the clusters of the other had been for many weeks a darling wish though to be more than the visitor of an hour had seemed look nearly impossible for desire 
and yet this was to happen 
with all the chances against her of house hall place park court and cottage norther turned up an abbey sud she was to be its inhabitant its long damp passages its narrow cells and ruined chapel 
were to be within her daily reach and she could not entirely subdue the hope of some traditional legend some awful morsels of an injured and lifted nun 
it was wonderful that her friends should seem so little elated by the possession of such a home 
that the consciousness of it should be so meek born 
the power of early habit only could account or it 
a distinction to which they had been born gave no pride 
their superiority of abode was no more to them than their superiority of person 
man were the inquiries she was eager to make or miss lazily 
but so active were her thoughts that when these inquiries were lowered she was hardly more assured than before of norther abbey having been s richly endowed convent at the time of the reformation of its having fallen into the hands of an ancestor of the stillness on its dissolution of a large portion of the ancient building still making a part of the r 120 v norther abbey 
resent dwelling although the rest was decayed or of its standing low in a valley sheltered from the north ancestry rising woods oak 
chapter 31 
it 
a mind thus full of happiness catherine was hardly aware that two or three days had passed away without her seeing isabella for more than a few minutes together 
she began crest to be sensible of this and to sigh for her conversation as the walked along the pump-room one morning by mrs alleys side without anything to say or to hear 
and scarcely had she felt a five minutes longing of friendship before the object of it appeared and inviting her to a secret conference led the way to a search 
this is my favourite place said she as they sat down on a bench between the doors which commanded a tolerable view of everybody entering at either it is so out of the way catherine observing that isabella eyes were continually bent towards one door or the other as in eager expectation and remembering how often she had been falsely accused of being arch thought the present a one rotundity for being really so and therefore gaily said e s not be uneasy isabella 
james will soon be here 
pshaw 
my dear creature a she replied a do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to convince him to my elbow 
it would be hideous to be always together 
we should be the jest of the place 
and so you are going to norther 
i am amazing glad of it 
it is one of the nest old places in england i understand 
i shall depend upon a most particular description of it 
norther abbey 
31 b you shall certainly have the best in my power to give 
but who are you looking for 
are your sister coming 
a d i am not looking for anybody 
ones eyes must be somewhere and you know what a foolish trick i have of fixing mine when my thoughts are an hundred miles off 
i am amazing aunt 
i believe i am the most absent creature in the world 
tiny says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp 2 but i though isabella you had something in particular to tell me p b c oh yes 
and so i have 
but here is a proof of what i was saying 
my poor head 
i had quite forgot it 
well the thing is this i have just had a letter from john 
you can guess the contents d no indeed i can not 10 2 my sweet love do not be so abominable affected 
what can he write about but yourself 
you know he is over head and ears in love with you d with me dear isabella 
b c na my sweetest catherine this is being quite absurd 
modesty and all that is very well in its way but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming 
i have no idea of being so overturned 
it is wishing for compliments 
his attentions were such as a child must have noticed and it was but half an hour before he left bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement 
he says so in this letter 
says that he as good as made you an deer and that you received his advances in the kindest way and now he wants me to urge his suit and say all manner of pretty things to you 
so it is in vain no effect ignorance 
catherine with all the earnestness of truth expressed her astonishment at such a charge protesting her innocence of every thought of mr there s being in love with her and the consequent impossibility of her having 
149 norteanger abbey 
ever intended to encourage him 
a to any attentions on his side i do declare upon my honour i never was sensible of them for a moment except just his asking me to dance the list day of his coming 
and as to making me an offer or any thing like it there must be some unaccountable mistake 
i could not have mieundemood a thing of that kind you know 
and up i ever wish to be believed i solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever planned between us 
the last half hour before he went away 
it must be all and completely a mistake for i did not see him once that whole morning 
but bat ou certainly did for you spent the whole morning in edgar s buildings 
it was the day your father s consent came and i am pretty sure that you and john were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house 
are you 
well if you say it it was so i dare say 
but for the life of me i can not recollect it 
i do remember now being with you and seeing him an well an the rest 
but that we were ever alone for ever minutes 
however it is not worth arguing about for whatever might pass on his side you must be convinced by my having g no recollection of it 
that never thought nor expected nor wished for anything of the kind from him 
i am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me but indeed it has been quite unconventional on my side 
i never had the smallest idea of it 
pray undeceive him as soon as yours and tell him i beg his pardon 
that is i do not know what i ought to say 
but make him understand what i mean in the grocers way 
i would not speak disrespectfully of a rather of ours isabella i am sure but you know very well that i could think of one man more than another it is not the person isabella was silent 
a my dear friend you must not be angry with me 
i can not sup norther lineal 
150 poses your brother cares so very much about me 
and you know we shall still be sisters yes yes 2 split a blush there are more ways than one of our bang sisters 
but where am i wandering 
well my dear catherine the case seems to be 
that you are determined against poor john is not it so 
d i certainly can not return his aﬂ‘ecﬁ'on and as certainly never meant to encourage it since that is the case i am sure i shall not tease you any further 
john desired me to speak to you on the subject and therefore i have 
but i confess as soon as i read this letter i thought it a very foolish t imprudently business and not likely to provoke the good of either 
for what were you to live upon supposing you came together 
you have both of you something to be sure but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays 
and after all that romances may say there is no doing without money 
i only wonder john could think of it 
he could not have received my last 
you do acquit me then of anything wrong 
you i are convinced that i never meant to deceive your brother never suspected him of liking me till this moment 
a oh 
as to that answered isabella laughingly d i do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been 
all that is best known to yourself 
a little harmless flirtation or so will occur and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by 
but you may be assured that i am the lust n in the world to judge you severely 
all those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirits 
what one mane one day you know one may not mean the next 
circumstances change opinions alter 
but my opinion of your brother never did alter 
it l 16a norther abbey 
was always the same 
you are describing what never happened 2 my dearest catherine continued the other without at all listening to her a i would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about 
i do not think an king would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother because he is my brother and who perhaps after all you know might be just as happy without you 
for people seldom know what they would be at young men espeda‘l’ly they are so glaringly changeable and inconstant 
hat i say is why should a brother happiness be dearer to me than a friend 
you know i carry my notions of friendship pretty high 
but above all things my dear catherine do not be in a hurry 
take my word for it that if you are in too great a hurry you will certainly live to repent it 
tiny says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections 
and i believe he is very right 
ah 
here he comes 
never mind he will not see us i am sure a catherine looking up perceived captain kidney 
and isabella earnestly bring her eye on him as she spoke soon caught his notice 
he approached immediately c and took the seat to which her movements invited him 
his first address made catherine start though spoken low she could distinguish a what 
always to be watched in person or by proxy 
a push nonsense 
2 was isabella answer in the same half whisper 
a why do you put such things into my head 
if i could believe it l 
my spirit you know is pretty independent d i wish your heart were independent 
that would be enough for me my heart indeed 
what can you have to do with hearts 
you men have none of you any heart norther essay 
3 if we have not hearts we have eyes 
and they give us torment nough do they 
i am sorry for it 
i am sorry they and an g so disagreeable in me 
i will look another way 
hope this pleases you a turning her back on him 
d i hope your eyes are not tormented how d never more so forth edge of a blooming cheek is still in view 
at once too much and too little catherine heard all this and quite out of countenance could listen no longer 
amazed that isabella could endure it and jealous for her brother she rose up and saying she should join mrs allen proposed their walking 
but for this isabella showed no inclination 
she was so glaringly tired and it was so odious to parade about the pump-room 
and if she moved from her seat she should miss her sisters she was expecting her sisters every moment so that her dearest catherine must excuse her and must sit quietly down again 
but catherine could be stubborn too 
and mrs allen just then coming up to propose their returning home she joined her and walked out of the pump-room leaving isabella still sitting with captain kidney 
with much uneasiness did she thus leave them 
it seemed to her that captain kidney was falling in love with isabella and isabella unconsciously encouraging him 
unconsciously it must be for isabella attachment to james was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement 
to doubt her truth or good intentions was impossible 
and yet during the whole of their conversation her manner had been odd 
she wished isabella had talked more like her usual self and not so much about money 
and had not looked so well pleased at the light of captain kidney 
how strange that sh should not perceive his admiration 
catherine longed to give her a hint of it to put her on her guard and prevent ill the pain which her too lively behaviour k r 18 nonmnuozn abbey 
might otherwise create both for him and her brother 
the corn linen of john thoreau affection did not make amen for thin thoughtless in his sister 
she was almost as far from believing as from wishing it to be sincere 
for the had not forgotten that he could minute 
and his assertion of the offer and of her encouragement convinced her that his mistaken could mmetirnee be very gracious 
in vanity therefore the gained but little her chief proof was in wonder 
that he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in love with her war a matter of lively astonishment 
isabella talked of hit attendant 
6d had never been sensible of any 
but isabella had said many things which the hoped had been spoken in hate and would never be laid again 
and upon this the was glad to rest altogether for present ease and comfort 
custom of a 
few days planned away and catherine though not allowing herself to inspect her friend could not help watching her closely 
the result of her obeervan'one was not agreeable 
isabella seemed an altered creature 
when the raw her indeed surrounded only by their immediate friend 
in edward buildings or paltered street her change of manners was to trifling that had it gone no farther it might have passed unnoticed 
a something of languid indifference or of that boasted absence of mind which catherine had never heard of before would occasionally come across her 
but had nothing worse appeared box might only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest 
but when catherine saw her in nonmanonn abbey 
30 public admitting captain tiles attentions as readily as they were offered and allowing him almost an equal share with james in her notice and smiles the alteration became too positive to be past over 
what could be meant by such unsteady conducrtwhat her friend could be at was beyond her 
comprehending 
isabella could not be aware of the pain she was indicting 
but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which catherine could not but resent 
james was the sufferer 
she saw him grave and uneasy 
and however careless of his present comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart to iver it was always an object 
for poor captain kidney too she was greatly concerned 
though his looks did not please her his name was a passion to her goodwill and she thought with sincere companion of his approaching disappointment 
for in ten of what she had believed herself to overhear in thengumproom his behaviour was so incompao'bh with a knowledge of isabella engagement that she could not upon reflection imagine him aware of it 
he might be jealous of her brother as a rival but if more had seemed applied the fault must have been in her apprehension 
she wished by a gentle remonstrance to remind isabella of her situation and make her aware of this double unkindness 
but for recommence either o impunity or comprehension was always against her 
able to suggest a hint isabella could never understand it 
in this distress the intended do rapture of the tiny family became her chief console action 
their journey into gloucestenhire was to take place within a few days and captain tiles removal would at lean restore peace to every heart but his own 
but captain tile had at present no intention of removing 
he was not to be of the motto nonhanger he was to continue at bath 
hen catherine knew this her resolution was directly made 
she spoke to henry 140 norther abbey 
till on the subject regretting his brothers evident 2 try for miss hope and entreating him to make own her prior engagement 
a my brother does know it a was henry answer 
does he i then why does he stay here i 
he made no reply and was beginning to talk of something else 
but she eagerly continued a why do i not you persuade him to go away 
the longer he stays the worse it will be for him at last 
pray advise him for his own take and for everybody sake leave bath directly 
absence will in time make him comfortable again 
but he can have no hope here and it is only at no to be miserable henry smiled and said a am sure my brother would not wish to do that 
a then you will persuade him to go away 
a persuasion in not at command 
but pardon me if i can not even endeavour to persuade him 
i have myself told him that miss there is engaged

not that james has ever told me so but i am sure he is very uncomfortable c and are you sure it is my brother doing 2 b c yes very sure

no man in offended by another man admiration of the woman he loves 
it in the woman only who can make it n torment catherine blushed for her friend and said a isabella in wrong 
but i am sure she can not mean to torment norther abbey 
421 for she is very much attached to my brother 
she has been in love with him ever since they burst met and while m father's consent was uncertain she fretted herself most into a fever 
you know she must be attached to him 
d i understand 
she is in love with james and flirts with frederick b c oh no not flirts 
a woman in love with one man can not flirt with another 
b c it is probable that she will neither love no well nor dirt so well as she might do either single the gentlemen must each give up a little 
after a short pause catherine resumed with 
then you do not believe isabella so very much attached to my brother d i can have no opinion on that subject but what can your brother mean 
if he knows her engagement what can he mean by his behaviour s 
b you are a very close questioner 2 am i 
only sky i wanted be told 
but do you only ask what i can be expected to tell a b yes i think so 
for you must know your brothers heart 
b c my brothers heart as you term it on the present occasion i assure you i can only guess at 
well 
a well 
nay if it is to be guess-work let us all guest for ourselves 
to be guided by second-hand conjecture is pitiful 
the premises are before you 
my brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man 
he has had about a week s acquaintance with your friend and he has known her engagement almost a long as he has known her well a said catherine seer some moments consideration “_yssmaybesblemguess at your brothers 421 norther abbey

does not he want captain kidney to go away

are you not carried a little too far 
would he thank you either on his own account or mine thorn for supposing that her affection or at least her good behaviour is only to be secured by her agreeing nothing of captain kidney

or in her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by any one else 
he can not think this and on my be sure that he would not have you think it

their hearts are open to each other at neither heart can be to on they know exactly what in required and what can home 
and you may be certain that one will never tune the other beyond what in known to be extant perceiving her still to look doubtful an grave he added though frederick doe not leave bath with us he will probably remain but a very short time perhaps i only a few days behind us 
his leave of absence soon ax und he must return to his regiment 
and what then be their acquaintance the mushroom will drink nelly there for a fortnight and he will laugh with your brother over poor tilney'e passion for a month catherine would contend no longer against comfort she had resisted ill approached during the whole length norther a baby 
i 421 of a speech but it now carried her captive 
henry kidney must know best 
she blamed herself for the extent of her fears and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject again 
her resolution was upon by isabella behaviour in their parﬁnéinterview 
the horses spent the last evening of tben'ne’s stay in plenty street and nothing passed between the lovers to excite her uneasiness or make her it them in up retention 
james was in excellent spirits and isabella most engaging placid 
her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart but that at such a moment was allowance 
and once she gave her lover a cat contradiction and once she drew back her hand but catherine remembered henry instructions and placed it all to judicious affection 
the embraces tears and promises of the parting fair ones maybe fancied 
charm s 
r and mrs allen were sorry to lose their young friend whose good humour and cheer news had made her a valuable companion and in the promotion of whose enjoyment their own had been gently increased 
her happiness in going with miss kidney however prevented their wishing it otherwise 
and as they were to remain only one more week in bath themselves her quizzing them now would not long be felt 
mr allen attended her to wilson street where she was to breakfast and saw her seated with the kindest welcome among her new friends 
but so great was her agitation in sending herself as one of the family and so fearful was she of not doing exactly what was right and of not being able to preserve their good x 4d norther abbey 
opinion that in the embarrassment of the first live minutes she could almost have wished to return with him to paltered street 
miss tiles manners and henry smile soon did away some of her unpleasant feelings but still she was far from being at ease 
nor could the incessant attentions of the general himself entirely reassure her 
nay perverse as it seemed she doubted whether she might not have felt less had she been less attended to 
his anxiety for her comfort his continual limitations that she would est and his often-expressed fears of her seeing nothing to her taste though never in her life before had she beheld half such variety on a breakfast-table made it impossible for her to forget for a moment that she was a visitor 
she felt utterly unworthy of such respect and knew not how to reply to it 
her tranquillity was not in roved by the general impatience for the appearance of his eldest son nor by the displeasure he expressed at his laziness when captain kidney at last came down 
she was quite pained by the severity of his father's reproof which seemed disproportionately to the offence 
and much was her concern increased when she found herself the principal cause of the lecture 
and that his tardiness was chiefly resented from being disrespectfully to her 
this was placing her in a very uncomfortable situation and she felt great come son for ca train kidney without being able to hope or his good wi 10 
he listened to his father in silence and attempted not any defence which concerned her in fearing that the inquietude of his mind on isabella account might by keeping him long sleepless have been the real cause of his rising late 
it was the first time of her being decided in his company and she had hoped to be now able to arm her opinion of him but she scarcely heard his voice while his father remained in the room 
and xmr'rmrtosk abbey 
4d even afterwards so much were his spirits affected she could distinguish nothing but these words in a whisper to e lesser 2 how glad i shall be when you are all or 
2 the bustle of going was not pleasant 
the clock struck ten while the trunks were carrying down and the general had fixed to be out of milton street by that hour 
his great coat instead of being brought for him to put on directly was spread out in the terrible in which he was to accompany his son 
the middle seat of the chaise was not drawn out though there were three people to go in it and his daughters maid had so crowded it with parcels that miss farmland would not have room to sit 
and so much was he intended by this apprehension when he handed her in that she had some difficulty in saving her own new writing-desk from being thrown out into the street 
at last however the door was closed upon the three females and they set of at the sober pace in which the handsome highly-fed four horses of a gentleman usually perform a journey of thirty miles such was the‘distance of norther from bath to be now divided into two equal stages 
catherine spirits revived as they drove from the door 
for with miss kidney she felt no restraint 
and with the interest of a road entirely new to her of an abbey before and a circle behind she caught the last view of bath without any regret and met with every milestone before she expected it 
the seriousness of a two hours bait at petty france in which there was nothing to be done but to eat without being hungry and loiter about without anything to see next followed 
and her admiration of the style in which they travelled of the fashionable chaise and four postilion handsomely diverted rising so regularly in their stirrups and numerous outsiders properly mounted sunk s little under this consequent inconvenience 
149 northan‘ger sissy 
their 3 been perfectly agreeable the delay would have nothing 
but general kidney though so charming a man seemed always a check upon his children spirits and scarcely anything was said but by himself 
the observation of which with his discontent at whatever the inn afforded and his angry impatience at the waiters made catherine grow every moment more in awe of him and appeared to lengthen the two hours into four 
at last however the order of release was given 
and much was catherine then surprised by the general proposal of her taking his place in his sons article for the rest of the journey 
the day was one and he was anxious for her seeing as much of the country as possible 
the remembrance of mr alleys opinion respecting young man's open carriages made her blush at the mention of such a plan and her first thought was to decline it but her second was of greater deference for general tiles judgment he could not propose anything improper for her 
and in the course of a few minutes she found herself with hen in the horrible as happy i being as ever existed 
very short trial convinced her that a carriage was the prettiest equipage in the world 
the chaise and four wheel ed off with some grandeur to be sure but it was a heavy and troublesome business and she could not easily forget its having stopped two hours at petty france 
half the time wo d have been enough for the carriage 
and so chimney were the light horses disposed to move that had not the general chosen to have his own carriage lead the way they could have passed it with ease in half a minute 
but the merit of the carriage did not all belong to the horses henry drove so well so quietly without making any disturbance without papa sang to her or swearing at them 
so different from the only gentleman-coaehman whom it was in her power to norther scant 
4 compare him with 
and then his hat sat so well and the innumerable cape of his great coat looked so becoming important 
to be driven by him next to being dancing with him was certainly the greatest ha illness in the world 
in addition to every other de night she had now that of listening to her own praise 
of being thanked at least on his sisters account for her kindness in thus becoming her visitor 
of heating it ranked as real friendship and described as creating real gratitude 
his sister he said was uncomfortably circumstance 
she had no female companion and in the frequent absence of her father was sometimes without any companion at all 
a but how can that be 
a said catherine 
a are not you with her 
a “northanger is not more than half my home 
i have an establishment at my own house in woods which is nearly twenty miles from my father and some of my time is necessarily spent therein a how sorry you must be for that 
a d i am always sorry to lave eleanor.” 2 yes 
but besides your affection for her you must be so fond of the abbey 
after being used to such a home as the abbey an ordinary parsonage-house muster ve disagreeable 
a e smiled and said b you have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey to be sure i have 
it not it a one old place june like what one reads about 
e and are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as that one reads about may produce 
have you s stout heart 
nerves at for sliding panels and tapestry e d a girl yes i do not think i should be easily frightened because there would be so many people in the home 
and besides it has never been uninhabited and r 4d nonrrrarioiéiz assert 
left deserted for years and then the family come back to it unawares without giving any notice as generally happens 7 no certainly 
we shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood live nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows doors or furniture 
but you must be aware that when a young lady is by whatever means introduced into a dwelling of this kind she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family 
while they snugly repair to their own end of the house she is formally conducted by worthy the ancient housekeeper up a different staircase and along many gloomy passages into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty s before 
can you stand such a ceremony as this 
ill not your mind give you when you and yourself in this gloomy chamber too lofty and extensive for you with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size 
its walls hung wrath to my exhibiting figures as large as life and the bed of dark green stuff or pup les velvet presenting even a funeral appearance 
ill not your heart sink within you 
b c oh 
but this will not happen to me i am sure a how fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment 
and what will you discern 
not tables toilette wardrobe or drawers but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken late on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open and over the fireplace the permit of some handsome warrior whose features will so incomprehensible strike you that on will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it 
worthy meanwhile no less struck by your appearance gazes on you in great agitation and drops a few unintelligible hunts 
to raise your spirits moreover she gives you reason to suppose that the part the abbey you a bed blame non'rmuczn 12s 149 inhabit it undoubted haunted and inform you that you will not have a thing e domestic within call 
with tie parting cordial the camel of you listen to the sound of her recede footsteps as long an the elm echo can reach on an when with fainting spirits you attempt to listen your door you discover with increased alarm that it has no lock 
a oh i mr kidney how frightful 
this ll just like a book 
but it can not really ha pen to me 
i m lure your housekeeper in not real y worthy 
well what then in a nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the into night 
after amounting your manner horror of the bed you will retire to rest and get a few hours unquiet slumber 
but on the second or at farthest the third night after our arrival you will probably have a violent storm 
also of thunder so loud as to ten to shake the advice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountain 
and during the frightful guns of wind which accompany it you wi probably think you dance for your lamp in not extinguished one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest 
uncle of course to repress your curiosity in lo favourable a moment for indulging it you will instantly arise and throwing your dressing-gown around you proceed to examine this mystery 
after a very about enrich you will discover a division in the tapestry to fretfully constructed at to defy the minute inspection and on opening it a. door will immediately apples which door being only secured by mastery burn an a pack you will after a few error succeed in opening and with your lamp in your hand will pass through it into a small vaults room a no indeed 
i ill-will be too much frightened to do my such things a what 
not when dirty but given you to wander so forth anger abbey 
stand that there is a secret subterranean communication between your a moment and the chapel of st anatomy scarcely two as of 
could you shrink from so simple an adventure 
no no 
you will proceed into this small vaults room and through this into several others without perceiving anything very remarkable in either 
in one perhaps there may he a dagger in another a few drops of blood and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture 
but there being nothing in all this out of the common way and your lamp being nearly exhausted you will return towards your own apartment 
in re 
passing through the small vaults room however your eyes will be attracted towards a large old-fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold which though narrowly examining the furniture before you had passed unnoticed 
impelled by an in'esisu'ble presentiment you will eagerly advance to it unlock it folding doors and search into every drawer 
but or sometime without discovering age of importance perhaps nothing but a considerbonrd of diamonds 
at st however by touching a secret spring an inner apartment will open a roll of paper appears you seize it 
it contains many objects of manuscript 
you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber hut scarcely have you been able to decipher 2 oh thou whomsoever thou mayest be into whose hands these memoir of the wretched mailed may fall a when your lamp suddenly expire in the socket and leaves you in total darkness 
a oh no no 
do not say so 
well go on but henry was too much amused by the interest he had raised to be able to carry it farther he could no longer command solemnity either of subject or voice and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancy in the pedestal of matilda’s woes 
catherine recollecting herself grew ashamed of her eagerness and began earnestly to assure him that her attention had been fixed without norther abbey 
is i the smallest ape retention of really meeting with what be related 
2 is kidney she was sure would never put her into such a chamber as he had described 
she was not at all amid a as th drew near the end of their journey her impatience rap sight of the abbey for some time suspended by his conversation on subjects very different returned in full force and every bend in the road was expected with solemn sum to afford a glimpse of its mossy walls of grey stone rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks with the last beams of the sun playing in beautiful splendour on its high gothic windows 
but so low did the building stand that she found herself passing through the great gates of the lodge into the very grounds of norther without having discerned even an antique chimney 
she knew not that she had any right to be surprised but there was something in this mode of approach which she certainly had not expected 
to pass between edges of a modern appearance to and herself with such case in the very precincts of the abbey and driven so rapidly along a smooth level road of line gravel without obstacle alarm or solemnity of any kind struck her as odd and inconsistent 
she was not long at leisure however for such considerations 
a sudden sound of rain driving full in her face made it impossible for her to observe anything further and fixed all her thoughts on the welfare of her new straw bonnet and she was actually under the abbey walls was springing with hearts assistance from the carriage was beneath the shelter of the old porch and had even passed on to the hall where her friend and the general were waiting to welcome her without feeling one awful foreboding of future to herself or one moment suspicion of any past scenes of horror being used within the solemn edifice 
the breeze had not seemed to wait the sighs x 2 norther abbey 
of the murdered to her 
it had wafted nothing worse than a thick drizzling rain and having given a good shake to her habit she was ready to be shown into the common drawing-room and capable of considering where she was 
an abbey 
yes it was delightful to be really in an abbey 
but she doubted as she looked round the room whether anything within her observation would have given her the consciousness 
the furniture was in all the profusion and elegance of modern taste 
the fireplace where she had expected the ample width and pémdemue carving of former times was contracted to a oxford with slabs of plain though handsome marble and ornaments over it of the prettiest english china 
the windows to which she looked with peculiar dependence from having heard the general talk of his preserving them in their gothic form with reverential care were yet less what her fancy had portrait ed 
to be sure the pointed arch was preserved the arm of them was gothic they might be even casements but every pane was so large so clear so light 
to an imagination which had hoped for the smallest provisions and the heaviest stone work for painted glass dirt and cobwebs the difference was very distressing 
the general receiving how her eye was employed began to talk of the smallness of the room and simplicity of the furniture where everything being for daily use pretended only to comfort c. battering himself however that there were some apartments in the abbey not unworthy her notice and was proceeding to mention the costly gilding of one in particular when taking out his watch he stopped short to pronounce it with surprise within twenty minutes of live 
this seemed the word of separation and catherine found herself hurried away by miss tilted in such a manner as convinced her that the straightest 221b 
my fortune nancy 
r s 3 punctuality to the family hours would be expected at orphanage 
returning through the large and lofty hall they ascended a broad m of shining oak which after many night and many landing-places brought them upon a long wide gallery 
on one side it had a image of doors and it was lighted on the other by windows which catherine had only time to discover looked into a quadrille before miss kidney led the way into a chamber and scarcely staying to hope the would and it comfortable 
left her with an anxious entreaty that the would make no little alteration an possible in her dream 
china s 
momentary glance wan enough to satisfy catherine that her apartment was very unlike the one which henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the description of 
it war by no means unreasonable large and contained neither tapestry nor velvet the walls were papered the door was carpeted the windows were neither lees perfect nor more dim than than of the drawing-room below 
the furniture though not of the latest fashion was handsome and comfortable and the air of the room altogether far from cheerful 
her heart instantaneously at case on this point the resolved to lose no time in particular examination of anything a she greatly dreaded obliging the general by an delay 
her habit wherefore was thrown off with all possible hate and the wan preparing to upon the linen package which the chaireaeat had conveyed for her immediate accommodation when her eye suddenly fell on a large high cheat standing back in a deep recur on one side of the fireplace 
l i 4 norther abbey n‘ghtofit made her start 
“dforgetﬁng every thing else she stood gazing on it in motionless wonder while these thoughts crossed her 
this is strange indeed i did not expect such a sight as this 
an immense bevy chest 
what can it hold 
why should it be placed here 
pushed back too as if meant be out of sight 
i will look into it 
coat what it nut will looking it and directly too 
by daylight 
i my till evening my candle may go out a she advanced and examined it closely 
it wan of clear curiously inflated with some darker wood and raised about a foot from the ground on carved mudofthe same 
the locks silver though tarnished from age 
at each end were the imperfect remains of handles also of silver hearken perhaps premature by some strange violence 
and on the centre of the lid was a mysterious cipher in the same metal 
catherine bent over it intently him without being able to anything with certain 
she could not in whatever direction she took it be eye the laetletterto be at 
and yctthatit shouldbeanything else in that house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment 
if not originally theirs by what strange events could it have fallen into the tiny family 
her fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater 
and seizing with trembling bands the harp of the lock 
the resolved at all hazard to satisfy herself at last as to its contents 
with difficulty for something seemed to resist her efforts she raised the lid a few inches 
but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her starting quit her hold and the lid closed with alarming violence 
this illumined intruder was mist tilney’l maid sent by her mistress to be of use to miss moran 
and though catherine immediately dismissed her it recalled her to norther abbey 
11th the sense of what she ought to he doing and famed her in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery to proceed in her dressing without further delay 
her progress was not quick for her thou huts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well c counted to interest and alarm 
and though she dared not waste a moment upon a second attempt she could not remain many‘eaces from the chest at length however having piped one arm into her gown her toilet seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity i t safely be indulged 
one moment surely might spared 
and so desperate should be the exertion of her strength that unless secured by supernatural means the lid in one moment should be thrown back 
with this spirit she sprang forward and her confidence did not deck ve her 
her resolute effort threw back the lid and gave to her astonished eyes the view of a white cotton counterpanes properly folded reposing at one end of the chest 
in undisputed possession 
she was gazing on it with the first blush of so size when miss kidney anxious for her friends ready entered the room and to the rising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expecting was then added the shame of being caught in so idle i search 
that is a curious old chest is not it 
a said miss kidney as catherine hastily closed it and turned away to the glass 
a it is impossible to say how many generations it has been here 
how it came to be 31st put in this room i know not but i have not had it moved because i thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnet 
the worst of it is 
that its weight makes it difficult to open 
in that corner however it is at least out of the way 
catherine had no leisure for speech being at once blushing 
tying her gown and forming wise resolutions 16a uon'rxmozk sunny 
with the most violent dispatched 
miss til tell a hinted her fear of being late 
and in half a no down stairs together in an alarm not wholly founded or general kidney was pacing the drawing-room his watch in his hand and having on the very instant of their entering pulled the hell with violence ordered 
dinner to be on table rim 
catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke and at pale and breathless in s most humble mood concerned for his children and erecting old chests 
and the general recovering his politeness as he looked at her spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend who was absolutely out of breath from haste when there was not the least occasion for h in the world 
but catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself till they were happily seated at the dinner-table when the enemies complacently smiles and a good appetite of her own restored her to peace 
the dining-parlour we a noble room suitable in its diment 
doctor a much larger drawing-room than the one in common use and lined up in a style of luxury and expense which was almost lost on the unpracticed eye of catherine who saw little more than its seriousness and the number of their attendants 
of e former she spoke around her admiration 
sud the general with a very gracious countenance acknowledged that it was by no mere an ill-suited room 
and further confessed that though as careless on such subjects as most people he did look upon n tolerably large sitting-room as one of the enemies of life 
he sup however that she must have been used to much better seized apartments at mr allen s 
d no indeed a was catherine honest assurance 
a mr alleys dining-parlour was not more than half as northangir abbey 
l s 7 large 
and she had never seen so large a room as this in her life 
the enemies good-humour increased 
why as he bad such rooms he thought it would be simple not to make use of them 
but upon his honour he believed there might be more comfort in rooms of only half their size 
mr alleys house he was sure must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness 
the evening passed without any further disturbance and 
in the occasional absence of general kidney with much sin ve cheerfulness 
it was only in his presence t catherine felt the smallest fatigue from her journey 
and even then even in moments of languor or mint a sense of general happiness preponderated and she could think of her friends in bath without one wish of being with them 
the night was stormy 
the wind had been rising at intervals the whole afternoon 
and by the time the party broke up it blew and rained violently 
catherine as she crossed the hall listened to the tempest with sensations of awe 
and when she heard it rage round a corner of the ancient building and close with sudden in s distant door felt for the first time that she was y in an abbey 
yes these were characteristic sounds they brought to her recollection a countless variety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes which such buildings had witnessed and such storms ushered in 
and most heartily did she rejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within walls so solemn 
so had nothing to dread from midnight assassin or taken glints 
henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had told her that morning 
in a house so varnished and so guarded she could have nothing to explore or to suffer and might go to her bedroom as securely as fit had been her own chamber at fuller 
thus wisely mortifying her mind is she proceeded upstairs she was enabled especially on peruse nonmmczx abbey 
conceiving that minx kidney slept only two down on her to mother room with a tolerably my heart 
and her spirit were immediately added by the cheerful blaze of a wood are

150 though in a situation conspicuous enough had never caught her notice before 
henry words the tone of the ebony cabinet which was to escape her observation at em immediately rushed across her 
and though there could be nothing really in it there was something whimsical it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence 
she took her candle and looked closely at the cabinet 
it was not absolutely ebony and gold 
but it was japan black and yellow japan of the handsomest kind 
and as she held her candle the yellow had very much the effect of gold 
the key was in the door and she heads strange fancy to look into it 
not however with the smallest expectation of sending anything but it was so very odd after what henry had said

but how strangely mysterious 
the door was still immovable 
she paused a moment in breathless wonder 
the wind roared down the chimney the rain beat in torrents against the windows and everything seemed to speak the fulness of her situation 
to retire to bed however unsatisfied on such a point would be vain since sleep must be impossible with the consciousness of s mine so mysteriously closed in her immediate again therefore she applied herself the key sud after moving it in e possible way for some instant with the determined ca rarity of hopes last eeomlhedoor suddenly to her hand her but leaped with admit at such a victory and having thrown open each folding door the second being secured only bolts of less wonderful common thanthelock ughinthathcreye could discern 16a norther abbey

catherine heart beat quick but her courage did not fail her 
with a cheek brushed by hope and an eye mining with curiosity her fingers grasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth 
it was entirely empty 
with lets alarm and greater eagerness she seized a 
second a third 3 fourth 
each was equally empty 
not one was left unearthed and in not one was anything found 
well read in the art of concealing a treasure the possibility of false living to the drawers did not escape her and she felt round each with anxious acuteness in vein 
the place in the middle alone remained now unexplored 
and though she had a never from the list had the smallest idea of sending anything any part of the cabinet and wan not in the least disappointed at her ill success thin far it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while she was about it it was some dine however before she could inform the door the same difficulty occurring in the management of this inner lock an of the outer 
but at length it did open 
and not win a hitherto was her search 
her quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed back into the further part of the city apparently for concealment and her feelings at that moment were indescribable 
her heart buttered her knees trembled and her cheeks grew pale 
she seized with an unsteady hand the precious manuscript for half a glance addicted to ascertain written characters 
and while the acknowledged with awful sensations this striking urempliﬁcntion of what henry had foretold resolved instantly to peruse every line before she attempted on m

and do not be uneasy on my father's account he always walks out at thin time of day catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood 
why was miss kidney embarrassed 
could there be any unwillingness on the general side to show her over the abbey 
the pro was his own 
and was it not odd that he she always take his walk so early 
neither her father nor mr allen did so 
it was certainly very provoking 
she was all impatience to see the house and had merely any curiosity about the grounds 
if henry had been with them indeed 
but now she should not know what was picturesque when she saw it 
such were her thoughts 
but she kept them to herself and put on her bonnet in patient discontent she was struck however beyond her expectation by the grandeur of the abbey as she saw it for the first time from the lawn 
the whole building enclosed a large court 
and two sides of the quadrille rich in gothic ornaments stood forward for admiration 
the remainder was shut off by knots of old trees or luxuriant incantations and the steep woody hills rising behind to give it shelter were beautiful even in the leafless month of march 
catherine had seen nothing to compare with it 
and her feelings of delight were so strong 
that without waiting for any better authority she boldly but ford in wonder and praise 
the general listened with asserting gratitude and it seemed as if his own station of danger had waited unfixed all that hour

the number of acme contained in this garden was such as catherine could not listen no without dismay being more than double the extent of all mr alleys an well as her father's including churchyard and pritchard

but perhaps it may he damp t was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old scotch mrs 
and catherine struck by its gloomy aspect and eager to enter it could not even by the general approbation be kept from stepping forward 
he perceived her inclination and having again urged the plea of health in vain was too polite to make further opposition 
he excused himself however from attending in 4 the rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him and he would meet them by another course he turned away 
and catherine was shocked to and how much her spirits were relieved by the separation 
the shock however being less real than the relief ordered it no injury 
and she began to talk with easy gain of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired 
d i am particularly fond of this a said her companion with a sigh 
it was my mother's favourite walk catherine had never heard mrs pitney mentioned in the family before 
and the interest excited by this tender remembrance showed itself directly in her altered a norther abbey

a portrait very like of a departed wife not used by her husband 
he must have been dreadfully comely to her 
catherine attempt bed no longer to hide horn herself the nature of the wings which in spite of all his attentions he had previously excited 
and what had been terror and dislike before was now absolute aversion 
yes aversion 
his gruel to such a charming woman made him odious to her 
he had often read of such characters 
characters which mr allen had been used to call unnatural and overdone 
but here was proof positive of the contrary 
she had settled this point when the end of the path brought them directly upon the general 
and in spite of all her virtuous indignation she found herself again obliged to walk with him listen to him and even to smile when he smiled 
being no longer able however to receive pleasure from the surrounding objects the soon began to walk with lassitude the general perceived it and with a concern for her health which seemed so reproach her for her opinion of him was most urgent for returning with his daughter the house 
he would follow them in a quarter of an hour 
again they parted 
but clear was called backing half minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend horn anger abbey 
in

this second instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck catherine as very remarkable 
em till 
n hour passed away before the general came in 
t on the part of his young guest in no very double consideration of his character 
a this lengthened absence these solitary rambles did not sped a mind at ease or a conscience void of reproach at length he appeared 
and whatever might have been the m of his meditations he could still smile with 150 
tiny understanding in part her friends curiosity soothe house soon renewed the subject 
and her father being contrary to catherine expectations unprovided with any pretence for further delay beyond that of stopping ever minutes to order refreshments to be intheroombytheirretum was last ready escort them 
they set forward 
and with a grandeur of air a dignified step which caught the eye but could not shake the doubts of the well-read catherine he led the way across the hall through the common drawing-room and one useless ante-chamber into a room magnificent both in size and furniture the real drawing-room used only with company of consequence 
it was very noble very grand very charming was all that catherine had to say for her indiscriminsn'ng eye scarcely discerned the colour of the main 
and 31 minuteness of guise all praise that had much meaning was upheld by the general the continent or elegance of any room’n_ﬁtting up could be nothiugtqher

when the generalhadntisﬁedhilown curiosity close examination of every well-known ornament they proceeded to the library an apartment in it way equal magnificence exhibiting a collection of books on which an humble man might have looked with catherine heard admired and wondered with more genuine feeling than before gathered all that she could from this warehouse of knowledge by running over the titles of half shelf always ready to proceed 
but suite of apartments did not spring up with her wishes 
large as was the building she had already visited the part 
though on being told that with the addition of thekitehen thesixorseven room she had now seat surrounded three sides of the court she could scarcely believe it or overcome the suspicion of there being many chambers secreted 
it was some relief however that they were to return to the rooms in common use by passing through a few of less importance looking him the court which with occasional passages not wholly intricate connected the different sides 
and she was farther soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading what had once been a cloister having traces of cells pointed out and observing several doors that were neither opened nor explained to her 
by sending herself successive in a billiard-room and in the general private apartment without comprehending their connection or being able to turn aright when she left them 
and lastly by passing through a dark little room owning henry authority and screwed with his litter of books guns and great-coat 
from the dining-room of which though already seen and always to be seen at eve o'clock the general could not forego the pleasure of pain out the length for the more certain information of allies moran as that she neither doubted nor cared for they pronorthanger abbey

every modern invention to facilitate the labour of the cooks had been within thin their spacious theatre 
and when the genius of other had failed his own had often produced the perfection wanted 
he endowments of this spot alone might at any time have placed him high among the benefactor of the convent 
with the walls of the kitchen ended all the antiquity of the abbey 
the fourth side of thequadrangle having on account of its decaying state been removed by the general father and the present erected in its place 
all that was venerable ceased here 
the new building was not only new but declared itself to be no 
intended only for faces and enclosed behind by stable-yard no infirmity of architecture had been thought geometry 
catherine could have raved at the hand which had swept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest for the purpose of mere domestic economy 
and would willingly have been spared the mortification of a walk through violence no fallen had the general allowed it but if he had a vanity it was in the arrangement of his office 
and as he was convinced that 
to a mind like mice morland’e a view of the accommodations and comforts by which the labour of her inferior were softened must always be baptizing he should make no apology for leading her on 
hey took a slight survey of all 
and catherine was impressed beyond her expectation by their multiplicity and their convenience

they co get through it all had often amazed mrs allen 
and when catherine saw what was necessary here she began to be amazed herself 
they returned to the hall that the chief ctain‘aae might be ascended and the beauty of its wood and moment of rich carving might be pointed out having gained the top they turned in an opposite direction em the gallery in which her room lay and shortly entered one on the lame plan but superior in length and breadth 
she was here shown excessively into three large bedchambers with their dressing-room most completely and handsomely fitted up everything that money and taste could do to give comfort and elegance to apartments had been bestowed on these 
and being furnished within the last over years they were perfect in all that would be generally pleasing and wanting in all that could give pleasure to catherine 
as they were surveying the last the general after slightly naming a few of the distinguished characters by whom they had at times been honoured turned with a smiling countenance to catherine and ventured to hope that henceforward some of the earliest tenants might be a our friend from fullerton.” she felt the trout tied compliment and deeply regretted the impossibility 
of thinking well of a man so kindly dis towards herself and so hall of civility to all her family 
the gallery was terminated by folding doors which north les abbey 
l 77 misltilney advancing thrown passed through andseemedonthepointofd i 
whereby the first door to the left in another long-ash gallery when the general coming forwards called her family and as catherine thought rather angrily back demanding whither she were going 
and what was there more to he seen 
had not miss morning already seen all that could be worth her notice 
and did she not up her friend might be glad of some refreshment r so much exercise 
miss kidney drew back directly and the heavy doors were closed upon the noticed catherine who having seen in a momentary glance beyond them a narrower passage more numerous openings and symptoms of a winding staircase believed herself at last within the reach of something worth her notice 
and felt as she unwillingly paced rack the gallery that she would rather he allowed to examine that end of the house than see all the energy of all the rest 
the general s evident desire of revenging such an examination was an additional stimulant 
something was certainly to be concealed her fancy though it had trespasser lately once or twice could not missed her here 
and what that something was a short sentence of miss tiles as they followed the general at some distance down stairs seemed to point out 
d i was going to mire you into what was my mother s room the room in which she died

but few as they were they conveyed pages of intelligence to catherine 
it was no wonder that the general should shrink from the sight of such object a that room must contain

in the high-backed pause paved with stone which already the had trodden with peculiar awe the well remembered the door of which the general had given no account

in support of the plausibility of this conjecture it further occurred to her that the forbidden gallery in which lay the apartments of the unfortunate man kidney must he an certainly at her memory could guide her exactly over thin w rangeofcelle

and the pedestal of the highly-strained pitch in which every virtue was ascribed to whereby the inconsolable husband who must have been in come w or other her destroyer affected her even to tears 
hat the general having erected such a monument should be able to face it was not perhaps very range and yet that he could lit to boldly collected within it view maintain 60 elevated an air look no farms around nay that he could even enter the church learned wonderful to catherine 
not however that many inmate of being equally hardened in guilt might not be produced 
she could remember dozens norther abbey 
who persevered ineverypossiblevice going from crime to crime murdering whomsoever they chose without any feeling of humanity or remorse till a violent death or s religions retirement closed their black career 
the erection of the monument himself could not in the smallest de affect her doubts of mrs tiles actual decease 
ere she even to descend into the family vault where her ashes were supposed to slumber were she to behold the rolling in which they were said to be released what could it avail in such a case 
catherine had read too much not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a warren figure might be introduced and a superstitious funeral carried on 
the succeeding mincing promised something better 
the general early walk ill-trimmed as it was in every other view was favourable here 
and when she knew him to be out of the house she directly proposed to miss kidney the accomplishment of her promise 
eleanorwas ready to oblige her 
and catherine reminding her as they went of another promise their first visit in consequence was to the trail in her bed-chamber 
it represented a very lave y woman with a mild and pensive countenance testifying so far the expectations of its new observer 
but they were not in every respect answered for catherine had depended upon meeting with features air complexion that should he the very counterpart the very image if not of henry of eleanor’s 
the only merits of which she had been in the habit of thinking nag always an equal resemblance of mother and child 
a face once taken was taken for generations 
but here she was obliged to look and consider and study for a likeness 
she contemplated it however in ten of this drawback with much emotion 
and out r s yet stronger interest would have left it unwillingly 
her agitation as they entered the grat gallery was norther abbey 
1801 too great liar any endeavour at succumb 
she could only look at her companion

admit compouureepoke her entered to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing 
again the passed through the folding-doors again her hand was titan the important lock and catherine hardly able to breathe wan turning to close the former with fear caution when the figure the dreaded figure of the general himself at the further end of the gallery stood before her 
the name of “elmoor” at the me moment in bill loudest tone resounded through the building giving to his daughter the era intimation of his presence and to catherine tear upon tremor 
an attempt at concealment had been her we instinctive movement on perceiving him yet the could namely hope to have escaped his eye 
and when her friend who with an apologize look darted hastily by her had joined and disappeared with him she ran for to her own room my rocking herself in believed that she should never have courage to go down again 
she remained there at least an hour in the agitation deeply cornmiaerating the rule of her poor friend and expecting a summon herself from the angry general to attend him in hit own apartment 
no immured however arrived 
and at in on seeing a carriage drive up to the abbey ache wan embroidered to descend and meet him under the protection of visiting the hreakfart-mom was gay with company

the general or that from some consideration of glory she should be allowed to suppose herself so 
pon this trust she dared still to remain in his presence after the company left them and nothing occurred to disturb it 
in the course of this mornings reflections she came so a resolution of making her next attempt on the forbidden door alone 
it would be much better in every respect that clear should know nothing of the matter 
to involve her in the danger of a second deduction to court her into an apartment which must wring her hurt could not be the office of a friend 
the enemies utmost anger could not be to herself what it might be to a daughter and besides she 
thought the examination itself would be more satisfactory if made without any companion 
it would be impossible to explain to clear the suspicious from which the other had in all likelihood been hitherto happily exempt 
nor could she therefore in bar presence search air those proofs of the general came by which however they might yet have escaped discovery she felt confident of somewhere drawing arch in the shape of some fragment journal continued to the last gasp 
of the way to the apartment she was now perfectly mistress and as she wished to get it over before henry return who was ax on the morrow there was no time so be lost 
the day was bright her courage high 
at forno’cloclt the sun was now two hours above the horizon and it would be only her retiring to dress half an hour earlier than usual 
it was done 
and catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the clocks had ceased to strike 
it was no time for thought she hurried on slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors and without stopping to look or breathe rushed forward to the one in question 
the look yielded to her hand and norther abbey 
18 s lurking with no sullen sound that could alarm a human being 
on tiptoe the entered the room was before her but it was some minutes before she could advance another step 
she beheld what vexed her to the spot 
and agitated every feature 
she saw a large well-proportioned apartment an handsome dimity bed arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid care a bright bath stove mahogany wardrobe and neatly-painted chain on which the warm beams of a western sun gaily poured through two saith windows 
catherine had expected to have her feelings worked and worked they were 
punishment and doubt first failed them and a ghostly proceeding ray of common sense added some bitter emotions of shame 
she could not be mistaken as to the room 
but how grossly mistaken in everything else in miss tiles meaning in her own calculations 
this apartment to which the had given a date so ancient 
a son so awful proved to be one end of what the earls father had built 
there were two other doors in the chamber leading pmhablyinto dressing-clooeu but the had no inclination to open either 
would the veil in which mrs tile had last walked or the volume in which the had it read remain to tell what nothing else was allowed to whisper 
no 
whatever might have been the general s crimes he had certainly too much wit to let them she for dejection 
she was sick of exploring and desired but to be safe in her own room with her own heart only pray to its folly and the was on the point of retreating as softly as she had entered when the sound of footsteps she could hardly tell where made her pause and tremble 
to be found there even by a servant would he unpleasant but by the general and he seemed always at hand when least wanted much worse 
she listened the sound had ceased and resolving not to lose a moment the petted through and closed the door 
at that invent a 1869 forefinger abbey

henry address short as it had been had more thoroughly opened her eyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several disappointments had done 
most grievous was she rambled 
most bitterly did the cry 
it was not only with herself that shows sunk but with henry 
er folly which now seemed even criminal 
was all exposed to him 
and he must despise her for ever 
the liberty which her imagination had dared to take with the character of his father could he ever forgive it 
the absurdity of her curiosity and her fears could they ever be forgotten 
she hated herself more than she could express 
he had in thought he had once or twice before this fatal morning shave something like affection for her

catherine had never wanted comfort more and he looked as if he was aware of it 
the evening wore away with no statement of this soothing politeness 
and her spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity 
she did not learn either to forget or defend the past 
but she learned to hope that it would never transpired farther and that it might not cost her henry s entire regard

than that it had been all a voluntary self-created delusion each trifling circumstance receiving importance from an imagination resolved an alarm and everything forced to bend to one pa one by a mind which before she entered the abbey been craving to be frightened 
she remembered with what feelings she had prepared for a knowledge of norther 
she saw that the infatuation had been created the mischief settled long before her quitting bath and it seemed an if the whole might be traced to the influence of that can of reading which the had there indulged

among the english the believed in their ham and liable there was a general though unequal mixture of good and bad 
upon thin conviction the would not be surprised if even in henry and cleaner til come alight perfection might hereafter appear 
umf 1802 norther abbey 
this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in the character of their father who though cleared from the grossly injuries suspicions which the must ever blush to have entertained she did believe upon serious consideration to be not perfectly amiable 
her mind made on these several points and her resolution formed i 
always judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense she had nothing to do but to forgive herself and be hip her than ever 
and the lenient hand of time did much or her by insensible degradation in the course of another day 
henry astonishing generosity and coldness of conduct in never alluring in the slightest way to what had passed was of the greatest assistance to her 
and sooner than she could have supposed it possible in the beginning of her distress her spirits became absolutely comfortable and capable as heretofore of continual improvement by anything he said 
there were still some subjects indeed under which she believed they must always tremble 
the mention of a chest or a cabinet for instance and she did not love the sight of japan in any 
shape but even as could allow that an occasional moment of past folly however painful 
might not be without use 
the anxieties of common life began soon to summer to the alarm of romance 
her desire of hearing from label 
grew every day greater 
she was quite impatient to know how the bath world went on and how the rooms were avenged 
and especially was she anxious to be assured of isabella having matched some one wetting cotton on which she had left her intent 
and of her continuing on the best terms with james 
her only dependence for information of any kind was on isabella 
james had protested against writing to her till his return to oxford 
and my allen haven hernolmpcsofalettertilllhehadgotbackto 
norther abbey 
1801 fuller 
but isabella had promised and promised again 
andwhenshepromisedathing she was scrupulous in performing it 
this made it so particularly strange 
for nine success mornings catherine wondered over the repetition of s disappointment which each morning became more severe 
but on the tenth when she entered the breakfast 
room her first object was s letter held out by henry willing hand 
she thanked him as heartily as if he had written it himself 
a t is only from james however a n she looked at the direction 
she opened it it was from oxford 
and so this purpose 
dens currants 
though god knows with little inclination for writing i think it my duty to sell you that everything is st an end between miss hope and me 
i left her and bath sunday never so see either again 
i shall not enter into particulars they would only pain you more 
you will soon hear enough from another manner on know where lies the blame 
and i hope we l acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned 
thank god 
i am undeceived in time 
but it is a he blow 
after my father's consent had been so kin y hen 
but no more of this 
she has made me miser e for ever 
let me soon hear from you dear catherine 
you are my only friend 
per love i do build upon 
i wish your visit it norther may be over before captain kidney makes his engagement known or you will be uncomfortably circumstance 
poor who is in town i dread the sight of him

tilltheveryllstﬁfl reasoned with her she declared herself as much attached to me as ever and 104 norther abbey 
laughed at my fears

i meant understand even now what she would be at for there could he no need of my being played at 
no make her secure of tiny 
we parted at last by mutual consent 
happy for me had we never met 
i can never expect to know such another woman i dearest catherine beware how you give your hem 
believe me etc catherine had not read three line before her sudden change of countenance and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder declared her to be receiving unpleasant news 
and henry earnestly watching her through the whole letter aw plainly that it ended no better than it began 
he was prevented however from even looking his surprise by his father's entrance they went to breakfast directly 
but catherine could hardly eat anything 
ten filled her and even ran down her cheeks as she eat 
the letter wane momentinher hand then in her lap and then in her pocket 
and she looked as if she knew not whether did 
the general between his coop and his newspaper had luckily no leisure for noticing her 
but to the other two her dimes wan equally visible ai soon as she dared leave the table she hurried away to her own room 
but the housemaid were buy in it and the war obliged to come down again 
she turned into the drawing-room for privacy but henry and cleaner had likewise retreated thither and were at that moment d in consultation about her 
she drew back trying to g their pardon but was with gentle violence forced to return 
and the other withdrew after cleaner had affectionately expressed a with of being of me or comfort 
to her 
after half an hour’free indulgence of grief and origin umf 
10s reﬂecu'on catherine felt equal to encountering her friends 
but whether he should make her dimes known to them was another consideration 
perhaps if reasoned the might just over an idea just dimly hint at it 
but not more 
no exposed a friend such a friend as isabella hadbeento her 
and then their own brother 10 dearly concerned in it 
she believed the mun wave the subject altogether 
henry and cleaner were by themselves in the breakfast room 
and each ii she entered it looked at her anxiously 
catherine took her place at the table and after a short silence cleaver said a no had new from fuller i hope

but henry began to expect the truth and something in which minx three name was included passed his lips

and yet when we talked about it in bath

a what was her father

they live at pitney 2 are they a wealthy family 2 
no not very 
i do not believe isabella hat any fortune at all 
but that will not signify in your family

he told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to provoke the of hit children the brother and after looked at each other 
a but a rapid cleaner after a about papa would it be to provoke him happen to enable him to marry inch 3 girl 
she must be an unprincipled one or the could not have need your brother in 
and how mange an infatuation on frederick ride 
a who before his eyes if dictating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man 
is not it inconceivable henry 2 frederick too who always wore his heart no madly who found no woman good enough to be in a chat in the meet unpmmiﬁng circumstance the manger presumption against him 
when i think of hi pan declaration i give him up 
moreover i have too good an opinion of mill three prudence to suppose that the would part with one gentleman before the other was secured 
it it all over with frederick indeed

simple forming no pretensions and knowing no disguise such a sister-in-law henry i should delight in a said cleaner with a smile 
but perhaps a observed catherine though she has behaved so ill by our family she may behave better by yours 
now she has really got the man she likes she may be constant 2 indeed i am afraid she will replied henry 
d i am afraid she will be very constant unless a bonnet should come in her way 
that is frederick only chance 
i will get the bath paper and look over the arrival b you think it is all for ambition then 
and upon my word there are some things that seem very like it 
i can not forget that when she burst knew what my father would do for them she seemed quite disappointed that 
it was not more 
i never was so deceived in any one character in my life before 
among all the great variety that you have known and studied 
a my own disappointment and loss in her is very get 
but as for poor james i suppose he will hardly ever recover it your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present 
but we must not in our concern for his sufferings made use yours 
you feel i suppose that in losing i la you lose half yourself you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy 
society is becoming irksome 
and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at bath the very idea of them without her is abhorrent 
you would not for instance now go to a ball for the world 
you feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserved 
on whose regard you can place dependence 
or whose counsel in any difficulty you could rely on 
you feel all this 
norther abbey 
1000 into a said catherine after a few moments reflection i don't ought i 
to by the truth though i am hurt and grieved that i can not will love her that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again i do not feel so very very much addicted 3 one would have thought you feel as you always do wi m is most to the credit of human nature 
such feelings ought to he investigated that they may know themselves catherine by some chance or other found her spirit so very much relieved by thin conviction that she could not regret her being led on though i unaccounuhly to mention the circumstance which had produced it 
hum 117 
tom this time the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young people 
and catherine found with tome surprise that her two young friends were perfectly agreed in considering itahella’l want of consequence and fortune as likely to throw great diﬂiculu'es in the way of her marrying theirbrother 
their persuasion that the general would upon this ground alone independent of the objection that might be raised against her character oppose the complexion turned her feeling 
moreover with some alarm towards herself 
she was at insignificant and perhaps ii portions as isabella 
and if the heir of the gained property had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself at what point of interest were the demands of his younger brother to rest 
the very reflections to which this thought led could only he by a dependence on the effect of that part partiality 
which an the was given to understand by his words as well as his actions 200 norther abbey 
she had from the first been 10 fortunate as to excite in the general 
and by a recollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the subject of money which she had more than once heard him utter and which tempted her to think his disposition in such matters misunderstood by his children 
they were so fully convinced however that their brother would not have the courage to 10 play in person or his father's consent and so repeal assured her that be had never in his life been less liker to come to norther than at the present time that she suffered her mind to be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of her own 
but as it was not to be supposed that captain kidney whenever he made his application would give his father any idea of isabella s conduct it occurred to her as highly expedient that henry should lay the whole business before him as it really was rambling the general by that means to form a cool and impartiality opinion and p his objections on a fairer ground than equality of situations 
she proposed it to him accordingly 
but he did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she had expected 
d no d said he 
my father's hands need not be strengthened and frederick confession of folly need not be forestalled 
he must tell his own story 
a but he will tell only half it's a quarter would be enough 
a day or two passed away and brought no tidings of captain kidney 
his brother and sister knew not what to think 
sometimes it appeared to them as if his silence would be the natural result of the suspected engagement and at others that it was wholly into bible with it

and when do you think air i may look forward to this pleasure 
i mun be at women on monday to attend the meetings and shall probably be obliged to my two or three a well well we will take our chance some one other day 
thereienoneedto ax 
you are not to put yourself at all out of your way 
whatever may happen to have in the house be enough 
think i can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor table 
let me see 
monday will be a busy day with you 
we will not come on monday 
and tuesday will be 10 buy one with me 
i expect my survivor from brougham with his report in the morning 
and afterwards i can not in decay fail attending the club 
i really could not face my acquaintance if i mid away now 
for an i am known to be in the country it would be taken exceedingly mine 
and it is 10 rule with me mix moran never to give offence to any of my neighbour 
if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it 
they are a net of very worthy men 
they have half a buck from norther twice a o 250 norther abbey 
year 
and i dine with them whenever i can 
tuesday therefore we my my is out of the question 
but on wednesday i think henry you may expect us 
and we shall be with you early that we may have arm to look about us 
two hours and three-quarters will carry to waldman i suppose 
we shall be in the carriage by ten 
so about a quarter before one on wednesday you may look for us a ball itself could not have been more welcome to catherine than this little excursion so strong was her desire to be a united with wooden 
and her heart was still bonny g with joy when henry about an hour afterwards came booted and great-coat into the morn where she and cleaner were spitting and said i am come young ladies in a very moralizing strain to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage giving ready-handed actual ha 
new for a adrift on the future that may not be honour witness myself at this present hour 
because i am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at women on wednesday which bad weather or twenty other causes may prevent i must go away directly two days before i intended it go awn d said catherine with a very long face a and why 
b c why 
how can you ask the question 
because no name is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits because i must go and prepare a dinner for you to be sure 10th 
not seriously 
a ay and sadly too 
for i had much rather stay a but how can you think of such a thing after what the general said 
when he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble e because marking would do 
norther abbey 
1801 henry only smiled 
i am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister account and mine 
you must know it to be so 
and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary 
besides if he had not said half so much as he did he has always m an excellent dinner at home that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify 
d i i wish i could reason like you for his sake and my own 
good-bye 
as to-morrow is sunday clearer i shall not return he went 
and it being at any time a much simpler ration to catherine to doubt her own judgment than ears she was very soon obliged to give him credit for being right however disagreeable to her his going 
but the inexplicability of the general conduct dwelt much on her thoughts 
that he was very particular in his eating she had by her own unassisted observation already discovered 
but why he should so one thing no positively and mean another all the w e was most unaccountable 
how were people at that rate to be understood 
who but henry could have been aware of what his father was at 
from saturday to wednesday however th were now to be without hen 
this was the sad tale of every reflection 
and sprang tiles letter would certainly come in his absence and wednesday she was verdure would bewail the st present and future were all equally in gloom 
er brother so unhappy and her loss in isabella so 
and eleanor's spirits always affected by henry a absence 
what was there to interest or amuse her 
she was tired of the woods and the robberies always so smooth and so dry 
and the abbey in itself was no more to her now than any other house 
the painful remembrance of the folly it had helped to nourish and perfect was the only emotion which could spring from s consideration 104 norther abbey 
of the building 
what a revolution in her ideas 
she who had so longed to he in in abbey 
now there was nothing so charming to her imagination as the pretending comfort of a well-connected parsonage something like fuller but better 
fuller had its faults hut woolton probably had none 
if wednesday should ever come 
it did come and exactly when it might be reasonably looked for 
it came 
it was one and catherine trod on air 
b ten o'clock the chaise-and-ibur conedthetwo mother and after e drive of almost twenty mdpégthey entered woolton a large and populous village in i situation not unpleasant catherine was ashamed to say how pretty shethoughtigathegeneralseernedwthinkan apology necessary for the names of the country and the size of village 
but in her heartache preferred to anyone she had ever beeoagand looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage and at all the little candlemas shops which they ebbed 
at the further end of the village and where lay disengaged from the rest of it stood the parsonage a new-built substantial stone house with its semi-circular my and green gates 
and as they drove up to the door henry with the friends of his solitude a large newfoundland happy and two or three terriers was ready to receive and make much of them 
catherine mind was too full as the entered the house for her either to observe or to lay a great deal 
and till called on by the general for her opinion of it she had very little idea of the room in which the was waning 
upon looking round it then she perceived in a moment that it was the most comfortable room in the world 
but she was too guarded to say no and the coldness of her praise disappointed him 
we are not calling it a good home sid he 
norther abbey 
25 we are not comparing it with fuller and norther 
we are considering it as a mere parsonage small and convinced we allow but decent perhaps and habitable 
and altogether not inferior to the generality 
or in other words i believe there are few country personage in england half so good 
it may admit of improvement however 
far be it from me to say otherwise 
and anything in reason 
s how thrown out perhaps 
though between ourselves if there is one thing more than another my aversion it is a patched-on bow catherine did not hear enough of this speech us understand or he by it 
and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by henry at the same time that a my full of refreshments introduced byres servant the general was shortly restored to his complacency and catherine to all her usual ease of spirits 
the room in question was of s commotion wellproportioned size and handsomely fitted up as a dining pay our 
and on their quitting it to walk round the grounds she was shown burst into a smaller apartment belonging peculiarly to the master of the house and made unusually tidy on the occasion 
and afterwards into win was to be the drawing-room with the appearance of which though furnished 
catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the general it was s prettily-sha room the windows reaching to the ground and e view from them pleasant though only over green meadows 
and she expressed her admiration at the moment with all the honest with which she felt it 
oh 
why do not you lit up this room mr kidney 
what i pity to haven ﬁttedupl itisthepretdestroornleversswﬁtisthe prettiest room in the world 
i trust said the general with s most satisfied 26 non-ransom abbey 
smiled “thatitwillvuyqreedilybeﬁxminhcd twill only for a lad lasted a well if it wan my house i should never it anywhere else 
oh what a sweet little cottage there in among the trees 
apple tree too 
it in the prettiest mus it you like it you approve it as an object it ll enough 
henry remember that robinson is spoken to about it 
the cottage remain 
such a compliment recalled catherine conaeioueneu and silenced her directly 
and though pointedly applied to by the gem for her choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings nothing like an opinion on the object could be drawn from her 
the influence of fresh object and fresh air however w of great we in dissipation these embalming associations and having reached the ornamental part of the premises consulting of a walk round two sides of a row on which henry genius had begun to act about half a year ago she was mﬂiciendy recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure-ground she had ever been in before though there was not a shroud in it higher than the green bench in the corner 
a winter into other meadows and through part of the village with a visit to the rules to examine some improvements and a charming game of play with a litter of puppies able to roll about 
brought them to four o'clock when catherine scarcely thought it would be three 
at four they were to dine and at six to set or 
on their return 
never had any day patted so quickly 
she could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem to create the smallest anoniihmen in the general 
nay that he was even looking at the ride 
table for cold meat which was not there 
his son and daughter observation were of a different kind 
they had seldom seen him eat no heart at any able norther abbey 
2 oh but his own 
and never before known him so little din concealed by the melted butter being oiled 
at six o'clock the general having taken his coffee the carriage again received them 
and so gratifying had been the terror of his conduct throughout the whole visit to well watered wan her mind on the subject of his expectation that could the have felt equally confident of the wishes of iron catherine would have quitted woolton with little anxiety at to the how or the when the might return to it

a catherine was tormented out of further bitterness frederick d not be un neath guilty while henry made himself so agree em she resolved on not answering intellect letter and tried to think no more of it 
hum 17 
on em this the general found himself obliged to go to london for n week 
and he left nonhanger earnestly regretting that any necessity should rob him even for an hour of mill morlaud’e company and anxious recommending the study of her comfort and amusement to his children a their chief object in his absence 
his departure gave catherine the list experimental conviction that a loss may be sometimes a gun 
the happiness with which their time now planned every employment voluntary every laugh indulged every meal a revenge of ease and good-humour walking where they liked and when they liked their hours pleasures and fatigue at their own come 
and made her thoroughly exile of the rearing which the general presence had improved and most thankfully feel their pretext released from it 
such ease and such delights made her love the place and the 2 i 2 norther abbey 
peoplemoreandmoreeveryday 
and had toe been for a dread of in no becoming expedient to leave the one and an apprehension of not being equally beloved by the other the would at each moment of each hay have been perfectly happy 
but the wax now in the fourth week of her visit 
before the general came home the fourth week would be turned 
and perhaps it might seem an intrusion if she inasmuch longer 
thin was a painful consideration whenever it occurred 
and eager to get rid of ouch a weight on her mind the very soon resolved to speak no clear about it at once proposed going away and be guided in her conduct by the manner which her proposal might be taken 
aware that if the gem herself much time the might heel it difficult to bring forward so unpleasant a subject she took the list rotundity of being suddenly alone with elegance and eleanor’l being in the middle of a speech about something verydiﬁerengto start forth her obligation of going away very soon 
clear looked and declared herself much concerned 
she had a hoped for the pleasure of her company for a much longer time 
had been filled perhaps by her wishes to suppose that a much longer visit had been provided and could not but think that if mr and mrs moran were aware of the pleasure itself to have her there they would be too generous to heaven her returned catherine explained

she did almost always believe that henry loved her and quite aware that hit father and litter loved and even winked hero belong to them

would allow them to judge that a carriage was driving up to the door and the next momentoonﬁmedtheideahytheloudnoiseofthe household 
after the ink perturbation of surprise had passed away in a 
good heaven 
what can he the matter 
it war quickly decided by clear to be her eldest brother where arrival wan often an madder if not quite to unreasonable and accordingly the hurried down to welcome him 
2 104 norther abbey 
catherine walked on to her chamber making up her mind as well as she could to a further acquaintance with captain tile and comfort herself under the unpleasant impression his conduct had her and the persuasion of his being by far too line a gentleman approve of her that at least they should not meet under such circumstances as would make their meeting materially painful 
she trusted he would never speak of miss who and indeed as he must by this time be ashamed o the part he had acted there could he no danger of it 
and as long as all mention of bath scenes were avoided she thought she could behave to him very civilly 
in such considerations time passed away and it was certainly in his favour that clear should he so glad to see him and have so much to say for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival and cleaner did not come up 
at that moment catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery and listened for its continuance but all was silent 
scarcely however had she convicted her fancy of error when the noise of something moving close to her door made her start 
it seemed as if some one was touching the very doorway and in another moment a slight motion of the lock proved that some hand must he on it 
she trembled a little at the idea of anyone approaching so cautiously but resolving not to be again overcome by trivial appearances of alarm or misled by a raised imagination she stepped quietly forward and opened the door 
clear and only cleaner stood there 
catherine spirits however were tranquillized but for an instant for eleanor’s cheeks were pale and her manner greatly agitated 
though evidently intending to come in it seemed an effort to enter the room and a still greater to speak when there 
catherine supposing some uneasiness on captain tiles account could only express her concern by 18 17

it is no one from woolton 
it is my father himself 
her voice faltered andhereyesweremmdtothegroundas she mentioned his name 
his unlocked-for return was enough in itself to make catherine's heart sink and for a few moments hardly supposed there were any thing worse to he told 
she aid nothing 
and cleaner endeavouring to collect herself and speak with firmness but with eyes sup ll cut down soon went on 
b you are too good i am sure to think the worse of me for the part i am obliged to perform 
i am indeed a most unwilling messenger 
after what has so lately passed so lately been settled between us how joyfully how thankfully on my side 
as to your continuing here as i hoped for many many weeks longer how can i tell you that your kindness is not to he accepted and that the happiness your company hitherto given us is to be repaid by butimustnottmstmyselfwithwords

but how can i tell you 
to-morrow morning is fixed for your leaving us and not even the hour is left to your choice 
the very carriage is ordered 
and will be here at seven o'clock and no servant will be offered you catherine sat down breathless and speechless 
i could hardly believe my same when i heard it 
and no displeasure no resentment that you can feel at this moment however justly great can he more than i my 
if 
but i must not talk of what i felt 
oh that i northangbr abbey

then is nothing 
do not think about that 
and 2 we are to part a fey/hours sooner or later you know makes no difference 
i can be ready by seven 
let me be called in time cleaner saw that she wished to be alone 
and believing it better for each that they should avoid any further conversation now left her with a i shall see you in the morning catherine swelling heart needed relief 
in eleanor‘s presence friendship and pride had equally restrained her tears but no sooner was she gone than they burst forth in torrents 
turned from the house and in such a way without any reason that could justify any apology that could atone for the aptness the rudeness nay the insolence of it 
henry at a distance 
not able even to bid him farewell 
every hope every expectation from him suspended at least and who could say how long 
who could say when they might meet again 
and all this by such a man as general kidney so polite so well-read and heretofore so particularly fond of her 
it was as incomprehensible as it was mortifying and grievous 
from what it could arise and where it would end were considerations of equal perplexity and alarm 
the manner in which it was done so grossly uncivil hurrying her away without any reference to her own convenience or allowing her even the appearance of choice as to the time or mode of her travelling 
of two days the earliest fixed on and of that almost the earliest hour as if resolved to have her ne before he was stirring in the morning that he might not be obliged even to see her 
what could all this mean but an intention affront 
by some means or other she must have had the misfortune to lend him 
clear had wished to spare her from so painful a notion but catherine could not believe it possible that norther abbey 
2 i 9 any injury or any misfortune could provoke such ill-will against a person not connected or at least not supposed to be connected with it 
heavily passed the night sleep or repose that deserved the name of sleep was out of the question 
that tom in which her disturbed imagination had tormented her on her first arrival we again the scene of agitated spirits and unquiet slumbers 
yet how different now the source of her inquietude from what it had been then 
how mournfully superior in reality and substance 
her anxiety had foundation in fact her fears in probability 
and with a mind so occupied in the contemplation of actual and natural evil the solitude of her situation the darkness of her chamber the antiquity of the building were felt and considered without the smallest emotion and though the wind was high and often produced strange and sudden noises throughout the house she heard it all as she lay awake hour after hour without curiosity or terror 
soon after six cleaner entered her room eager to show attention or give assistance where it possible 
but very little remained to be done 
catherine had not loitered 
she was almost dressed and her packing almost banished 
the possibility of some conciliating message from the general occurred to her as his daughter appeared 
what so natural as that anger should pass away and repentance succeed it 
and she only wanted to know how far after what had an apology might properly be received by her 
ut the knowledge would have been useless here it was not called for 
neither clemency nor dignity was put to the trial 
clear brought no message 
very little passed between them on meeting each found her greatest in silence 
and few and trivial were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs 
catherine in busy agitation completion her dress and cleaner with more good-will dun experience intent upon filling the 220 nortkanger abbey 
trunk 
when everything was done they left the room catherine lingering only half minute behind her friend to throw a parting glance on every well-known cherished and went down to the breakfast-parlour where breakfast wan prepared 
she tied to eat farewell to cave herself from the pain of being urged as to make her friend comfortable 
but she had no appear and could not swallow many mouths 
the contrast between thieandherlastbreakfastin that room gave her fresh misery and strengthened her distaste for everything before her 
it wan not four-and-twenty hours ago since theyhadmthemmthemempambutin circumstances how different 
with what cheerful use what happy though false security had she then looked around her enjoying everything present and fearing little in future beyond henry going to woman for a day 
happy happy break 
for henry had been there 
henry had sat by her and helped her 
these reflections were long indulged undisturbed by any address from her companion who eat as deep in thought as herself 
another appearance of the carriage was the first thing to start and recall them to the recent moment 
catherine colour rose at the sight it 
and theindignity with which she was treated striking at that instant on her mind with peculiar force made her for a short time sensible only of resentment 
clear seemed now impelled into resolution and speech 
b you my 
write to me catherine d she cried 
b you mun let me hear from you as soon as possible 
till i know you to be safe at home i shall not have an hour comfort formlemrataumauhawngmu-t entreat

there can be no doubt of my getting home safely cleaner only replied i can not wonder at your feelings 
i will not important you 
i will trust to your own kindness of heart when i am at a distance from you 
but this with the look of sorrow accompanying it was enough to melt catherine's pride in a moment and she instantly said a oh 
clearer i will write to you indeed 
a there was yet another point which miss kidney was anxious to settle though somewhat embarrassed in speaking of 
that occurred to her that after so long an absence from home catherine might not be provided with money enough for the expenses of her journey and upon suggesting it to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation it proved to he exactly the case 
catherine had never thought on the subject till that moment 
but upon examining her purse was come evinced that but for this kindness of her friend she might have been turned fury the house without even the means of getting home 
and the distress in which she must have been thereby involved filling the minds of both warped another word was said by either during the time of their remaining together 
short however was that time 
the carriage was soon announced to be ready 
and catherine instantly rising along and affectionate embrace supplied the p ace of language in bidding each other adieu 
and so they entered the hall unable to leave the house without some mention of one whose name had not yet been spoken by either she paused a moment and with quivering lips just made it intelligible that she left her kind remembrance for her absent friendly but with this approach to his name ended all possibility of remaining her feelings 
and hiding her 221b norther abbey 
face as well as she could with her handkerchief she darted across the hall jumped into the chaise and in a moment was driven from the door 
chasm it 
catherine was too wretched to be fearful 
the journey itself had no terrors for her 
and she began it without either dreading its length or feeling its solitariness 
leaning back in one corner of the carriage in a violent burst tears she was conveyed some miles beyond the walls of the abbey before she raised her head 
and the highest point of ground within the park was almost closed from her view before she was capable of turning her eyes towards it 
unfommately the road she now travelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily passed along in going to and from woolton 
and for fourteen miles every bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects on which she had first looked under impressions so different 
every mile as it brought her nearer woolton added to her sufferings 
and when within the distance of live she passed the turning which led to it and thought of cry so near yet so unconscious her grief and agitation were excessive 
the day which she had not at that place had been one of the heap jest of her life 
t weathered it was on that day that the general had made use of such expressions with regard to henry and herself had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage 
yes only ten days ago had he wished her by his pointed regard 
had he even confused her by his too significant reference 
and now what had the done or what had she omitted to do to merit such a change 
nothing abbey 
2 2 3 the only offence against him of which she could accuse herself had been such as was scarcely possible to reach his knowledge 
henry and her own heart only were prize to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly entertained 
and y safe did she believe her secret with each 
deer y at least henry could not have betrayed her 
f indeed by any arrange mischance his father should have gained intelligence of what she had dared to think and look for of her candle fancies and curious examination she could not wonder-stony degrees he indignation 
if aware of her having viewed him as a murderer she could not wonder at his even turning her from his house 
but a justification so full of torture to herself she muted would not be in his power 
anxious as were all her conjectures on this into it was not however the one on which she went most 
there was a thought yet nearer 
a more prevailing more impetuous concern 
how henry would think and feel and look when he returned on the marrow or norther unheard-of herding glove was a question of force and interest to ride on every other to he never-ending alternately imitating and loathing it sometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence and at other was answered by the sweetest confidence in his reprimand resentment 
to the general of course he would not dare to 
but to clear what might he not say no clear shoot her 
in this unceasing recurrence of double send inquiries on any one article of which her mind was incapable of more than momentary repose the hours passed away and her journey advanced much faster than she looked for 
the pressing anxieties of thought which present her from noticing anything before her when once beyond the neighbourhood of wooden saved her at the same time from watching her progress 
and though no object 12s norther abbey 
on the road could engage a moment attention she found no stage of it tedious 
from this she was preserved too by another cause 
by feeling no eagerness for her journey conclusion 
for to remain in such a manner to fuller was almost to destroy the pleasure of a meeting with those she loved best even r an absence such as hers an eley weeks absence 
what had she to say that would not humble herself and pain her family 
that would not increase her own grief by the confession of it 
extend an useless resentment and perhaps involve the innocent with the guilty in undisn'nguishing ill-will 
she could never do justice to henry and eleanor’s merit she felt it too strongly for expression and should a dislike be taken against them should they be thought of unfavourable on their father's account it would cut her to the heart 
with these feelings she rather dreaded than sought for the first view of that well-known spire which would announce her within twenty miles of home 
salisbury she had known to be her point on leaving norther but after the first stage she had been indebted to the postmaster for the names of the places which were then to conduct her to it 
so great had been her ignorance of her route 
she met with nothing however to distress or frighten her 
her youth civil manners and liberal pay secured her all the attention that a traveller like herself could require 
and stopping only to change horses she travelled on for about eleven hours without accident or alarm and between six and seven o'clock in the evening found herself entering fuller 
a heroine returning at the close of her career to her native village in all the triumph of recovered reputation and all the dignity of a countess with a long train of noble relations in their several phantoms and three waiting-maid in a travelling chaise-and~four behind northangir abbey 
3 her is an event on which the pen of the contrive may well delight to dwell 
it gives credit to every conclusion and the author must share in the glory she so liberally bestow 
but my affairs is widely different i bringbsckrnyheroine to her home in solitude and disgrace and no sweet claim of spirits can lad me into minuteness 
a heroine in a back post-chaise is sad a blown sentiment as no attanptat grandeur or pathos can withstand 
swiftly therefore shall her postboy drive through the village amid the gaze of sunday jumps and speedy shall be her descent from it 
but whatever might be the dimness of catherine mind as she thus advanced towards the parsonage and whatever the humiliation of her biographerin relating it she was preparing enjoyment of no every-day nature for those to whom she went 
first in the appearance of her carriage and secondly in herself 
the chaise of a traveller being a rare sight in fuller the whole family were immediately at the window

3 her father mother arab george and hurried all assembled at the door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness was a sight to awaken the best feelings of catherine heart 
and in the embrace of each as she stepped from the carriage she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed possible 
so surrounded so caressed

but now it in all over perhaps there in no harm done 
it is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves 
you know my dear catherine you always were a sad little feather-brained creature but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you with so much changing of chance and so forth 
and i hope it will appears that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets 
catherine hoped so no andtriedto feelanintereat in her own amusement but her spirits were quite worn down 
and to be silent and alone becoming noon her only wish she readily agreed to her mother next counsel of going early to bed 
her parents seeing nothing in her ill-lit and agitation but the natural consequence of mortified feelings and of the unusual exertion and fatigue of such a journey 
parted from her without any doubt of their being noon depot away 
and though when they all met the next morning her recovery war not equal to their hopes they were nil perfectly unsurpicioua of there being any deeper evil 
they never once thought of her heart which for the parent of a young lady of seventeen just returned from her first excursion from home war odd enough 
izz norther sum

for already did catherine reproach herself with having parted from cleaner coldly 
with having never enough turned her merit or kindness 
and never enoughoommiseratedherforwbatshehadheenymr 
day left to endure 
the strength of these feelings however was far from assisting her pen 
and never had it been harder for her to write than in addressing cleaner kidney 
to compose a letter which might at once do justice to her sentiments and her situation convey gratitude without sensible regret be guarded without coldness and home without resentment 
a letterwhich cleaner might not be b the of 
and above all which she might blush were if henry should chance to see was an unfair to frighten away all her powers of performance 
and after long thought and much perplexity to be very brief was all that she could determine on with any confidence of safety 
the money therefore which cleaner had advanced was enclosed with little more than grateful thanks and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate heart

with a m of much respect he immediately rose and being introduced to her by her conscious daughter as a mr henry kidney with the embarrassment of real sensibility began to apologise for his appearance there acknowledge that after what had passed he had little right to expect a welcome at fuller and stating impatience to be assured of miss lowlands having reached her home in safety as the cause of his intrusion

after a couple of minute unbroken silence henry turning to catherine for the list time since her mother once used her with sudden alacrity if mr and my allen were now it fuller 
and on developing from amid all her perplexity of words in reply the meaning which one short syllable would have given immediately expressed his intention of paying his respects to them and with a rising colour asked her if he would have the goodness to threw him the way 
b you may lee the home from this window air a wan information on martha side which roused only a bow of acknowledgment from the glen em and a lending nod from her mother for my moran thinking it probable as a secondary consideration in his with of waiting on their worthy neighbour that he might have james explanation to give of his other behaviour which it must he more pleasant for him to communicate only to catherine would not on any account prevent her accompanying him 
they began their walk and mrs moran wan not entirely sicken in his object in washing it 
some explanation on hiefnther’eaccounthehad forgive 
but hieﬁrutpurpone wan to explain himself 
and before they reached 26 norther abbey 
mr allen s grounds he had done it in well that catherine did not think it could ever be repeated too often 
she was assured of his affection 
and that heart in return was solicited which perhaps they pretty equally knew was already entirely his own 
for though henry was now sincerely attached to her 
— though he felt and delighted in all the excellencies of her character and trulyloved her society 
i must confess that his affection originated in nothing better than gratitude 
or in other words thataperxnasionofherpanialityforhhn hadbeenthe only cause of giving her a serious thought 
it is a new circumstance in romance i acknowledge and dreadfully purgatory of an heroine dignity 
but if it be as new in common life the credit of a wild imagination will at least be all my own 
a very short visit to mrs allen in which henry talked at random without sense or connection and catherine wrapt in the contemplation of her own unutterable happiness scarcely opened her dismissed them to the extremes of another tétc-h-téte 
and before it was suffered to close she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctified by parental authority in his present application 
on his return from woolton two days before he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father hastily informed in angry terms of miss lowlands departure and ordered to think of her no more 
such was the permission n which he had now offered her his hand 
the alighted catherine amidst all the seniors of expectation as she listened to this account could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious dejection by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject 
and as he proceeded to give the particulars and explain the motives of his father s conduct her soon hardened into even a triumphant delight 
the general had had nothing to accuse her of nothing to nonrmxcnn abbey 
27 lay to her charge but her being the involuntary unconscious object of a den don which his pride could not pardon and which a pride would have been ashamed to own 
she was guilty only of being less rich than he had supposed her to be 
under mistaken persuasion of her possessions and he had courted her acquaintance in bath solicited her company at norther and designed her for his daughter-in-law 
on discovering his error to turn her from the house seemed the best though to his feelings an inadequate proof of his resentment towards herself and his contempt of her family 
oh there had first misled him 
the general perceiving his son one night at the theatre to be paying considerable mention to miss moran had accidentally inquired of hope if he knew more of her than her name 
the most ha y to be on speaking terms with a man of general volney s importance had hem joyfully and proudly communicative 
and being at that time not only in daily expectation of morland'a engaging isabella hut likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying catherine himself his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them 
with whomsoever he was or was likely to be connected his own consequence alway required thatcher could he got 
and as he intimacy with any acquaintance grew la y grew their forms 
the expectation of his friend moran therefore from the ink overruled had ever since he introduction to isabella been gradually increasing 
and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment by doubling what he chose to think the amount of mr morland’a preference trembling his private fortune bestowing a rich aunt and linking half the children he was able to represent the whole family to the general in a most respectable light 
2 18 non-human abbey 
for catherine however the peculiar object or the general curiosity and his own speculations he had yet something more in reserve 
and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would he a pretty addition to mr allen s estate 
her intimacy there had made him seriously determine on her being handsomely elegancies hereafter 
and to speak of her therefore as the almost acknowledged texture heiress of fuller naturally followed 
upon such intelligence the general had proceeded for never had it occurred to him to doubt its authority 
there's interest in the family by hi sister's approaching connection with one of in moment and his own views on another of which he boasted with almost equal openness seemed sufficient vouching for his truth 
and to these were added the absolute facts of the lies being wealthy and childless of miss lowlands being under their care and as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge of their thinking her with parental kindness 
his resolution was soon formed 
already had he discerned a liking towards miss normandy in the countenance of hit son 
and thankful for mr harpers communication he almost instantly determined to spare no pains in quickening his boasted interest and mining his dearest hope 
catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all this than his own children 
henry and clamor perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their fathers ocular respect had seen with astonishment the an entries continuance and extent of his attention 
and though latterly from some hunts which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in power to attach her henry was convinced of his father's believing it to be an advantageous connection it was not till the be explanation at norther that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations 
which had hurried norther anna 
30 him on 
that they were false the general had learned from the very person who had suggested them from horse himself whom he had chanced to meet again in town 
and who under the influence of exactly opposite feelings irritated by catherine real and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to account fish a reconciliation between moran and isabella convinced that they were for ever and spinning a friendship which co d be no longer serviceable heed to contradict all that he had laid before to the advantage of the morlocks confused himself have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father nun of absence and credit whereas the action

the terrified general pronounced the name of allen with an inquiring look 
and here too there had learnt his error 
the ellen he believed had lived earthen too long and he knew the young man on whom the fullest mute must devolved 
the general needed more 
enraged with almost everybody in the world but himself he let out the next day for the abbey where his performances have been seen

catherine at any rate heard enough to feel that in capering general kidney of either murdering or shutting up his wife she had scarcely sinned again his character or imagined hit cruelty 
henry in having such things to relate of his father was almost an pitiable as in their first avowals to him he blushed for the narrow-minded counsel which he was obliged to explore 
the conversation between them at nonlnnger had been the mostunfriendly kind 
henry indignation on hearing how catherine had been treated on comprehending his father s views and being ordered to acquiesce in them had been open and hold 
the general accustomed on every ordinary occasion to give the love in his family prepared for no reluctance but of a feeling no desire that should dare to clothe itself in words can d ill brook the opposition of his son ready as the action of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it 
but in such a cause his anger though it mun huck could not instigate henry who was obtained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice 
he felt himself bound as much in honour as in action to miss moran and believing that hurt to be his own which he had been directed to gain no unworthy protraction of a tacit consent no reversing decree of unjustiﬁable anger could shake his fidelity or influence the resolution it prompted 
he steadily refined to accompany his father into herefordshire an engagement formed almost at the moment to provoke the dismal of catherine and as northanglk abbey

but till that one was removed it must be impossible for them to unchain the engagement 
their tempers were mild but their principles were steady

they were no more inclined than entitled to demand his money

the young people could not be surprised at a decision like this 
they

henry returned to what was now his only home to watch over his young incantations and extend his improvements for her sake to whose share in them he looked anxiously forward 
and catherine remained at fuller to cry 
whether the torments of absence were softened by a clandestinely correspondence let us not inquire

they had been too kind to exact any promise and whenever catherine received a letter as at that time happened pretty often they always looked another was
