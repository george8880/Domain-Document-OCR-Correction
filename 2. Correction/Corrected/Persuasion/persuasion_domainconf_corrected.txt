there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a distressed one

there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt

he considered the meeting of beauty at inferior only to the bleating of a baronetcy

she had harboured or softened or concealed his failings and provoked his real rcspccuibility for seventeen years 
and though not the very happiest being in the world herself had found enough in her duties her friends and her children to attach her to life and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them 
three girls the two eldest sixteen and fourteen was an awful legally for a mother to bequeath an awful charge rather to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited silly father 
she had however one very intimate friend a sensible deserving woman who had been brought by mang attachment to herself to settle close by her in the village of lynch 
and on her kindness and advice lady enlist mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instructions which she had been anxiously giving her daughters 
this friend and sir walters did not marry whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance 
thirteen years had passed away since lady elliot’s death and they were still near neighbours and minute friends and one remained a widower the other a widow 
that lady russell of steady age and character and extremely well provided for should have no thought of a second marriage needs no apology to the public which is rather apt to be unreasonable daunted when a woman doe marry again than when she does not but sir walters continuing in singlenesa requires explanation 
be it known then that sir water like a good father having met with one or two private dish persuasion 
a appointment in very unreasonable application himself on remaining single for his dear daughter take 
for one daughter his least he would really have given up anything which he had not been very much tempted to do 
elizabeth had succeeded at sixteen to all that will possible of her mother righthand consequence 
and being very handsome and very like himself her influence had always been great and they had gone on together most happily 
two other children were of very inferior value 
mary had acquired a little artificial importance by becoming man charles mauve 
but annie with an elegance of mind and women of character which must have placed her high with in people of real understanding was nobody with either ther or sister 
her word had no weight her convenience wan always to give way 
the was only annie 
to lady ruse indeed she wan a more dear and highly valued grand-daughter favourite and friend 
lady russell loved them all but it was only in annie that the could fancy the mother to revive again 
a few years before anyone enlist had been a very pretty girl but her bloom had vanished early 
and as even in it height her father had found little to admire in her so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own 
there could be nothing in them now that she was faded and thin to excite his esteem 
he had never indulged much hope he had now none of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite worst 
all equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth for mary had merely connected her with an old country family of respectability and large fortune and had therefore given all the honour and received none elizabeth would one day or other marry suitably

and in one of their ring excursions to london when elizabeth was in her at bloom mr enlist had been forced into the introduction 
he was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the law 
and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable and every plan in his favour was confirmed 
he was invited to lynch hall 
he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year 
but he never came 
the following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeable again encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come

the hint was immediately taken up r shepherd whose interest was involved in the city of sir walters stretching and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would he done without a change of abode 
a since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate he had no temple he aid 2 in confusing his judgment to be entirely on that side 
it did not appear to him that sir walters could materially alter his style of living in a home which had ouch a character of hoepitnlitynnd ancient dignity to support 
in any other place sir waters might judge for himself 
and would he looked up to at relating the mode of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household 
sir werter would quit lynch hall 
and after a very few day more of doubt and indecision the great question of whither he should go wan settled and the 26 outline of thin important change made out 
there had been three alternations london 
bath 
or another house in the country 
all annie s whither had been farther linger 
a small house in their own neighbourhood where th might still have lady runell's society still he near army and still have the pleasure of persuasion 
2 sometimes seeing the him and grave lynch was the object of her ambition 
but the natural fate of anyone attended her in having something very o tess from her inclination fixed on 
she disliked th wind did not think it agreed with her 
and bath wan to be her home 
sir water had at list thought more of london 
but mr s rod felt that he could not he turned in london had been skilful enough to did him from it end make bath preferred 
it was a much after place for a gentleman in his predicament he might there be important at comparatively little expenses 
two material advantages of both over london had of course been given all their weir hat inmate convenientdiuanee from lynch only fifty miles and lady runell’l spending tome part of every winter there 
and to the very great infection of lady russell whose list view-entire rejected change had been for bath 
sir water and elizabeth were induced to believe that they should snare neither consequence nor enjoyment by getting there 
lady russell felt obliged to opposite her dear anne’known vials 
it would he too much to expect sir water to descend into a bull home in hit own neighbourhood 
arre himself would have found 
the niortlﬁcationl of it more than the foresaw and to sir walters feeling 
they must have been dreadful 
and with regard to angel dislike of bath he considered it s a prejudice and mistake mining hint from the circumstance of her having been three yard at school there after her mother's death 
and secondly from her happening to he not in perfectly good spirit the only winter which ill 
had agrwnrde spent there with herself 
lady russell wan fond of bath in about and dipped toothpick true auitthern all

it kellynclt lodge every danger would be avoided 
and it was in fact i change which must do both health and limit good 
anyone had been too little from home too little teens 
her spirits were not high 
a larger society would improve them 
she wanted her to he more known 
the nndeainbleneu of any other house in the name neighbourhood for sir walters will certainly much lengthened by one part and a very material part of the scheme 
which had been happily engraved an the beginning 
he was not only to quit his home but to ice it in the hand of others i trial of fortitude which manger head than sir water s have found too much 
lynch hall wan to be let 
thin however was a profound secret not to be breathed beyond their own circle 
sir walters could not have borne the degradation of being known to delight letting his hook 
mr shepherd had once mentioned the word 
advice but never dared approach it again 
sir walters upturned the idea of its being offered in any manner 
forbid the list hint being dropped of hit having inch an intention 
and it wan on y on the apparition of hit being ntaneoualy solicited by name root unexceptionable appa cant on his arm terms and up a great favor that he would let it at i 
how quick come the reaction for apt roving what we like 
lady russell had another excess eat one at hand for being extremely glad that sir water and his family were to remove from the country 
elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy which the wishes to see interrupted 
it was with a laugh of mr shepherd 
who had returned after an unprolpenonl morris e to her father home 
with the additional burden of two children 
she wan i clever young woman who understood the art of placing 
oh art of pleasing inn at persuasion 
i s lynch hall 
and who had made herself in uncertainly w millions a to have been already myself there more than once in spite of all that lady ruse who thought it n friendship quite out of place could hint of action and relieve 
lady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth and menaced to love her rather became she would love her than because elizabeth deserve it 
she had never received from paramore than outward mention nothing beyond the observances of complaining 
lad never succeeded in any point which ill 
wanted to army against previous inclination 
she had been sadly very earnest in trying to get annie inches in the visit to london lend open to in the injustice and all die credit of the eel h lmngernenu which shut her out and on many lesser occasional had endeavoured or give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgment and experience 
but always in vain elizabeth would go her own way 
and never had he pursued it in more decided opponu'on to lady russell than in chin selection of my clay 
turning from the moiety of lo deserving a line to bestow her edition and conscience on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility 
from duration man clay was in lady runell’o minute a very unequal and in her character she believed i very dangerous companion 
and a removal that would leave my clay behind and bring i choice of more irritable intimatewithin mint elliot'l reach wan therefore an object of ﬁrm-rate importance

that 3 
a mistake leave to observe sir walters laid mr shepherd one morning at lynch hall at he laid down the newspaper that the potent juncture in much in our favour 
thin peace will be turning all our rich naval offices ashore 
they will be all wanting a home 
could not be 4 better time sir water for having a choice of tenants very responsible tenant many a noble fortune ha been made during the war 
if a rich admirably were to come in our way sir walters 
a he would be i very lucky man s herd d sir walters 
2 that i all i have to reel er a prize indeed would lynch hall be to him 
rather the greatest prizes all let him have taken ever to many before 
hey she herd 
mr shepherd laughed n he knew he mun at this and then added 
— a i pommel to observe sir waters that in the way of business gentlemen of the heavy are well to deal with 
i have had a little knowledge of their method 
of doing business 
and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are an likely to make desirable tenant nut any let of people one should meet with 
therefore sir alter what i would take leave to suggest it that if in consequence of any rumour 
getting abroad of our intention 
which must be contemplated a a possible thing became we know how difficult it in to keep the action and delight of one part of the world from the notice and curiously of the other 
confidence has its tax 
i john shepherd might conceal any family-matter that i choose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me 
but sir walters enlist has eyes upon him which it may be very persuasion 
l 7 difficult to elude 
and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some memoir of the truth should get abroad 
in the w ration of which as i was going to observe since appa cautions will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to 
and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of reply nag 
sir waiters on y nodded 
but soon afterwards rising and pacing the room he observed magically there are new among the gentlemen often have i imagine who would not be surprised to and these m in a house of this description 2 they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune a said my clay for mrs clay was present her father had driven her over nothing being of so much use to mrs claps health as a drive to lynch but i quite agree with my father in thinking s tailor might be a very desirable tenant 
i have known a good deal of the profession 3 and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways l these valuable pictures of yours sir water if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe 
everything in and about the house would be taken such excellence of l the gardens and ahruhheries would he kept in almost as high order all they are now 
you need not be afraid miss slit of put own sweet gower gardens being neglected 
as to all that rejoined sir walters coolly 2 supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it 
i am not particularly to favour a tenant 
the sky would be open to him of mum and few wavy o cart or men of any other description can have had such a range 
but what restrictious i s persuasions 
might impose on the are of the plenum-grenade it another thing

all the mr o attraction on either side might have been enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love 
but the encounter of ouch lavish commendations could not fail 
they were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and deeply in love 
it would be difficult to lay which had seen highest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest the in receiving his decorations and proposes or he in having them accepted 
a short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a shot one 
troubles noon arose 
sir waiters on being applied to without actually withholding hill consent or ca nag it should never be gave it all the negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter 
he thought it a very degrading alliance 
and lady russell though with more temper and pardonable pride received it as a most unfortunate one 
arre enlist with all her claims of birth beauty and mind to throw herself away at nineteen 
involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself to recommend him and no 
hope attaining allluerme but in the chance of a most uncertain profession and no confession to secure even hit farther rise in that profession would be indeed i throwing away which she grieved to think of l annie enlist so young

such confidence 
powerful in in own warmth and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it mun have been enough for anyone 
but lady usually saw it very differently 
his languid temper and fearless of mind operate very differently on her 
she law in it but an aggravation of the evil 
it only added a dangerous character to himself 
he wan brilliant he wan headstrong 
lady russell had little not for wit and of anything approaching to imprudence a honor 
she deprecated the complexion in every ghost 
such opposition at these feelings produced was more than anyone could combat 
young and gentle ohe wan it might at have been possible to within her ﬁlthcr'l ill-will though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her finger 
but lad russell whom the had always loved and relied on co d not with such readiness of opinion 
and such tenderness of manner be continually dividing her in vain 
she was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing indiscreetly improper hardly capable of success and not deserving it 
but it we not a merely selfish caution under which she acted in putting an end to it 
had the not imagined himself consulting lull good even more than her own she could hardly have given him up 
the belief of persuasion

a few month had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance 
but not with a few months ended annual share of suffering from it 
her attachment and regret had for a in time clouded every enjoyment of youth and an early foot of bloom and print had been their lasting effect 
more than seven year were gone since thin little history of sorrowful interest had reached in close 
and time had softened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him but he had been too dependent on time alone 
no aid had been given in change of place except in one visit to bath soon after rupture or in any novelty or entanglement of society 
no one had ever come within the lynch circle who could bear a comparison with frederick wandsworth i he wood in her memory 
no second attachment the only thorough 
natural happy and ancient cure at her lime of mist had been possible to the nice tone of her mind the faan'diuuaneu of her taste in the small limit of the society around them 
she had been solicited when about two-and-twenty to change her name by the young man who not long afterward found a more willing mind in her young er litter and lady russell had averted her a for charles muegmve was the eldest son of a man whose landed property and general importance were second in that country only to sir waters and of good character and appearance 
and however lady russell might have c 2s

she did not blame lay unwell he did not blame herself for having been guided by her

she wapenuaded that under every disadvantages of din approbation at home and every anxiety attending hill pa caution all their probable fears delay and dilapntmenu the should yet have been i happier woman in maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of it

she had only say lists and newspapers for her authority but the could not doubt his being rich 
and in favour of hi 
company she had no man to believe him married 
how ell sent could anyone enlist have been 
how eloquent at cut were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment 
and a cheerful confidence in purity again that over-anxioua caution which seem to insult exertion and diurnal providence 
she had been forced into prudence in her youth the learned romance 4 the grew older the natural qualm of an unnatural be naming 
it all these circumstances recollections and feelings she could not hear that captain wentworth’a i'll was likely to live at kill cash without a revival of former pain 
and many a trot l and many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea 
she often told herself it was full before the could harden her nerves sufficiently to fee the continual discussion of the cross and their business no evil 
she war suited however by that perfect indifferent and apparent unconacioueneu among the only three of her own friend the secret of the part which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it 
she could do justice to the nuts purity of lad ruuell’s motives in this over those of her father elizabeth 
ll could honour all the better feelings of her calmness 
but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung 
and in the event of admirable cross really asking lynch hall the rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her of the part being known to those three only among her so runsmsrorr 
connection by whom no syllables the believed would ever be whilperedﬁnd in the trultthatnmonghigthe brothers with whomhehadbeenreidinglud received any information of their than-lived engagement

the killer n raft had then been out of england icoonrpanyin her husband on a foreign station end her own sister mary had been at school whilst all occurred 3 and never admitted by the pride of name and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge of it afterward 
with these moors the hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the cross which with lady russell still redder in lynch and mary taxed only three miles oil must be anticipated need not involve any particular awkwardness 
thear 17 
n the morning a intend for admirable and my craft seeing lynch hall annie found it met natural to take her almost daily walk to lady ruuell’a and keep out of the way till all was over 
when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them 
thin meeting of the two retie proved highly satisfactory and decided the who e business at once 
each lady wan previously well dispelled for in agreement and saw nothing therefore but good manners in the other 
and with regard to the gentlemen there was inch an hearty good humour such an open musing liberality on rsnsussrou 
31 the admirable side as could not but influence sir walters who had besides been scattered into his very best and most fished behaviour by mr shepherd assurances of his bang known by report to the animal as a model of good breeding 
the house and grounds and furniture were approved the cross were approved terms time every thing and every body was right 
and mr shepherd clerks were set to work without there having been a single luminary difference to of a that 
this in nature showeth.” sir walters without hesitation declared the animal to be the sweet-looking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to by that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where 
and the admit with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife as they drove back through the park 
i thought we should soon come to a deal my clear in spite of what they told us at taunting 
the bayonets will never set the thames on are but there seems no harm in him 
reciprocal compliments which would have been esteemed about 2 ll 
the cross were to have possession at michaelmas 
and as sir walters proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement 
lad russell convinced that anyone would not be allow to be of any use or any importance in the choice of the house which they were going to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she 
might convey her to bath herself after christmas 
but having engagements of her own which must take her from kill much for several weeks she was unable to give the fun invitation she wished and annoy 82 mason

and annoy glad to be thought of acme use glad to have anything marked out an a duty and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country and her own dear country readily a reed to my 
this invitation o april removed all lady russell difficulties and it was cone nearly noon settled that anyone could not go to bath tip l lady russell took her and that all the intervening time should be divided between a cross cottage and lynch lodge 
so far a wan perfectly right 
but lady russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the clench hall plan when it hunt on her which was mimic clambering engaged to go to bath with sir water and elizabeth an a most important and valuable assistant to the persuasion 
31 latter in ill the business before her 
lady russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered grieved and feared 
and the front it contained to anyone in mrs clay s being of so much use while anyone could be of none was i very sore aggravation 
arre herself was become hardened to such nﬂ'ronu but she felt the importance of the arrangement unite st keenly a lady russell 
with a great deal is quiet observation and a knowledge which she often wished less of her father s character the was sensible that results the most serious to his flaming from the intimacy were more than possible 
she did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind 
mrs clay had reckless and a projecting tooth and s clumsy wrist which he was continually making severe remarks n in her absence 
but the was young and certainly rat gather ill-looking and possessed in an acute mind and sinuous pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merelypersnnal might have been 
arre was so impressed by the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it pears bible to her sister 
she had little hope of success t elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself should never she thought have reason to reproach her for giving no warning 
she spoke and seemed only to offend 
elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantly answered for each parts perfectly knowing their situation 
a mrs clay said she warmly d never forgets who she is 
and an i am rather better acquit with her sentiments than you can be i can assure you that upon the of marriage they are particularly nice and that she reprobates all equality of condition and rank more 8d nasuasrou

you must have heard him notice man clay reckless 
a there is hardly any personal defect replied annie 2 which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to

an grumble manner may out off handsome features but can never alter plain ones 
however at any rate at i have a great deal more at stake on thin point than anybody elm can have i think it rather unnecessary in you to he advising me

elizabeth 
though reaming the suspicion 
might yet be made observant by rat 
the last choice of the four carriage-poles war to draw sir walters mint elusion and mrs clay to bath 
the party drove off in very good spirit 
sir walters prepared with condescendingly how for all the afflicted tenantry and content who might have had a hint to pnsussron 
31 how themselves and annoy walked up it the same time in a sort of desolate tranquillity to the lodge where he was to spend the tint week 
her friend was not in better lpll'lll than herself 
lady russell felt this brakes of the family exceedingly 
their respectability was as dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become serious by habit 
it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds and still worse to anticipate the new herds they were to fall into 
and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of to altered i village and be out of the way when admirable and mrs craft limp arrived she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up annie 
accordingly their removal was made together and annoy was set own at uppermost cottage in the list stage of lady russell van 
uppercrou was a moderate-sized village which a few years back had been completely in the old english style containing only two houses interior in appearance to those of the women and labourers 
the mansion of the squire with its high walls great gates and old trees substantial and nnmodernized and the compact tight parsonage enclosed in its own neat garden with a vice and a palm-tree trained round it casements 
but upon the marriage of the young squire it had received the improvement of a farm-house slavered into i cottage for his residence and unperilous cottage with its veranda french windows and other prettiness was quite as likely to catch the travellers eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the great house about a quarter of a mile farther on 
here anyone had often been staying 
she knew the ways of uppermost as well as those of lynch 
the two families were so continually meeting so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's house at ill 26 newnsrou

though better endowed than the elder linger mary had not assent understanding nor temper

she had no resources or longitude

she was now lying on the dead tops of the pretty little drawing-room 
the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing tray under the influence of four manner and two children 
and on assent appearing greeted her with 
a so you are come at hm 
i began to think i should never see you 
i am to ill i can hardly speak 
i have not seen a creature the whole morning 
d i am sorry to and you unwell replied annie 
b you tent me such a good account of yourself on thursday

i always do but i was very far from well at the time 
and i do not think i ever was to ill in my life at i have been all this morning very unfit to he left alone i am tore 
soup pots i were to he seized of a suddenly in tone dread ull way and not able to ring the hell i so lady russell would not get out 
i do not think the hat been in this house three time that turner 
arre said what was proper and enquired after her husband

i have not seen him since seven o'clock 
he would go though i told him how ill i was

iamreyoui have not seen a tool thin whole long morning 
you have had your little boy with you i d eyes an long an i could bear their noise 
but they are so unchangeable that they do me more harm than good 
little charles does not mind i word i any and alter it growing quite as bad 
a well you will noon be better now a replied annie cheerfully 
you know i always cure you when i come 
how are your neighbour at the great home e 
i can give you no account of them 
i have not seen one of them to-day except mr grove 
who just stopped and spoke through the window but without getting all hit home 
and though i told him how ill i was not one of them have been near me 
it did not happen to suit the main marvel i suppose and they never ut themselves out of their way 
ou will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone 
it in early 
d i never want them i assure you 
the talk and laugh a great deal too much for me 
oh 
excuse i am in very unwell 
it was quite unkind of you not to come on thunday.” 2 my dear mary recollect what comfortable account you lent me of yourself 
you wrote in the cheerful manner and aid you were perfectly well and in no hurry for me 
and that being the case you must be aware that my will would be to remain with lady russell to the last and besides what i felt on her account i have all been so busy have had it much to do that i could not very conveniently have left kill much sooner a ear me 
what can joan possibly have to do 2 d a great many things i assure you 
more than i can recollect in a moment 
but i can tell you some 
i 88 persuasion 
velveteen making i duplicate of the catalogue of my other books and i have been several times the men with mackenzie trying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeth plants are for lady russell 
i have had all my own little son 
term to arrange book and music to divide and all my trunk pack from not having underfoot in time what wan intended as to the wagon and one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying nature going to almost every house in the parish up a son of takelenve.. i was told that they wished it 
but all these things took up i great deal of time 
a oh well i 
and after a momentary pause 2 but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the pools yesterday 
did you go then 
i have made no inquiries because i concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party 
oh yes 
i went 
i was very well yesterday 
nothing at all the matter with me till thin morning 
it would have been strange if i had not gone 
do i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party 
nothing remarkable 
one always known beforehand what the dinner will be and who will be there 
and it it to very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one own 
mr and my grove took me and we were in crowded 
they are both 10 very large and take up so much room 
and mr grove always rite forward 
so there was i crowded into the back meat with henrietta and louisa 
and i think it very likely that my illness to-day may be owing to it a little farther perseverance in patience and foamed cheerfulness on annals aside produced nearly a cure on to 
she could noon at upright on the sofa and begun to hope the might be able to leave it by dinnerpersuasion 
31 time 
then forgetting to think of it she was at the other end of the room testifying a nosegay 
then she ate her cold melt 
and then she war we enough to i little walk 
a where shall we go 
a said the when they were ready 
hi you will not like to call it the gem house before they have been to lee you 
d i have not the smaller 
objection on that account 2 replied annie 
i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as men and the mist mummies 
b c 
oh 
hatty ought to call upon you as soon as possible 
they ought to feel what in due to you an m defer 
however we may as well go and sit with them a little while and when we have got slut over we can enjoy our walk anyone had always thought such a style of intercourse highly in debt 
but she had ceased to endeavour to check it tom believing that though there were on each side continual subjects of offence neither family could now do without it 
to the get home accordingly they went to sit the frill half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour with a small upset and shining floor to which the present daughter of the house were usually giving the proper sir of conclusion by a grand piano-forte and a harp ﬂower-stands and little tables laced in every direction

they were of consequence at home and iamuritea abroad 
arre always contemplated them at some of the happiest creature of her acquaintance but still avoid as we all are by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyment

charles grove was civil and agreeable 
in tense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation or grace to make the past as they were connected together at all a dangerous contemplation 
though at the lame time anyone could believe with lady swell that a more equal match might have greatly improved him 
and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to ill 
calmer and more usefulness irrationality and elegance to hit habit and pursuing 
a it was he did nothing with much zeal but sport 
and his time was otherwise trilled away without benefits from books or anything else 
he had very good spirit which never seemed much affected by his wife occasional lonely bore with her unrealonablcnm sometimes to assert watson 
2 admiration and upon the whole though there war very often a little diugreernent in which the had sometimes morerhuethanuhewinhed being appealed to both parties they might put for a happy couple 
they were a way perfectly agreed in the want of more money and i strong inclination for a handsome present from his father 
but here an on most topics he had the superiority for while mary thought it a great than that such a t was not made he always contented for his fast i having many other use for slily money and a right to mend it ud be liked 
as to the management of their children he theory war much better than hit wife and his practice not no bad 
i could manage them very well if it were not for marks interference wan what annie often heard him lay and had a good deal of faith in 
but when listening in turn to mary reproach of a charles la the children so that i can not get them into any of er 4 the never had the intellect temptation to lay a very true

d i wish you could penal e mary not to always fancy g herself ill ways charles language

i am sure annie if you would you might persuade him that i really am very ill 
a great deal worse than i ever own

and given them to much trash and sweet things that the are our to come back lick and cross for the rent o the day 
and my reprove took the list opportunity of being floor with annas to my 2 oh i mine annie i can not help wishing my charge had a little of your method with that children 
they are quite different 
creatures with you 
but to here in general they are no spoil it in a pity you can not put your litter in the way of managing they are a one healthy children s ever were seen poor little dean 
without partiality 
but my charles known no more how they should be treated 
l blew rue 
how troublesome they are sometimes 
i nature you mind annie it prevent my wishing to toe them it our home it often at i otherwise should 
i believe my charm it not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener 
but you know it ll very bad to have children with one that one in obliged to be checking every moment 
do n't do this a and do n't do that 
a or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than in good for them 4 she had this communication moreover from mary 
a mr grove think all her servant to stay that it would be high union to call it in question 
but i am sure without exaggeration that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid instead of being in their business are gadding about the village all along 
i meet them wherever i go 
and i declare i never go twice into my nursery without feeling something of them 
if jim were not the truant steadiness creature in the world it would be enough to spoil her 
for she tells me they are always i tempting her to take a walk with them 
e and on n muegrove’l ride it was a i make 3 rule of never interfering in any of my daughter-in-law conceal for i know it would not do 
but i shall tell you persuasion 9 mint annoy because you may be able to set things to right 
that i have no very good opinion of my charles nursery-maid i hear mange stories of her 
the in plays upon the glad 
and from my own knowledge i can declare the in such a line-dressing lady that the in enough to ruin any servants the come near 
my charles quite mean by her i know 
but i just ve you this hint that you may be upon the watch 
use if you see anything miss you need not be afraid of mentioning it again 
it won mary s complaint that my grove wuveryapt not to give her the presence that her due when they dined at the great home with other families 
and the did not lee any remain why the wutobeconlidered to much it home one lone her place 
and one day when anyone wan walking with only the main mulgrovee one of them after talking of unity people of rank and jealousy of rank laid a i have no scruple of observing to you how noneensical some persons are about their place become i the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it 
but i with anybody would give mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if the were not to very tenacious especially if she would not be always of putting herself forward to take place of moral 
nobody doubts her right to have presence of me but it would be more becoming in her not to be always raining on it 
it ll not that man came about it the lent in the world but i know it is taken notice of by many per 
none how was annas to let all these matters to rights 
she could do little more than linen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each to the other 
give them all hint of the forbearance necessary between ouch near neighbour and make shone hint broadest which were meant for her interred benefit

but the believed they should not have done to well without the eight of mr and mr muegrvve’l able form in the virtual places or without the talking laughing and singing of their daughters 
he played a great deal better than either of the main muegrovee but having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parents to sit by and fancy themselves delighted her performance wan little thought of only out of civility or to refresh the other as the war well aware 
she knew that when the played the was giving pleasure only to herself 
but this was no new sensation 
excepting one short period of her life the had never since the age of fourteen never since the loan of her dear mother known the happiness of being listened to or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste 
in magic she had been always used to feel alone in the world 
and mr and my mulgrnve’e fond partiality for their own daughter performance and total indifference to any other persons gave her much more pleasure for their lakes than mortification for her own

the craft took communion with true naval alert and were to be used 
mary deplored the necessity for herself 
a nobody knew how much the should suffer

and as it chanced that mrs craft fell to the share of anyone while the animal sat by mary and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little ha i 
she was well able to watch for a likeness and if it fair ed her in the features to catch it in the voice brain the turn of sentiment and expression 
mrs craft 
though neither tall nor fat had a squareness uprights and vigour of form which gave importance to her person 
she had bright dark eyes good teeth and altogether an agreeable face 
though her reddened and weather-beaten complexion the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem to have lived some yearn longer in the world than her real eightand-thirty 
her manners were open easy 
and decided like one who had no distrust of herself and no doubts of what to do 
without any approach to coarseness however or any want of good humour 
arre gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration towards herself in all that related to kellyneh and it pleased her especially a she had stationed herself in the very warm half minute in the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest s m in of any knowledge or supper in on mrs cross idlers give a bias of an sort 
she was quite easy on that head and consequently y full of enough and courage till for a moment electrified by mrs cross is suddenly saying 
a it was you and not your sister i and that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this country 
arre hoped she had lived the age of blushing 
but the age of emotion she certainly had not

she could now answer as she ought 
and viii happy persuasion 
4 to feel when my raft s next word explained it to be mr wandsworth of whom the spoke that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother 
she immediately felt how reasonable it was that mrs craft should be thinking and speaking of edward and not of frederick 
and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former ne labours present state with proper interest 
he re 
was all tranquillity 
till just as they were she heard the animal ay to mary 
— a e are expecting a brother of my cross here soon 
i dare any you know him by me 
he was cut short by the eager attack of the little boys clinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go 
and being too much engrossed by proposal of carrying them away in his coat pocket em to have another moment for fishing or recollect what he had begun annie we left to persuade herself an well an she could that the name brother must still be in question 
she could not however reach such a degree of certainly as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house where the cross had previously been calling 
the folk of grat house were to spend the evening of this day the cottage 
and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot the coach wan beginning to be listened for when the youngest mice strove walked in 
that she was coming to apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves war the first black idea 
and ma was quite ready to be aﬁ'ronted when louisa made a 4 right by saying that the only came on foot 
to leave more room for the harp which was bringing in the carriage

i will tell you why the in out of spirit 
hen the craft called this morning they called here afterwards did not they vi they happened to ray that her brother captain arnsworth 
ll just returned to england or paid or something and in coming to see sh almost directly 
and most unluckily it came into mamma head when they were gone that wandsworth or something very like it was the name of poor richard psalm at one time 
i do not know when or where but a great while before he died poor fellow and upon looking over his letters things the found it war no and it perfectly ants that thin most be the very man and her head it quite full of it and of poor richard i so we must all be an merry ii we can that the may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things the real crrcumnancea of thin pathetic piece of family hunters were that the muagrovea had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome hopeless son and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year 
that he had been sent to sea because he wan stupid and unchangeable on shore 
that he had been very little cared for at any time by bit family though quite at much at he deserved 
seldom hard of and parcel at all regretted when the intelligence of hit death a road had worked in way to uppercrou two year before 
he had in fact though his line were now doing all they could for him by calling him a poor richard d been nothing better than a thick-headed unfeeling unprofitable dick grove who had never done anything to entice himself to more than the appreciation of hit name living or dead

that in to lay the only two disinterested letter all the mist had been mere i dictation for money 
lo each letter he had upo well office captain 
but yet no little were they in the habit of attending to inch pattens no unobservant and curious were they i to the name of men or chips that it had made scarcely any impression at the time 
and that my mauve should have been suddenly muck thin very day with a recollection of the name of benton an connected with her in seemed one of those extraordinary hum of mind which do sometimes occur 
she had gone to her letters and found it all as the supposed 
and the perpetual of these letters after so long an interval her poor in gone for ever and all the strength of hi fault forgotten had arrested her spirit exceedingly and thrown her into greater grief for him than ill 
had known on list hearing of hi 
death 
mr grove wan in a lesser degree affected likewise 
and when they reached the cottage they were evidently in want crest of being listened to new on thin object and afterwards of all the relief which cheerful companions could give 
to hear them talking so much of captain wandsworth repeating his name to often puzzling over put can an at last ascertaining that it night that it probably would turn out to be the very same captain wandsworth whom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back from linton

up to leaving the little boy both ther and mother were in much too rug and recent alarm to hear the thought

charles trove indeed afterwards thawed more of inclination 4 the child wagons on to well and he wished to much to be introduced to captain wandsworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening

they were gone 
the hoped w happy haweveroddl conltructedmch happiness might seem 
as for herself the was left with a may sensation of comfort 
i were perhaps ever likely to he hen 
she knew herself to be of the hut utility to the child 
and what wan it to her if frederick wandsworth were only half a mile milum making himself gentle to other 
she would have liked to know how he felt an to a meeting 
perhaps indifferent 
if indifference could exist under inch circumstances 
he mun be either indifferent or unwilling 
had he wished ever to see her again he need not have waited till thin time 
he would have done what he could not but believe that in hit place the should have done long ago when even had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting 
her brother and time came back delighted with my new acquaintance and their visit in general 
there had been music singing talking laughing ill that wan mont agreeable 
charming manner in captain wandsworth no shine or starve 
they seemed all we know each other perfectly and he was coming the very next morning m hook with curled 
he was in come persuasion 
31 to hreakl'an but not at the cottage though that had bunpmpoeedat list 
butter hehadbeen precepts come to the great home invalid and he seemed afraid of being in my charles muagrove’l way on account of the child and therefore somehow they hardly knew how it ended in charles being to meet him to breakfast at his father 
arre understood it 
he wished to avoid eyeing her 
he had inquired after her she found slightly as might suit a former alight acquaintance teeming to acknowledge each a she had a sledge actuated perhaps by the me view of escaping introduction when they were to meet 
the morning hours of the cottage were always later than those of the other houses end on the marrow the difference was no great that mary and anyone were not more than beginning breakfast when charles came in to ray that they were just setting of that he was come for his dogs that his sister 
were following with ca n wandsworth 
his rim meaning to visit mary an the child and captain wandsworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenience 
and though charles had answered for the children being in no such state an could make it inconvenience wandsworth would not be satiated without hi running on to give notice 
mary very much gratified by this attention was delighted to receive him while a thousand feelingnrahed on anna of which thin won the most confusing that it would noon be over 
and it vials noon over 
in two minute after charles preparation the other a red 
they were in the drawing-room 
her eye met captain wentworth’l a how a comely pulled 
the heard his voice 
he talked to mary nip all that war right said something to the main manoir grown enough to mark an easy footing

all all must be comprised in it and oblivion of the 
how natural bow opening tool it included my a third part of her own life 
alas 
with all her morning the mind that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing 
now how were his sentiments to be read 
wan hairlike wishing to avoid her 
and the next moment the w hating herself for the folly which melted the question 
on one other moon which chapel her unrest wind might not have prevented was noon spared all w 
for after the main mummies had returned and finished their visit it the cottage the had this iponhneoua information from mary 
captain wandsworth it not very gallant by you a nnsmssrou 
6d annie though he we 
so attentive to me 
henrietta asked him whet he thought of you when they went away and he laid b you were it flattered he should not have known you again a mary had no feeling make her respect her bitter in a common way hut ill was perfectly unnupieimn of being indicting any uglier wound 
mastered here knowledge annie fully submitted in plenty deep mortification 
doubled it we no and he could take no revenge for he wan not altered or not for the one 
she had already acknowledged it to herself and he could not think defend let him think of her ii he would 
no the yearn which had damped her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manly open look in no prospect lessening his moral adnnmgeu 
she had seen the lame frederick arnsworth 
so altered that he should not have known her again 
a these were words which could not but dwell with her 
yet the soon began to rejoice that the had heard them 
they were of smothering tendency 
they allayed agitation 
they composed end consequently mun make her happier

there was a momentary expression in ca n wandsworth s face at this speech a certain ace of his bright eye and curl of his handsome month which convinced annie that indeed of sharing in mrs musgmve's kind wishes as to her son he had probably been at some closet rid of him 
but it was transient an in algernon of self-amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself 
in mother moment he was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterward coming up to the sofa on which she and mrs mus ve were sitting 
took a place by the latter and enter into conversation with her in a low voice about her in doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace st ther the kindest consideration for all that was real and unsound in the parents feelings 
they were actually on the same sofa for mrs grove had most readily made room for him they were divided only by m roved 
it was no insignificant barrier indeed 
my glove was of a comfortable substantial size infinitely more petted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment 
and while the agitation of manners slender form and pensive face may be considered as very completely screened captain wandsworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat fighting over the destiny of a son whom alive nobody had cared for 
personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proposing 
a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in dee affliction as the most graceful net of limbs in the world 
but fair or not fair there are unwelcoming conjunction which reason will agonize in vain 
which taste can not tolerate 
which ridicule will seize

he defended himself though professing that he w d never willingly admit any ladies on board a ships of his excepting for n bull or a visit which n few flour might comprehend 
but if i know myself a said he a thin in from no want of gallantry toward them 
it is rather from feeling how impmeihle it is with all one effort and all one sacrificed to make the accommodations on board such an women ought to have 
there can he no want of gallantry admired in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort ago and thin in what i do 
i hate to hear of women on board for to ace them on board 
and no chips under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it this brought his desert upon him 
a oh l frederick 
but i can not believe it of you 
— all idle refinement 
women may be as comfortable on board an in the belt home in england 
i believe i have lived a much on board as most women and i know nothing superior to the accommodation of a man-of-war 
i declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at lynch hall with a kind how to anyone d beyond what i always had in most of the chin

such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board a my dear frederick you are talking quite idly 
pray what would become of ur poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to one port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feeling 4

if he were a little t by inch universal ouch eager admission who could wonder 10 there were come of the thought which occupied annie while her finger were mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together equally without error and without con-cioulneu

421 trying to trace in them the mind of the face which had once charmed him 
and out she knew that he must have spoken of her 
she was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer 
but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether miss enlist never danced 
the answer was a oh no never 
she has quite given dancing 
she had rather play 
she is never tired 3 playing 
once too he woke to her 
she had left the instrument on the dancing being over and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the miss groves an idea of 
intentionally she returned to that part of the room 
he saw her and instantly rising said with studied politeness 
d i beg your pardon madam this is your seat 
e and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative he was not to induced to sit down again 
arre did not wish for more of such looks and speeches 
his cold politeness his ceremonies grace were worse than anything

captain wandsworth was come to lynch as to a home to stay as in as he liked being as thoroughly the object o the admirable fraternal kindness as of his wife's 
he had intended on first arriving to proceed very soon into sh mire and visit the brother settled in that country 
but e attraction of uppermost induced him to put this off 
there was so much of friendliness and of fatter and of everything must bewitching in his reception there 
the old were so hospitable the young so agreeable that he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take all the charms and perfection of edward wife upon credit i little longer

wptherﬁnreruting terms in their new theirgnaa 6d their and dawdling about in 3 way not endurable to a thin pomp driving out in a i ate added to their enablinth g g g. y hitherto there had been but one son of captain wandsworth among the groves ada 
their dependence 
it was unvarying warm admiration everywhere 
but thiindrnate footing war not more than established when a certain charlehayter returned among them to he a good deal disturbed by it and to think captain wandsworth very much in the way 
charles hatter was the eldest of all the confined and i very amiable pleasing young man between whom and henrietta there had been a oonridemble appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworth'i introduction 
he war in order and having a curacy in the neighbourhood where residence war not tired lived up his father home only two mile fwd-nub ems 
a short absence from home had left lull fair one guarded by his attention at thin critical rod and when he came back he had the pain of adding very follered manners and of seeing captain wandsworth 
my grave and an oyster were timbers 
they had each had money but their marriage had made a mute difference in their degree of consequence 
mr later had come property of hit own but it wan inrigniﬁcnnt compared with mr mulgmve'e 
and while the summer were in the cat clank of society in the memory the young hatters would from their parents inhale 
retired and polished way of living and their am defective education have been hardly in any can punsuuron 
421 at all but for their connection with up across this elegant can of comic accepted who had c n to be a scholar and a gentleman and who won very superior in cultivation and manner to all the rent 
the two family had always been on excellent there there being no pride on one tide and no envy on the other and only much a conncioumcel of superiority in the mist groves at made them pleased to improve their causes 
charles attendant to henrietta had been observed b her father and mother without any dies solution 
twould not be a great match for her 
butt henrietta lifted him a 
and henrietta 9 
seems to like him 
henrietta fully thought no herself before captain wandsworth tame 
but from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten 
which of the two sister was preferred by captain wandsworth wan as yet quite doubtful as far as anna observation reached 
henrietta was perhaps the prettiest louisa had the higher lpll'ltl 
and the knew not new whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him 
mr and mrs reprove either from seeing little or from an entire confidence in the direction of both their laughter and of all the young men who came near them seemed to leave everything to take its chance 
there was not the smallest up assurance of solicitude or remark about them in the garden-house 
but it was different at the cottage the using couple there were more disputed to regulate an wonder 
and captain wandsworth had not been above four or have times in the main mutgrovea’ company and charles chapter had but just rent paused when anyone had to listen to the opinion of her brother and either an to 1000 was the one liked but 
charles gave it for louisa mary for henrietta but quite agreeing that to have him marry either would be extremely delightful 
4d persuasion 
charles 
had never been i pleasanter nun in his life 
and from what he had once heard captain wandsworth hinuelfuy war very cure that he had not made lea than twenty thousand pound by the war 
here war a fortune at once beside which there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war 
and he was rare captain wandsworth war a likely a man to dinner herself at any office in the heavy 
oh 
it would i spires match for either of hit time 
upon my word it would replied mary 
a dear me 
if he should let to any very great honor if he should ever he made i baronets lady wandsworth a round 
very well 
that would be a noble thing 
indeed for henrietta 
she would take place of me then and henrietta would not dislike that 
sir frederick and lady wandsworth 
it would be but a new creation however and i never think much of your new creation it united mary bent to think henrietta the one preferred on the very account of charles hatter whose retention she wished to see put an end to 
she looked down very decidedly upon the hatter and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed 
very sad for herself and her children 
you know a rapid the d i can not think him at all a t match for henrietta 
and considering the alliance which the moreover have made the bar no right to throw herself away 
i do not think any young woman ha 
a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and convenient to the principal part of her family and be giving had convictions to those who have not been used to them 
and my who in charles hunter 
nothing but a country curate 
a most improper match for mrs grove of uppererou 
her husband however would not agree with her rmussrou 
77 here 
for besides having a regard for his cousin charles hatter was an eldest son and he saw things as an eldest son himself 
now you are talking nonsense mary c was therefore his answer 
a it would not be a pen match for henrietta but charles has a very fair chance through the spires of getting something from the bishop in the course of a year or two 
and you will please to remember that he is the eldest son 
whenever my uncle dies he steps into very pretty property 
the estate at winter is not less than two hundred and fifty acres besides e farm near taunt which is some of the best land in the country 
i grant you that an of them but charles would be a very shocking match or henrietta and indeed it could not be 
he is the only one that could be possible 
but he is a very good-natured good sort of a fellow 
and whenever outcrop comes into his hands he will make a different sort of lace of it and live in s ve different sort of way 
an with that property he will 
never be a contemptible man 
good freehold property 
no 
no 
henrietta might do worse than many charles hatter 
and if she has him and louisa can get captain wandsworth i shall be very well satisﬁed.” 2 charles may say what he pleases cried mary to anyone as soon as he was out of the room 
but it would be shook so have henrietta marry charles hatter i ve be thing for her and still worse for m g and the tore it is very much to he wished that captain wandsworth may soon put him quite out of her head and i have very little doubt that he has 
she took hardly any notice of charles hatter yesterday 
i wish you had been there to see her behaviour 
and as to captain wandsworth s liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsense to say so 
for he certainly rim like henrietta a great deal the best 
but charles is so positive 
421 pnnsussmn 
i wish you had been with us rested for then you might have decided between us 
and am sure you would have thought as i did unless you had been determined to give it against me 
a dinner at mr mus rovers had been the occasion when all these things shout d have been seen by annie 
but she had said at home under the mixed plea of a headache of her own and some return of indisposition in little charles 
she had thought only of avoiding captain wandsworth 
but an escape from being appealed to as empire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening 
as to captain wentworth’s views she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister or preaching his own honour than that he should prefer henrietta to louisa or louisa to henrietta 
either of them would in all probability make him an affectionate humoured wife 
with regard to charles hatter she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman and a heart to |pgilrathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned 
but enrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings the alteration could not be understood too soon 
charles chapter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin behaviour 
she had too old i regard for him to be so wholly strange as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from uppermost but there was such a change as became very alarming when such a man as captain wandsworth was to be regarded as the probable cause 
he had been ailment only two sundays and when they parted hid left her interested even to the height of his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy and obtaining runsussron 
421 that of uppermost instead 
it had then seemed the object nearest her hurt that dr harley the rector who for more than fort years had been zealous discharging all the duties of his office but was now rowing too infirm for many of them should be quite used an engaging a curate 
should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford and should give charles hate the promise of it 
the advantage of his having to come only to uppermost instead of going six miles another war 
of his having in every cuts a better curacy 
of his belonging to their dear harley 
and of dear good dr harley s being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most curious fatigue had been a great deal even to louisa but had been almost everything to henrietta 
when he came back all the zeal of the business was gone louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had held with dr shirk she was at the window looking out for ca team wandsworth 
and even henrietta had at best on y a divided attention to live and seemed to have forgotten all the former don t and solicitude of the negotiation 
well i am very glad indeed 
but i always thought you would have it 
i always thought you sure 
it did not appear to me that 
in short you know dr harley mus 
have a curate and you had secured his promise 
ii he coming louisa 
a one morning very soon after the dinner at the groves at which anyone had not been present captain weutworth walked into the drawing-room it the cottage where were only herself and the little invalid charles who was lying on the sofa 
the surprise of bending himself almost alone with annie enlist deprived his manners of their usual composure he started and could only say a i thought the 82 masuasron 
miss groves had been here mrs grove told me i should and them here before he walked to the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behave 
they are upstairs with my sister they will be down in a few moments i dare say a had been annals reply in all the confusion that was natural 
and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him she would have been out of the room the next moment and released captain wanton as well as herself 
he continued at the window 
and after calmly and politely saying a i hope the little boy is better c was silent 
she was obliged to kneel down by the sofa and remain then to satisfy her patient 
and thus they continued a few minutes when to her very great satisfaction she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule 
she hoped on turning her head to see the master of the house 
but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy 
charles hatter probably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain lventworth than captain wandsworth had been by the sight of anyone 
she only attempted to say how do you do 
will not you sit down 
the others will be here presently 
captain wandsworth however came from his window apparently not indisposed for conversation 
but charles hatter soon put an end to his attempts by stating himself near the table and taking up the newspaper 
and captain wandsworth returned to his window 
another minute brought another addition 
the younger boy a remarkable stout forward child of two years old having got the door opened for him by some one without made his determined appearance among pluuuron’ 
s them 
and went night to the safe to see what wan going on and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away 
there being nothing to be eat he could only have some play 
and hi aunt would not let him tease hillock brother he began to fasten itself upon her an the knelt in such a way that busy as the win about charles the could not choke him oil she spoke to him ordered streams and assisted in vain 
once she did contrive to 12th him away but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly

in another moment however she found herself in the state of being released from him 
name one was taking him from her 
though he had bent down her head to much that his little curdy hand were unfastened from around her neck and he was resolutely borne away before she knew that captain two had done it 
her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless 
she could not even thank him 
she could only hung over little three with molt disordered feelings 
his kindness in tapping forward to her relief the manner the silence in which it had passed the little particular of the circumstance with the conviction noon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making wide the child that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks and rather sought to satisfy that her conversations wan the last of hi wants produced such a 82 persuasion 
conditions of varying but agitation at the could not recover from till by the entrance of mary and the main groves to truth over her little patient to their cares and give the room 
she could not my 
it might have been an opportunity of watching the love and jalouliel of the fair 
they were now altogether 
but the could any for none of it 
it was evident that clerics hatter was not well inclined towards captain “'cntworth 
she had a strong ii prevention of hi having laid in a vast tone of voice after captain wentworth'l interference b you ought to have minded nut walters 
i told you not to tune ur it s 
and could comprehend his n-gretu'ng that pa 
in wandsworth should do what he ought to have done himself 
but neither charles haytel’t feelings nor mybody’l feelings could interest her till he had a little better arranged her own 
she wan ashamed of myself quite ashamed of being to fervour to overcome by such a trifle 
but to it war and it required a long application of solitude and reflections to recover her 
churned ther opportunities of making her observation could not fail to occur 
anyone had noon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion though too wine to acknowledge at much at home 
where the knew it would have wliuﬁcd neithzrhmband nor wife 
for while the confidence louisa to be rather the favourite she could not but think mul far at the might llll’l‘ to judge from memory and experience that captain wandsworth was not in love with either 
they were more in love with him 
yet there it war not love 
it won a little fever pnsmtsrorv 
k of admiration 
but it might probably must end in love with some 
charles hatter seemed aware of being lighted and yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them 
arre longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about and of pointing out some of the evil they were expecting tlienuclm to 
she did not 
attribute guile to any 
it war the highest satisfaction to her to believe captain wanton not in the least aware of the pain he was occasions 
there was no train h no pitiful triumph in bill 
manner 
he had p lay never heard and never thought of any claim of charles hatter 
he only wrong in a thing the mentions for accepting must be the word of two young women at once 
after a short struggle however charles hatter seemed to quit the old 
three day had passed without his coming once to uppercrou 
a most decided change 
he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner 
and having been found on the occasion by mr grove with some large book 
before him mr and my grove were sure all could not be right and talked with grave faces of hi studying himself to death 
it war marys ho and belief that he had received a positive minarﬁorn henrietta and her husband lived under the constant independence of seeing him to-morrow 
anyone could only feel that charles hunger was wise 
ne morning about this time charles mauve and captain wandsworth being gone shooting together at the sister 
in the cottage were sitting quietly at work they were waited at the window by the shutters from the 
eating-house 
it wan a very line november day and the mill grovel came through the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to say that they were going 84 persuasion 
to take i long walk and therefore concluded mary could not like to go with them 
and when mary immediately lied with tome beauty at not being opposed n g walked a oh yes 
i should like to join you very much i am very fond of a long walk 
a annie felt 
persuade by the look of the two girls that it was precisely what they did not wish and admired again the son of necessity which the family habit yearned to produce of everything being to be communicated and everything being to be done together however undesired and convenient 
she tried to dissuade mary from going but in vain 
and that being the cane thought it beat to accept the main grovel much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise a she might be useful in turning back with her ill and lessening the interference in any plan of their own 
d i can not imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walk said mary an she went up mint 
a everybody in any supposing that i am not a good worker 
and yet they would not have been please if we had refused to join them 
when people come in this manner on purpose to ask us how can one my no 2 
just at they were letting off the gentleman returned 
they had taken out a young dog which had spoilt their sport and sent them back early 
their time and strength and irises were therefore exactly ready for thin walk no they entered into it with pleasure 
could anyone have foreseen web a junction the would have amid at home 
but from name feelings of interest and curiosity he fancied now that it war too late to retract and the whole six not forward together in the direction chosen b the miss mulgl'ovel who evidently considered the way it an under their guidance 
angels object was not to be in the way of an body 
and where the narrow path across the old made many nnsmtsxon 
85 nations necessary to with her brother and 3 
her plruu'ry in drink must arise from the exercise and the day from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand polemical descriptions extant of autumn that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness that reason which has drawn from every poet worthy of being read some attempt at description or some lines of feeling 
she occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations 
hut it villas not possible that when within reach of captain wandsworth s conversation with either of the miss muscles she should not try to hear it 
yet she caught little very remarkable 
t was me live y chat such as any young persons on an intimate footing might fall into 
e was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta 
louisa certainly ut more forward for his notice than her sister 
this distinction appeared to increase and there was one speech of louisa which struck her 
after one of the man praises of the day which were continually bursting forth captain wentwortlt added 
what glorious weather for the animal and my sister they meant to take i long drive this morning 
perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills 
they talked of coming into this side of the country 
wonder whereabouts they will upset today 
oh it does happen very often i assure you 
but my sister makes nothing of it 
she would as live be tossed out it not aah 
you make the most of it i know cried louisa 
but lit were really so i should do just the same in her place 
if i loved a man an she loves the animal i would always be with him nothing should ever separate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely by anybody else 
6d szsuasrorr 
it wan potter with enthusiasm 
2 had you i 
cried he catching the lame tone 
i honour you 
e and there wan silence between them for a little while 
anyone could not immediately fall into a quotation again 
the sweet scents of autumn were for a while put by unless some tender rent fraught with the apt apology of the declining year with declining happy new and the images of youth and hope and ring all gone together 
blasted her memory 
she so here to nay ll they struck by order into another th 2 ii not thin one of the way i to wintry 
a git nobody heard or at least nobody answered her 
winter however or it 
environs 
jar young men are sometimes to be met with troubling about near home 
wan their destination 
and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosure where the plough at work and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteract the sweet of poetic despondence and meaning to have spring again they gained the summit of the most considerable hill which parted upper and winter and noon commanded a full view of the latter at the not of the hill on the other side 
winter without beauty and without dignity stretched before them an indifferent house standing low and hemmed in by the barn and building of a farmer 
y mary exclaimed 2 18th me 
here in winter 
i declare i had no idea 
well now i think we had better turn back 
i am excessively tired 
henrietta conscious and ashamed and feeling no cousin charles walking along any th or leaning against any gate war ready to do an new wished 
but no l a mad charles grove and no no i d cried louisa more eagerly and taking her finger aside mum 
to be arguing the matter warmly 
reasus’sron 
87 charles in the meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt now that he was so near 
and very evidently though more fearfully t nag to induce his wife to go too 
but this was one o the points on which the lady showed her strength 
and when he recommended the advantage cheating herself a quarter of an hour at wintry as she felt so tired he resolutely answered a oh no indeed 
walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good 
and in short her look and manner declared that go she would not 
after a little succession of these sort of dates and consultations it was settled between charles and his two sisters that he and henrietta should run down for a few minutes to see their aunt and cousins while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill 
louisa seemed the principal stranger of the plan 
and as she went a link way with them down the hill still talking to henrietta mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her and saying to caution wandsworth 
a it is very unpleasant having such connexion-l but i assure you i have never been in the house above twice in my life 
she received no other answer than an artificial asserting smile followed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which annie perfectly knew the meaning of 
the brow of the hill where the remained was a cheerful t louisa returned 
an mary lending a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her 
but when louisa drew cupid wandsworth away to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedgerows and the were gone by degrees quite out of right and sound very was happy no longer she quarrelled with 88 rusmsxou 
her own seat was sure louisa got a much better somewhere and nothing could prevent her from going to look for at better also 
she turned through the name the but could not see them 
arre found a nice out it her on a dry sunny bank under the hedgerows in which the had no doubt of their fill being in tome or other 
mary at down for a moment but it would not do 
the wan lure louisa had found a better teats nowhere else and the would go on till she overtook her 
arre really tired herself wan glad to sit down 
and ohe ve noon heard captain wandsworth and louring in the h grow behind her an if making their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down the centre 
they were pelting no they drew near 
i louion’t voice wan the list distinguished 
she yearned to be in the middle of tome eager speech 
what annie ant heard was 
and to i made her go 
i could not bear that the should be friar hastened from the visit by ouch nonsense 
what 
would f be turned back from doing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right by the air and interference of such i person or of any person i my my 
no i have no idea of being i can persuade 
when i have made up my mind i have made it 
and henrietta teemed entirely to have made up hero to call at wintry to-day 
and yet the was ll near giving it up out of romantical come lances b c she would have turned back then but r you 2 b c she would indeed 
i am almost ashamed to say in 
a happy for her to have such a mind at yourself at handful after the hint you give just now which lid but 
confirm my own observations the lust rim 4 won in company with him i need not aspect to have no comprehending of what it going on 
i see that more than i mission 
89 mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question 
and woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequence when they are placed in circumuaocesrequiring fortitude and strength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this 
your sister is an amiable creature 
but your is the character of decision and dimness i see 
if you value her conduct or happiness infuse as much of your own spirit into her as a can 
but this no doubt you have been always going 
it is the worst evil of too yielding and indecision a character that no influence over it can be depended on 
you are never sure of a good impression being arable 
everybody may sway it 
let those who would be happy be arm 
here is a nut d said he catching one down from an upper bough `to exemplified s beautiful glossy out which blessed with origin strength hu'outlived all the storms of autumn 
not picture not a weak spot anywhere 
this nut he continued with pal ful so enmity a while so many of its brethren have far less and been trodden under foot is still in possession of all the heap unless that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of hen returning to his former earnest tone 
a my first wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be arm 
if louisa grove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life she will cherish all her resent powers of mind 
e had done and was unanswered 
it would have surprised annie if louisa could have readily answered such i speech words of such interest spoken with such serious warmth 
she could imagine what louisa was feeling 
for herself she feared to move lest she should be seen 
while she remained a hush of low warbling holly protected her and the were moving on 
before they were 
beyond her hearing however louisa spoke again 
4 reasussrou 
mary is good-natured enough in many respects said she 
a but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense and pride 
the split pride 
she has a great deal too much of the split pride 
we do so wish that charles had married annie instead 
i you know he wanted to marry anyone e a later a moment s pause captain wandsworth said 
a do you mean that she refused him 
a job 
yes 
cecily 
when did that happen p 
i do not exactly know for henrietta and i were at school at the time 
but i believe about a year before he married ma 
i wish she had accepted him 
we should all have liked her a great deal better 
and papa and remorse always think it 
was her great friend lady russell doing that she did not 
they think charles might not be learned and bookish enough topics lady russell and that therefore she persuaded annas to refuse him the sounds were retreating and annoy distinguished no more 
her own emotions still kept her taxed 
she had much to recover from before she could move 
the listeners proverbs fate was not absolutely hers she had heard no evil of herself but she had heard a great deal of very painful import 
she saw how her own chance was considered by captain wandsworth and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation 
as soon as she could she went after mary and have 
in found and walked back with her to their former station by the stile felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected and once more in motion together 
her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give 
charles and henrietta returned bringing as may be 
hush 
a 9 i conjectured charles hatter with them 
the minutiae of the main anyone could not attempt to understand 
even captain wandsworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here 
but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman's tide and a relenting on the lady s and that they were now very glad to be together again did not admit a doubt 
henrietta looked a little ashamed burnt very well pleased 
— charles hatter exceedingly happy end they were devoted to each other almost m the list instant of their all getting forward for uppercrou 
everything now marked out florida for captain wandsworth nothing could be plainer 
and where many division were necessary 
or even where they were not they walked idle by side nearly an much as the other two 
in a long of meadow land where there was ample grace for l 9 were undivided forming three distinct parties 
a to that party of the three which booted lent animation and lean compliance annie necessarily belonged 
she charlie and mary and was tired enough to be very glad of charles other arm 
but charles though in very good humour with her wan out of temper with his wife 
mary had shown herself obliging to him and was now to reap the corn spence which consequence we hit drown her inn most every moment to cut oil the hen i of some settled in the hedge with hip witch 
and when mary began to complain of it and lament her being ill-used according to custom in being on the hedge side while annie was never incommoded on the other he the m of both to hunt after a vessel which he had a momentary glance of and they could hardly get him alone it all 
this long meadow bar end a lane which their footpath at the end fit wan to cross and when the party and all reached the gate of exit 
the carriage advancing 6d 9 rensussron 
in the same direction which had been some time heard was just coming up and proved in be admirably cross gig 
he and his wife had taken their intended drive and were returning home 
upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired 
it would have her full a mile and they were going through uppercrou 
the invitation was general and generally declined 
the miss mummies were not at all tired and mary was either offended by not being asked before any of the others or what louisa called the split pride could not endure to make a third in a one-horse chaise 
the walking party had crossed the lane and were surmounting an opposite stile and the animal was putting his horse into motion again when captain wandsworth cleared the hedge in a moment to any something to his sister 
the something might be guessed by its effects 
v amiss enlist i am sure you are tired cried my craft 
a do let us have the pleasure of taking you home 
here is excellent room for three i assure ou 
if we were all like you i believe we might sit our 
you must indeed you must 
arre was still in the lane and though instinctively beginning to decline the was not allowed to proceed 
the animal s kind urgency came in support of his wife s the would not be refused they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner and captain wandsworth without saying a word turned to her and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage 
yes 
he had done it 
she was in the carriage and felt that he had placed her there that his will and his hands had done it that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue m his resolution to give her rest 
she msuasrou 
31 wan very much affected ivy the view of his disposition towards her which all these thing made apparent 
thin little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before 
she understood him 
he could not forgive her but he could not be unfeeling 
though concerning her for the pack 
and considering it with high and unjust resentment though perfectly careless of her and though becoming attached to another still he could not see her earlier without the desire of giving her relief 
it wan a remainder of former sentiment 
it was an impulse of me though acknowledged friendship 
it was a pool he own warm and amiable heart which she could not contemplate without emotions ago compounded of pleasure and pain that the knew not which prevailed 
er answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companion were at list unconsciously given 
they had travelled half their way along the rough lane before the was quite awake to what they said 
she then found them talking of a frederick 2 he certainly mean to have one or other of than two girls sophy d said the animal 
a but there in no laying which

this was against her 
button the other hand he spent so much of persuasion 
31 time at uppercron that in removing thence the might be considered rather an leaving him behind than a going towards him 
and upon the whole she believed the nuts on thin interesting question be the gainer almost an certainly a in her change of domestic society in leaving r mary for lady russell

but ohe wan yet more anxious for the possibility of lady swell and ca taint wandsworth never meeting anywhere 
they not like each other and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good and were lady sell to see them together she might think that he had too much belong and she too little

her useful to little charles would always give some awectneulto the i memory of her two months visit there but he was gaining strength pace and the had nothing else to my or 
the conclusion of her visit however was diversion in a way which she had not at all imagined

a letter from his friend captain saville having found him out it in

quite unknowingly within twenty miles of each other

the young people were all wild to lee lame 
captain arnsworth talked of going there again himself it war only seventeen miles from uppercrou 
though november the weather war by no man had 
and in short soul who war the most eager of the eager having formed the resolution to go and beside the pleasure of doing as she liked being new armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer

but to this mr grove for the take of his homely would not content

they were consequently to my the night there and not to be expected cook till the next day dinner 
this war felt to be a considerable amusement 
and though they all met at the great home at rather an early breakfast hour and net off very punctually it was so much part noon before the two carriages mr mutgrove‘a coach containing the four ladies and charles hurricane in which he drove captain wandsworth were descending the long hill into lame and entering upon persuasion

captain wandsworth v turned in to call on his friend 
the others walked on and he was to join them on the cobb 
they were by no means tired of wondering and admiring 
and not even louisa leaned to feel that they had parted with captain wandsworth long when saw him coming after them with three companions l well known already by description m be captain and my horrible and a captain wick who was laying with them 
captain benvill had tome time ago been lit lieutenant of the laconic 
and the account which eg thin wandsworth had given of him on his return from lame before his warm prime of him an an excellent young man and an office 
whom he had always valued highly which must have me him well in the esteem of every dinner had been foil owed by a little history of being private life which rendered him perfectly interesting in e eyes of all the ladies 
he had been engaged to captain harville’a instep and we now mourning her longer 
they had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion 
fortune came he prize 
mane an lieutenant being great 
promotion too came at n but fanny saville did not live to know it 
she had died the preceding summer while he wan at lea 
captain wandsworth believed it impossible for man to be more nusuasron 
31 attached to woman than poor benvill had been to fanny saville or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change 
he confirmed his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily uniting very strong feelings with quiet serious and retiring manners and a decided taste for reading and sedentary reuss 
to finish the interest of the story the fricnd’e‘hip between him and the articles seemed if possible augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance and captain buck was now living with them entirely 
captain saville had taken his present house for half a year 
his taste and his health and his fortune all directing him to a residence inexpressive and by the sea 
and the grandeur of the country and the retirement of lame in the winter appeared exact adapted to capture benwiclt’u nape of mind 
the sympathy and good-will excited towards captain brick was very l c and yet a said annas to herself as they now moved forward to meet the party he has not perhaps more sorrowing heart than i have 
i can not believe his property is blighted for ever 
he is younger than i am

younger as i man 
he will rally again and be happy with another they all met and were introduced 
captain saville wan a all dark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lame 
and from among features and want of health looking much older than captain wandsworth 
captain benvill looked and war the youngest of the three and compared with either of them a little man 
he had a leaning face and a melancholy air just at he ought to have and drew back from conversation 
captain saville though not equally captain wandsworth in manners was a perfect gentleman unaffectedly warm and obliging 
mrharville i degree roof persuasion 
lea polished than her husband yearned however to have the lame good feelings and nothing could he more plenary than their desire of considering the whole party no friend 
of their own became the friend of captain wandsworth or more kindly hospitable than their cntmtiee for their all promising to dine with them 
the dinner already ordered at the inn wan at last though unwillingly accepted an an excuse 
but they seemed almost hurt that captain wandsworth should have brought any such party to ye without considering it at a thing of course that they should dine with them 
there was to much attachment to captain wandsworth in all this and ouch a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality to uncommon 30 unlike the usual style of givevand-take invitations and drier of formality and did lay that anyone felt her spirits not likely to he bent by an increasing acquaintance among hug hrother-oiﬁeert

anyone had a moment astonishment on the subject herself

captain saville was no reader

but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within

they went back to dress and dine 
and so well had the scheme answered already that nothing was found amiss 
though its being a so entirely out of the season and the d no thoroughfares of ye and the d no expectation of corn any had brought many apologise from the heads of inn 
arre found herself by this time owing so much more hardened to being in captain \gentworth’s coming on persuasion 
pony than the had at list imagined could ever be that the sitting down to the tame table with him now and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it they never got beyond what become a mere nothing 
he nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow but captain neville had promised them a visit in the evening 
and he came burying his friend also which was more than had been expected it having been agreed that captain brick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the pretence of to many strangers 
he ventured among them again however though hit spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the part in general 
while captain north and horrible led the talk on one ride of the room and by recurring to former days supplied anecdotes in abundance to occur y and entertain the others it fell to annals lot to placed rather apart with captain llcnwick 
and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him 
he was thy and disposed to abstraction 
but the songs nag mildness of her countenance and gentleness of her manner soon had their effect 
and annoy was well repaid the art trouble of exertion 
he was evidently a young man of considerable tune in reading though principally in poetry 
and besides the sensation of having given him at least an evening indulgence in the discussion of subjects which his usual companion had probably no concern in the had the hope of being of real use to him in some tug getting at to the duty and benefit of struggling against affection which had naturally grown out of their conversation 
for though shy he did not seem reserve it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to hurt their usual restraints 
and having talked of poetry the richness of the present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the ﬁrttrrate poem trying humour 
104 ascertain whether mutations tbeladyqflbelah were to be preferred and how ranked the glass and the bride of 1500 and moreover how the glamour was to be pronounced he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other 
he repeated with such tremulous feeding the various lines which imaged a broken heart or a a mind destroyed by wretchedness and looked so surely as if he meant to he understood that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry and to say that the thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely 
and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparing 
his looks showing him not pained hut pleased with this allusion to his situation she was symbols end to go on 
and feeling in herself the right 
of security of mind she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study 
and on being requested to pnmculatizc mentioned such works of our best moralist such collections of the nest letters such memoir of clusters of worth and suffering as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurance 
casting bcnwiclr listened attentively and seemed grate us for the interest implied 
and thou h with a shake of the head and sighs which delay his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his noted down the names of those she recommended and promised to procure and read them 
when the evening was over anyone could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to ye to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had my numa 
overseen before

one and henrietta ending themselves the earlier of the party the next morning agreed to pull down to the tea before breakfast 
they went to the ends to watch the lowing of the tide which i line south-westerly breeze wan bringing in with all the grandeur which is at a chorus admitted 
they piled the morning 
gloried in the tea 
sympathized in the dell hat of the fresh-feeling breeze 
and were silent 
till enrietta suddenly began again with 
oh yell i am quite convinced that with very few exceptions the despair always dues good 
there can be no doubt of in having been of the greatest service to dr shirk faster still illness last spring twelvemonth 
he disc am himself that coming to ye for a month did him more good than all the medicine he took 
and that being by the lea always make him feel young again 
now i can not help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the tea 
i do think he had better leave uppercroa entirely and xl at lame 
do not you annie 
do not you agree with me that it in the hen thing he could do both for himself and my harley 
she has cousin here you know and many acquaintance which would make it cheerful or her and i am sure the would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand in case of hi having another seizure indeed i think it quite melancholy to have much excellent a 
a al.1414915 mum 
mtnsussron 
100 people as dr and mrs harley who have been doing good all their lives wearing out their last days in a place like uppermost where excepting our family they seem shut out from all the world 
i wish his friends would propose it to him 
i really think they ought 
and as to procuring a sensation there could be no difficulty at his time of life and with his character 
my only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish 
he is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions 
over-scrupulous must say 
do not you think annie it is being overscrupulous 
do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience when a clergyman sacrifice his health for the sake of duties which may be as well performed by another mean 
and at ye too only seventeen miles or he would be near enough to hear if people thought there was anything to complain of anyone smiled more than once to herself during this speech and entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man though here it was good of a lower standard for what could be altered but general acquiescence 
she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business 
felt the claims of dr sharply to repose as she ought 
saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man as a resident curate and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident carters being married 
i wish said henrietta very well pleased with her companion d i wish lady russell lived at 
uppermost and were intimate with dr harley 
i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody i always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything 
i am afraid of her as i told you before quite afraid of 1100 passion 
lumber-hole the ii an veryclever 
but i respect her amazing and wish we had such a neighbour at us scrooge 
no war amused by henrietta’t manner of being grateful and amused also that the course of events and the new interest of henrietta’a views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the muegmve fund 
3 the had only time however for a general answer an a wish that each another woman were at uppercroeg before all subjects suddenly ceased on seeing loving and captain wandsworth coming toward them 
they came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready 
but louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that the had something to procure at a shop invited them all to go back with her into the town 
the were all at her hen they name to the steps leading upward from the back a gentleman at the more moment preparing to come down politely drew back and stopped to give them way 
they mended and passed him 
and no they patted annual face caught his eye and he looked at her with a degree of warmest admiration which the could not be insensible of 
she war looking remarkably well 
her very regular ve retty features having the bloom and fro-linear of yoiiytlrp restored by the line wind which had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of eye which it had also produced 
it was evident that the gentleman corn letter a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly 
pain wandsworth look round at her intently in a way which showed his noticing of it 
he gave her a moment glance a glance of brightness which seemed to ray a hat man in muck with you and even i at thin moment see something like annie enlist again after attending louisa through her guineas and loitering about a little longer they returned to the inn

she had before conjectured him to be a manager like themselves and determined that a mean-looking groom who was troubling about near the two in a they came back should be his servant 
both master and man being in mourning stilled the idea 
it was now proved that he belonged to the same inn themselves 
and thin second meeting about it wan ho proved against by the gendelnan'e lock that he thought her very lovely and by the refined and propriety of his apologise that he wan us m of exceedingly good manners 
he learned about thirty and though not lmndnomc had an agreeable portion 
arre felt that the should like to know who he was 
they had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage almost the list they had heard since entering lame drew half the party to the window

but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door 
somebody must be in away 
it wan driven by n servant in mourning 
he word cunliffe made charles grove jump up that he might compare it with his own 
the tenant in mourning roused annals curiosity and the whole six were collected to look by the time the owner of the uncle was to he been issuing from the door under the bow and civility of the household and taking his seat to drive of

if the servant had not been in forming one should have known him by the livery 
a putting all these ve extraordinary circumstances together a said captain “yentworth 
we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin 
when she could command ma s attention annie quietly tried to convince her that r father and mr enlist had not for man years been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable 
at the same time however it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of lynch was undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good sense 
she would not upon any account mention her having met with him the second time 
luckily mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their early walk but she would have felt quite ill-used by annie 3 having actually rann against him in the passage and received his very polite excuses while she had never been near him at all 
no that possibly little interview must remain a perfect secret 
of course said ma b you will mention our seeing mr split the next time you write to bath 
i think my father certainly ought to hear of it 
do mention all about him 
arre avoided a direct reply but it was just the circumstance which she considered at not merely unnecessary to be communicated but as what ought to be suppressed 
the offence which had been given her father many years back she knew 
eliubeth’s particular share in it she inspected 
and that mr elliot’s idea always produced irritation in both wan beyond a doubt 
mary never wrote to bath herself 
all the toil l i o persuasion

breakfast had not been long over what they were joined by captain and mr horrible and captain brick 
with whom they had appointed to take their lax walk about lame

their conversation the preceding evening did not incline him to seek her again 
and the walked together tome time talking at before of mr it and lord barton and mill at unable at before and a unable as any other two reader to think exactly alike of the merit of either till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their city and instead of captain brick she had chagrin saville by her ride

that i what he did and nobody else could have caved poor james 
you may think miss enlist whether he in dear to us i d annie did think on the question with perfect decision and laid as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish or in his seemed able to bear for he was too much affected to renew the subject and when he 4 golden again it way of something totally different 
n saville s giving it at her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home determined the direction of all the party in what vain to be their last walk 
they would account by them to their door and then mr and set a themselves

to with all the kind love-making and all the kind interchange of invitation and promise which may be imagined they gleamed from captain and my saville at their own not and still accompanied by captain brick who seemed to cling together to the last proceeded to make the pro er adieu to the cobb

there she had listened to heurietta’s schemes for dr shirley’s leaving uppermost 
further on she had first seen mr enlist 
a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but louisa or those who were wrapped up in her welfare 
captain brick was most considerate attentive to her 
and united as they all seemed by the distress of the day she felt an increasing degree of good 
will towards him and a pleasure even in thinking that it might perhaps he the occasion of continuing their distance 
n wandsworth was on the watch for them and a chant and four in waiting stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street 
but his evident 
surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other the change of his countenance the astonishment the six passions begun and suppressed with which charles was stepped to made but a mortifying reception of anyone 
or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to louisa 
she endeavoured to be composed and to be just 
without relating the feelings of an comma towards her henry she would have attended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard for his take 
and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to for she would shrink unnecessary from the office of a friend 
in the mean while she was in the carriage 
he had handed them both in and placed himself between them 
and in this manner under these circumstances full of astonishment and emotion to anyone she quitted lame 
how the long stage would pass 
how it was to dick their manners 
what was to be their sort of intercourse she could not foresee 
it was all quite natural however

their actual speed heights by force dread of the confusion made the road appear but half a long an on the day before 
it was growing quite dusk however before they were in the neighbourhood of uppercrou and there had been total silence among them for some time henrietta leaning back in the corner with n shawl over her face giving the hope of her having cried herself to deep

surely at the union home 3 and ill had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there both an an immediate companion and a emitting in all than arrangement for the future which in mr and my muegrove’u distressed note of prig would have been difficulties 
they had an early account from ye the next morning 
louisa wan much the same 
no symptom wore than before had appeared 
charles came a few hour afterwards to bring a later and more particular account 
he was tolerably cheerful 
a speedy cure must not be ho but everything was going on ill well ii the nature of the cause admitted 
in speaking of the saville he seemed unable to ratify his own senses of their kindness especially of my harville’a exertions a l i 2 matron 
a tune 
she rally left nothing for mary to do 
he and mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last i hit 
mary had been hysterical again this morning 
hen he came away the me going to walk out with captain brick which he he would do her good 
he almost withheld the had prevailed on to come home the day before 
but the truth wet that mrs saville left nothing for anybody to do 
charles wan to return to l me the tame afternoon and hit father had at list half a mind to with him but the ladies could not content 
it wo d be going only to multiply trouble to the others and incites hit own distress 
and a much better these followed and wan acted upon 
a chase was tent for from crewkheme and charred conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family one who having brought up all the children and seen the very last the line eying and loug-petted matter varry tent to season at 
a hit brothers wan now living in her deterred nursery to mend ttocltingt and drew all the blast and bruise the could get near her and who consequently was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa 
vague wishes of getting slash thither had occurred before to mrs strove and henrietta 
but without anyone it would hardly have been resolved on and found practicable to noon 
they were indebted the next do to charles hatter for all the minute knowledge of out which it was to essential to obtain every twenty-four heart 
he made it hit business to go to ye and hit account was still encouraging 
the interval of tents and conscience were believed to be stronger 
every report agreed in captain wentworth't appearing mixed in same 
ann what to leave them on the marrow an event which they all dreaded 
a what should they do without her 
they were wretched comforter for one persuasion 
i 26 other 
and so much was said in thin way that anyone thought the could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which the wan purity and persuade them all to go to ye at once 
she had little difficulty 
it was soon determined that they would go go to-morrow ax tlrcmnelvcn at the inn or get into load gay as it united and then remain till dear louisa cone d be moved 
they must be taking off tome trouble from the and is the war with they might at least relieve re hamlet from the care of her own children and in short they were so happy in the decision that anyone wan delighted with what the had done and felt that she could not spend her lamp morning at uppercrou better than in assisting their preparations and sending them of 
at an early hour though her being left to the solitary range of the house wan the consequence 
she wan the last expect thing the little boys at the cottage the was the vary at the only remaining one of all that had killed and animated both houses of all that had given uppercrou its cheerful character 
a few day 
had made a change indeed 
if louisa recovered it would all be well again 
more than former happiness would be restored 
there could not be i don t to her mind there we none of what would follow her recovery 
a few month hence and the room now so deserted occupied but by her silent 
pensive half miss hat be called again with all that was happy and gay ali that won glowing and bright in rlolgperl'oul love all that was most unlike annie rot an hours come late leisure for such reflection at thee on i dark li‘lovemher day i small thick rain allusion blowing out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the window was enough to make the sound of lady ruuell’a carriage exceedingly welcome 
l ray munro 
and thou h desirous to be gone the could not quit the union cut or look on adieu to the cottage wid its black dripping and eomfonleu veranda or even notice through the misty glance the man humble tenement of the village without a saddened hart 
someone had paced in speech which made it precious 
it modes the record of many lenntiooe of pain once severe but now softened 
and of some instance of relenting feeling borne breathing of friendship and reconciliation which could never be looked for again and which could never ensue to he dear 
she left it all behind her all but the recollection that ouch things had been 
anyone had never entered kill cash since her quitting lady ruuell'a house in september 
it had not been necessary and the few ocouiona of its being points for her to go to the hall ll 
had contrived to eve and escape from 
her lift return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartment of the lodge and to sadden the eyes of in more 
there wan tome anxiety mixed with lad runell'l joy in meeting her 
she knew who had been requesting uppercron 
but happily either annie wan improved in plump and looks or lady russell fancied her to 
and annoy 
in receiving her compliments on the occasion had the agreement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin and of hoping that she was to be pleased with a second spring of youth and lay 
hen they came to conveyed the wan noon sensible of lame mental change 
the subject of which her heart had been full on leaving lynch and which the had felt alighted and been compelled to another among the mulgroveu were now become but of secondary interest 
she had lately sort right even of her father and lines and bath 
their concerns had been sunk under pmussrow 
e s those of uppermost 
and when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears and spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place which had been taken and regret that mrs clay should still be with them annie would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of ye and louisa mushroom and all her acquaintance there 
how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the articles and captain brick than her own father s house in camden place or her own sister's intimacy with mrs clay 
she was actually forced to exert herself to meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude on topics which had by nature the first claim on her 
there was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject 
th must all of the accident at 
ye 
lady russell had not n arrived eve minutes the day before when a full account of the whole had burst on her 
but still it must be talked of she must make inquiries she must regret the import 
hence lament the result and captain wentworth’s name must be mentioned by both 
arre was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell 
she could not speak the name and look straight forward to lady russell e e till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa 
when this was told his name distressed her no longer 
lady russell had only to listen composedly and wish them happy but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure in teased contempt that the man who at twenty-three ha seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an annie enlist should eight years afterwards be charmed by a louisa grove 
the list three or four days passed most quietly with no circumstance to mark them executing the real 26 persuasion 
receipt of a note or two from lure which found their way to anyone the could not tell how 
and thought rather improving account of learning 
at the 
end of that period lady runell'a politeness could repose no longer and the fainter cell-threatening of the st became in a decided tone i must call on mrs rules 
i really instant call upon her soon 
anyone have you count e to go with mead pay a visit in that house 
it wi be some trial to sup both annie did not shrink from it on the contrary the surly felt n the laid in observing 
d i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two 
your feelings are lest reconciled to the change than mine 
by remaining in the neighbourhood i am become insured to it she could have said more on the subject for she had in fact so high an opinion of the shafts and considered her father to very fortunate in hit tenants felt the parish to he to lure of a good example and the poor of the belt mention and relief that however in 
and ashamed for the necessity of the removal the court d not but in conscience feel that they were one who deserved not to stay and that lynch has had passed in better hand than its owners 
these convictions must unquestionably have their own pain and never war it kind 
but they precluded that pain which lady russell would alter in entering the house again and returning through the well-known apartments 
in such moments anyone had no power of saying to herself 
these rooms ought to belong only to us 
oh how fallen in their destination 
how unworthiness occupied an ancient family to he so driven away 
strangers calling their place 
d no except when the thought of her mother and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside she had no sigh of that inscription to heave 
persuasion 
l 26 mrs craft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite and on the present occasion receiving her in that house there via-lparticular attention 
the accident at lame was soon the prevailing topic and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yettennom 
that captain wandsworth had been in kellyncll yesterday the list time since the accident had brought annie the last note which the had not been able to trace the exact steps of 
had said a cow hourly d thenretumedagainto lame and without any present intention of quitting it any more 
he had enquired after her she found particularly 
had ax rested his hope of mice elliot’s not being the worse 
gear her lemons and had spoken of there exertions as great 
this was handsome and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done 
as to the sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of my sensible women whose judgments had to work on ascertained events 
and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtfulness and much imprudence 
t is effect were most alarming and that it wan frightful to think how long minus nfusgrove s recover might yet he doubtful an how liable she would nil remain to out 
d from the concussion hereafter 
the animal wound it all up luminary by exclaiming 
a ay a very bad rosiness indeed 
a new sort of way thin for a young fellow to be making love by breaking hit mistrcae’e head is not it miss enlist 
this in breaking a head and giving a planter snarly 
admirably crot't’u manners were not quite of the tone to suit lad russell but the delighted annie 
his godless old heart and simplicity of characters were irresistible 
18 persuasion 
now thin must be very bad for you laid lie suddenly rousing from n little reverie so be coming and ii king s here 
i had not recollected it before i declare but it 
must be very bad 
but now do not and upon ceremony 
get up and go over all the mouse in the home if you like it 
a another time sir i thank you 
not now a a well whenever it wit you 
you can lip in from the ihruhbery at any time 
and there you will and we keep our umbrella in up by that door 
a good place in not it 
but a checking herself you will not think it a good place 
for your were always kept in the battle 
room 
ay no it always ll i believe 
one mass way 
may be at good a incl-her’l but we all like our own belt 
and no you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for you to go about the home or not r banns pending the might decline it did it very grate e we have made very few changes either continued the admin-4| after thinking a moment 
very few 
we told you about the laundry-door at uppercrou 
that has been a very great improvement 
the wonder wan how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of it opening an it did it long 
you will tell sir alter what we have done and that mr shepherd thinks the greatest improvement the house ever had 
indeed i most do ourselves the justice to any that the few alteration 
we have made have been all very much for the better 
my wife should have the credit of them however 
i have done very little besides tending away jar of the large looking-glass from my dmaing-mom which was your father 
a very good man and very much the gentlemen i am lure 
but i should think miss enlist 
looking with serious reflection i should think he must be rather i nusunsrorw 
421 dreary man for his time of life 
such a number of looking-glass 
oh lord 
there was no getting am from one half 
so i got sophy to lend me a ban and we noon shifted their quarters 
and now i am quite snug with my little shaving-glain one corner and another great thing that i never go near annie amassed in spite herself wan rather distressed for an answer 
and the animal fearing he might not have been civil enough took up the object again to m y the next time you write to your good father minus enlist pray give my compliments and mr 
cross and that we are settled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to and with the lace 
the breakfast-room chimney makes a little grant on but it in only when the wind ll due north and bowing hard which may not happen three time 
a winter 
and take it altogether now that we have been into most of the bonnet hereabouts and an judge there in not one that we like better than this 
pray say no with my compliments 
he will be glad to hear it 
lady panels and scroff were very well pleased with each other but the acquaintance which the visit began was fated not to proceed far at relent 
for when it will returned the grass announced themselves to he going away for a few weeks to visit their complexion in the north of the county and probably might not be at home again before lady russell would be removing to bath 
so ended all danger to anyone of meeting captain wandsworth at lynch hall or of seeing him in comes 
pansy with her friend 
everything was safe enough and she mailed over-shoe many anxious feeling the had wanted on the subject 
1801 persuasion 
chapter 117 
though charles ma had remained at lame much longer after r and my muegrove'l going than anyone conceived they could have been at all wanted they were yet the list of the family to be at home again 
and at noon at possible after their return to us parrot they drove over to the lodge 
they had let r. louisa be sing to lit up 
but her had though clear wan excess tingly weak and her nerve susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness 
and though ill might be enounced to be altogether doing very well it wan nil impossible to say when the might be able to hear the removal home 
and her father and mother who must return in time to receive their younger children for the crimson holidays had hardly a ha of being allowed to bring her with them 
they ha been all in lodgings together 
mrs jungle had got mrs harvillc’r children away i much as the could every possible supply from uppercrou had been finished to li ten the inconvenience to the saville while the artillery had been wanting them to come to dinner every day 
and in hurt it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side at to which should be most disinterested and horrible 
mary had had her evil but upon the whole as wan evident by her staying so long she had found more to enjoy than to taller 
charlehayter had been at l me oftener than invited her 
and when they dined with the saville there had been only a maid-servant to wait and at first mrs saville had always given me grove preference 
but then the had received so very handsome an apology from her on sending out where daughter the was and there had been so much going on every day there had been no many walkmuseum 
2 
between their lodgings and the articles and she had got books from the library and changed them so often that the balance had certainly been much in favour of ye 
she had been taken to chariot too and she had bathed and she had gone to church and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at lamer than at uppermost 
and all this joined to the sense of being so very useful had made really an agreeable fortnight 
arre in tired after captain brick 
mary s face was clouded directly 
charles laughed 
oh 
captain bonnie is very well i believe but he is a very odd young man 
i do not know what he would be at 
we asked him in come home with mr for a day or two charles undertook to ve him come shooting and he seemed quite delight and for my part i thought it was all settled when behold on tuesday night he made a very awkward sort of an excuse 
he never shot a and he had been quite milundemood c and he had promised this and he had promised that and the end of it was i found that he did not mean to come 
i sup so he was afraid of sending it dull 
but upon my wo i should have though 
we were lively enough at the cottage for such a heartbroken man as ca taint benwick.’ charles laugh again and said now ma you know very well how it really was 
it was all your doing a turning to anyone 
e fancied that if he went with us he should and ou close by he fancied everybody to be living in ppercross 
and when he discovered that lady russell lived three mile of his heart failed him and he had not courage to come 
that is the fact upon my honour 
mary knows it is but mary did not give into it very gracious whether from not considering captain brick entitled by birth and situation to begin love with an alsloot or from not want 82 persuasion 
in 
to believe annie a greater attraction to uppercrou than benefit mun be left to be guessed 
angel goodwill however war not to be deafened by what he heard 
she boldly acknowledged himself chattered and confronted her since 
oh he us of you cried chase in arch term 
mary interrupted him 
i declare charles i never heard him mention annie twice all the time wan there 
i declare annie he never talk of you at all 
d no admitted charles d i do not know that he ever does in a general way 
but however it in a very clear thing that he admired you exceedingly 
his head in full of come hooks that he in reading upon your commendations and he wants to talk to you about them 
he he found out something or other in one of them which he thinks 
oh 
i can not pretend to remember it but it umf something very one 
i overheard him telling henrietta all about it 
and then a nice enlist was spoken of in the highest terms now mary i declare it was to i heard it myself 
and you were in the other room 
a ell once sweetness beauty oh 
there war no end of in elliot’l charms 
and i am sure cried mary warmly it was very little to his credit if he did 
miss saville only died last june 
such a heart it very little worth having in it lady russell 
i am cure you will agree with me 
d i mun are coming brick before i decide laid lady russell am my 
e and that you are very likely to do very noon i can tell you ma'am laid charles 
a though he had not nerves for coming away with m and setting off again afterwards to y a formal visit here 
he will make his way over to ellen one day by herself you ma depend on it 
i told him the distance and the road 
persuasion 
i 82 and i told him of the church s being so very well worth seeing 
for an he has a taste for those sort of things i thou hit that would be a good excuse and he listened with l his demanding and soul 
and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon 
so i give you notice lady russell 
a any acquaintance of manners will be always welcome to me a wan lady ruuell’l kind answer 
a oh i an to being anna acquaintance d said mary d i think he it rather my acquaintance for i have been seen him every day thin last fortnight 
a ell as your 
aim acquaintance then i shall be very happy to see pain brick 
b you will not and anything ve agreeable in him i nature you ma'am 
he in one o the fullest young men that ever lived 
he hung walked with me sometimes from one end of the and w the other without saying a word 
he in not at all a half-bred young man 
i am sure you will not like him 
a there we differ mary laid annie 
i think lady russell would like him 
i think the would be no much pleased with his mind that she would very noon see no deficiency in his manners a so do i annie laid charles 
i am sure lady russell would like him 
he in june lady russell s sort 
give him a book and he will read all day long 
yes 
that he will i d replied mary tauntingly 
a he will sit peering over his book and not know when a person speak 
to him or when one drop 
news lesson or anything that happens 
do you think lady russell would like that i 
lady russell could not help laughing 
a upon my word said she 
i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such differ 
once of conjecture needy and matter of fact at i may 8d persuasion 
call myself 
have really ourioitytonee the person who can give union to inch directly opposing notion 
l with he may be indncodlo all here 
and when he does mary you may depend hearing my opinion hulamdeteminednotlojdehimbeforehand.’ b you will not like him 
i will answer for it 
lady russell began talking of something clue 
mary spoke with animation of their meeting with or rather minding mr flit to extraordinary 
he in a man mid lady russell 2 whom i have no wish to lee 
his declining to he on cordial term with the head of his family has left a very mang impressions in his disfavour with me 
this decisive checked mang eagerness and named her short in the midst of the list countenance 
with regard to captain wandsworth though annie hazarded no inquiries there was voluntary communication sufficient 
hi spirits had been greatly recovering lately i might be expected 
a louisa improved he had improved and he wan now nice a different cream from what he had been the 4 week 
he had not seen louisa 
and was an extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview that he did not press for it at all 
and on the contrary seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days till her head was stronger 
he had talked of going down to youth fur a week and wanted to rude captain brick to go with him 
but an hamlet maintained to the man 
captain brick leaned much more disposed to ride over to lynch 
there can be no doubt that lad russell and anyone were both occasionally thinking of captain brick from thin time 
lady russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be hit herald 
nor could anyone return from any stroll of culinary inplnsnssxon 
149 silence in her father s grounds or any visit of charity in the village without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him 
ca rain brick came not however 
he was either ech disposed for it than charles had imagined or he was too shy 
and after giving him a week's indulgence lady russell determined him to he unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite 
the mud rovers came back to receive their ha y boys and from school bringing with them s hsrville’s little children to improve the noise of uppermost and lessen that of ye 
enrich remained with louisa but all the rest of the family were again in their usual carters 
lady russell an annie hid their compliments to them once when anyone caustic not but feel that uppermost was already quite alive again 
though neither henrietta nor louisa nor charles hatter nor captain wandsworth were there the room presented as strong a contrast as could he wished to the last state she had seen it in 
immediately surrounding mrs mushroom were the little hnrvillcs whom she was sedulously guarding from the tay inn of the two children from the cottage expressly to amuse them 
on one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls cutting up milk and gold per 
and on the other were dresses and says hen nag under the weight of brawn and cold pies where rigorous boys were holding high revel 
the whole completed by a roaring christmas which seemed determined to he heard in spite of all the noise of the others 
charles and mary also came in of course during their visit and mr grove made a point of paying his respects to lady russell and sat down close to her for ten minutes talking with i very raised voice but from the clamor of the children on his 226 persuasion 
knees generally in vain 
it was 
a one familiae judging from her own temperament would have deemed ouch a domed hurricane a had restorative of the nerve which louisa illness must have it gently shaken 
but my mule who got annie near her on purpose to thank her most cordially again and again for all her attention to them concluded a short recapitulation of what the had suffered herself by observing with a happy glance round the room that after all the had gone through nothing wan to likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home 
louisa wan now recovering space 
her mother could even thinks of her being able to join their party at home before her brothers and peter 
wept to school again 
the saville had promised to come with her and ray at uppercrou whenever the returned 
captain wandsworth wan gone for the present to are his brother in shropshire 
2 hope i shall remember in future laid lady russell ll soon at the were reflected in the carriage not to call at ppercroel in the christus h idaya.” everybody has their taste in noise as well up in other matters 
and sounds are quite innnxiom or most distressing 
by their sort rather than their quantity 
when lady rum not long afterwards was entering bath on a wet afternoon and driving through the long court of meet from the old bridge to camden place amid the dish of other carriage the heavy rumble of calm and days the bawling of news mufﬁn-men and milking and the centres clink of pattern ugh made no complaint 
no then were noises which belonged to the winter posture 
her spirits rate under their influence 
and like mrs strove she was feeling though not lying that after being long in the russian 
421 count n couldheao forherualittle my mind 200 annie did not there these feelings 
she d in a very determined though very silent define invitation for bath 
caught the hut dim view of the extensive buildings making in mind without any wish of seeing them better 
felt their progress through the meet to be however disagreeable yet too rapid 
for who would be glad to lee her when she arrived 
and looked back with fond regret to the burden of uppercrou and the delusion of lynch 
elizabeth last letter had communicated a piece of new of some interest 
mr enlist war in bath 
he had called in camden place 
had called a second time i third 
had been pointedly attentive 
if elizabeth and her father did not deceive them-clue had been taking an much pain to seek the acquaintance and proclaim the value of the connection at he had formerly taken paint to chow neglect 
thin was very wonderful if it were true 
and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about mr enlist already repairing the sentiment ohe had no lately expressed to ma of ills being a man whom she had no with to ice 
d she had a great with to see him 
if he really caught to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he must he for even for having dismembered himself from the poem tree 
arre wan not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance but the felt that she would rather see mr enlist again than not which was more than she could any for many other persons in bath 
she wan put down in camden place and lady russell then drove to her own lodgings in riven street 
ran 
persuasion 
chapter 117 
is water had taken a we good house in camden place a loft dignity situation such ll becomes a man s consequence 
and both he and elizabeth were settled there much to their satisfaction 
arre endured it with a sinking hart anticipating an imprinnrnent of many months and anxious saying to herself oh 
when shall i leave you again 
a degree of unexpected cordiality however in the welcome the received did her good 
her father and deer were glad to see her for the sake of showing her the home and ﬁimiturc and met her with kindness 
her making a fourth when they sat down to dinner was noticed a an advantage 
my clay wan v pleasant and very ailing but her eourteaiea and uri eyes were more a matter of course 
anyone had any felt that the would pretend what wan proper on her arrival but the complaining of the other was unlocked for 
they were evidently in excellent spirits and the wan soon to linen to the meet 
they had no inclination to linen to her 
after laying out for some compliment of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood which anyone could not pay they had only a few faint inquiries to make before the talk must be all their own 
uppercrou excited no interest lynch very little it were all bath 
they had the pleasure of amusing her that bath more than answered their expectations in every respect 
their home was undoubtedly the belt in camden place their drawing-room many decided advantage over all the other which they had either seen or heard of and the m minority wan not scorn in the at leg of the ﬁtting-up or t taste of the furniture 
heir persuasion 
31 acquaintance wan exceedingly nought after 
everybody wan wanting to visit them 
they had drawn back from many introduction and still were perpetually having card left by people of whom they knew nothing 
here were found enjoyment 
could anyone wonder that her father and thither were hoping she might not wonder but the mun nigh that r father should feel no degradation in his change would see nothing to regret in the quiet and dignity of the accident landowner should find no much to vain of in the littleness of a town 
and the nuts sigh and smiles and wonder too as elizabeth threw open the folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to the other hopping of their space at the possibility of that woman who had been mistress of lynch hall ending extent to be proud of between two walls perhaps thirty feet asunder 
but this was not all which they had to make them ha pay 
they had mr enlist too 
anyone had i great deal to hear of mr enlist 
he was not only pardoned they were delighted with him 
he had been in bath about fortnight 
he had used through bath in november in hit way to lion on when the intelligence of sir walters being settled there had of course reached him though only twenty-four hour in the place but he had not been able to avail himself of it 
but he had now been a fortnight hat in bath and his list object on arriving had been joined his card in camden lilac following it up b lush uniduout endeavours to meet and when they did meet by each great openings of conduct ouch reading to apologize for the pat inch solicitude to he received m a relation again that their former good understanding was completely re-eetablithed 
they had not a fault to and in him 
he had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own k its finder 2 
aside 
it had originated in minpprehenlion entirely 
he had never had an idea of throwing himself of t he had feared that he was thrown off but knew not why and delicacy had kept him silent 
upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or careless of the family and the family honour he wan quite indignant 
he who had ever boomed of being an elusion and whose feeling at to connection were only too stick to suit the unusual tone of the present day 
he wan astonished indeed but his character and general conduct mint refute it 
he could refer sir water to all who knew him 
and certainly the pains he had been taking on thin the fat oop rotundity of reconciliation tube restored w the flooring of relation and heirreeumptive war a strong proof of hit opinion on the estate circumstance of his marriage too were found to admit of much continuation 
thin was an article not to be entered on by himself 
but a very intimate friend of his a colonel willie a highly re stable mint perfectly the gentleman and nor 
an ill boosting man sir walters added who was living in very good style in marlborough buildings and had at his own particular retreat been admitted to their acquaintance through mr else it had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage which made a material difference in the discredit of it 
colonel walls had known mr enlist long had been well acquainted also with his wife had perfectly understood the whole story 
she was certainly not a woman of family but well educated accomplished rich and excessively in love with his friend 
there had been the charm 
she had taught him 
without that attraction not all her money would have tempted elusion and sir walters was moreover nature of her having been a very one woman 
here was a great deal to often the bureau 
a very one woman with a large fortune in persuasion 1/2 love with him sir walters seemed to admit it as complete apology 
and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light she allowed it to be a great extension 
mr enlist had called repeatedly had dined with them once evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for they gave no dinners in 
general 
delighted in short by every proof of cousin notice and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in camden place 
arre listened but without quite understanding it 
allowance large allowance must be made for the ideas of those who spoke 
she heard it all under embellishment 
all that sounded extravagantorimtional in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relations 
still however she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared 
in mr elliot’s wishing after an interval of so many years to be well received by them 
in a worldly view he had nothing to gain by being on terms with sir walters 
nothing to risk by a state of radiance 
in all probability he was already the richer of the two and the lynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title 
a sensible man and he had looked like a cry sensible man why should it be an object to him 
she could only offer one solution it was pity for elizabeth sake 
there might really have a lilting former 
though convenience and accident had drawn him a dim rent way 
and now that he could afford to lease himself he mid hat mean to pay his addresses to her 
elizabeth was certain y veryhsndsome 
with swelled elegant manners and her character might never have been penetrated by mr enlist knowing her but in public and when very young himself 
how her temper and understanding might hear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and its 
watson 
rather fearful one 
most earnestly did the with that he might not be too nice or too servant if elizabeth were hit object 
and that elizabeth wan to believe herself to and that her friend mr lay wan encouraging the idea seemed apparent by a glance or two between them while mr elliot’e frequent visits were talked of 
arre mentioned the glimpses the had had of him at same but without being much attended to 
oh yes perhaps it had been mr enlist 
they did not know 
it might be him perhaps 
they could not linen to her dear ration of him 
they were driving him themselves 
sir walters especially 
he did justice to hit very gentlemanly up see his air of elegance and fashion his good-ways face he sensible eye 
but at the same time a most lament his being wary much undergoing a defect which time seemed to have increased 
nor could he pretend to nay that ten year had not altered almost every feature for the wane 
mr enlist appeared to think that he sir walters war looking exactly n he had done when they last parted 
but sir water had a not been able to return the compliment entirely which had embarrass him 
he did not mean to complain however 
mr enlist was better to look at than most men and he had no objection to he been with him anywhere mr elusion and his friend 
in marlborou h buildings were talked of the whole evening 
co once walls had been to impatient to be introduced to them and mr enlist is anxious that he should l c and there was 3 man walls at present known one to them by description at ill wan in daily expectation of her confinement 
but mr enlist spoke of her an d a most church in woman quite worthy of being known in camden place and at noon ache recovered the were to be acquainted 
sir walters thought much of men will 
nasmsrorr 
421 she was it to he an excessively pretty woman beautiful 
a he longed to see her 
e she might make tome amends for the many very air faces head continually panting in the streets 
lie worst of bath was the number of its plain women 
he did not mean to say that there were no pretty women but the number of the plain wan out of all proportion 
he had frequently observed as he walked that one hand face would be followed by thirty or live-and-thirty fright 
and once as he had wood m a shop in bond street he had counted eighty-seven women go by one after another without there being a tolerable face among them 
it had been a frosty morning to be sure a sharp front which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of 
but still there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath 
and as for the men 
they were infinitely worse 
such scarecrowat the streets were full of 
it was evident how little the women were used to the eight of anything tolerable by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced 
he had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with colonel hollis who was n ne military figure though spiny-haired without observing that every woman eye was upon him 
every woman c was sure to be upon colonel walls 
modest sir alter 
he was not allowed to escape however 
his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting that colonel waists corn onion might have 31 good a figure as colonel walls and certain was not sand hired

or a can would not be liable to any web mine when i knock at the door i need every 
thing 
a knock at the door 
and no steel it was ten o'clock 
could it be mr enlist 
they knew he was to dine in london crescent 
it was possible that he might imp in hit way home to ark them how they did 
they could think of no one else 
my clay decidedly thou hit it mr elliot’l knocking my clay wan right 
it all the state which a butler and postboy could give mr enlist wan slavered into the room 
it was the tame the very same man with no difference but of dress 
arre drew a little back while the others received his compliments and her litter hit apologise for calling at no mutual an hour but a he could not be to near without waiting to know that neither the nor her friend had taken cold the day before am as 
which was all i. politely done and no politely taken ll possible but her part must follow then 
sir walters talked of miss youngest daughter 
a mr enlist must give him leave to present him to all youngest days later there we no occasion for remembering mary 
and annoy smiling and blushing very becoming owed to mr split the retty features which he had by no meant forgotten an instantly ii with amusement at hit little stars of surprise that he had not been at all aware of who the war 
he looked completely astonished but not more astonished than pleased lit cybele brightened 
and with the most reflect thirty he welcomed the relationship allude to the pan and annexed to be revived 19 an acquaintance already 
he was quite as good-looking as he had persuasion 
run petted at lame lull countenance improved by speaking and his manners were to exactly what they ought to be no polished to easy to apply agreeable that she could compare them in excellence to only one penny manner 
they were not the tame but they were perhaps e sally good 
he eat own with them and in raved their conversation very much 
there could no doubt of his being a sensible man 
ten minutes were enough to verify that 
hit tone his expression his choice of subject his knowing where to stop it was all the operation of a sensible discerning mind 
as soon to he could he began to talk to her of ye wanting to compare opinions expecting the place but especially wanting to work of the circumstance of their happening to he guest ii the lame inn it the tame time 
to give his own route understand something of here and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her 
she gave him a short account of her party and business at lame 
his regret increased at he listened 
he had put his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs 
had heard voices mirth continually 
thought they must be a most delightful net of people longed to be with them but certainly without the mallets suspicion of miss mang the shadow of i right to introduce himself 
f he had but asked who the party were 
the name of mir-grove would have told him enough 
a well it would nerve to cure him of to beard practice of never taking a question it an inn which he had adopted when quite e young men on the principle of its being very genteel to be curious 
the notion 
of a young men of one or two and twenty said he so to what ll neoconry in manners e him unite the thing are more absurd i believe than those o my other set of being in the world 
l 26 persuasion 
the folly of the means they often employ in only to he equalled by the folly of what they have in view but he must not be addressing his reﬂectionto annie alone he knew it 
he was noon diffused again among the other and it wan only at intervals that he could return to ye 
his inquiries however produced at length an account of the scene he had been engaged in there soon after hit leaving the place 
having alluded 2 an accident he mun hear the whole 
when he questioned sir water and elizabeth began to question also but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be un 
felt 
she could only compare mr flit to lady runs in the with of really comprehending what had paused and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it 
he said an hour with them 
the elegant little clock on the mantel-piece had struck a eleven with it silver soundly 
and the watchman wan beginning to he heard 19 3 dimness telling the lame talk before mr alsloot or any of them teemed to feel that he had been there long 
anyone could not have supposed it possible that her lift evening in camden place could have passed 30 well 
chapter wur 
here was one point which annie on returning to her family would have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliot’l being in love with elizabeth which war her futhcr’l not being in love with my clay 
and she war very far from easy about it when she had been at home a few hours 
on going down to breakfast the next morning 
the found pirsuasioii‘ 
17 there had just been a decent pretence on the lady's side of meaning to lave them 
she could imagine mrs clay to have said that now miss annie was come she could not suppose herself at all wanted 
for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper that must not be any reason indeed 
i assure you i feel it none 
she is nothing to me compared with you 
and she was in full time to hear her father say a my dear madam this must not be 
as yet you has seen nothing of bath 
b you have been here only to be useful 
you must not run away from us now 
you must stay to beacup'ainted with us walls the beautiful mrs walls 
of our line mind i well know the sight of beauty is a gratiﬁcation.” he spoke and looked so much in earnest 
that anyone was not surprised to see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself 
her countenance perhaps might ax rest some wakefulness 
but the praise of the one mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister 
the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties and promise to stay 
in the course of the same morning ann and her father chancing to be alone to either he began to compliment her on her imps looks 
he thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks 
her skin her complexion greatly improved 
clearer fresher 
had she been using anything in particular 
no nothing 
merely lowland a he supposed 
d no nothing at all 
has he was surprised at that 
and added a certainly you can not do better than continue as you are 
you can not be better than well 
or i should recommend gowns the constant use of scotland during the spring months 
421 clay has been using it at my commendations and you see what it split done for her 
you see how it has carried away her reckless ray reasuaswx 
if elizabeth could but have heard this such personal praise might have struck her especially at it did not appear to anyone that the reckless were at all learned 
but everything mun take in chance 
the evil of the marriage would be much diminished if elizabeth were also to marry 
alas for herself the might always command a home with lady ruse 
lady runeil’a composed mind and polite manners were put to come trial on thin point in her intercourse in camden place 
the eight of marley in inch favour and of anyone i overlooked was a perpetual vocation to her there 
and vexed her ll much when the war away up a person in bath who drinks the water gets all the new publication and hat a very large acquaintance half time to be vexed 
all mr enlist became known to her the grew more charitable or more indifferent toward the other

and on converting with him the found the stolid as fully ai parting the special that the way at first an the to d annie almost ready to exclaim

everything united in him

without pride or weakness 
he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune without display 
he just ed for himself in everything essential without begin 
public opinion in any point of worldly decorum 
he war stead observant moderate 
candid 
never man away with y spirit or by ielﬁahneu which fancied itself rang feeling 
and yet with a iemihility to what wan amiable and lovely and a value for all the felicitous of domestic life which character of fancied enthuiiaarn and violent agitation seldom really poses

ut it had been no use 
to our his mind nor are an noon palirqnct to prevent his thinking afﬁxeecgnrf‘lughoioe 
her at action in mr enlist outweighed all the plague of my clay 
it wan now some years since anyone had begun to learn that he and her excellent friend could iometinieu think differently 
and it did not surprise her therefore that lady ruse should lee nothing auspicious or incontinently nothing to requires more moved than appeared in mr elliot’e great desire of reconciliation 
n lady runell’r view it we 
perfectly natural that mr enlist at a mature time of li should feel it a most definite object and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people to be on good tenant with the head of hi 
family 
the simple process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear and only earrings in the heavy of youth 
arre presumed however still to smile about it and at last to mention 
elizabeth 
lady russell listened and looked and made only this ceuu'oue reply 
elizabeth 
very well 
time will explain it wrap l reference to the future which anyone offer a little observation 
fell the must submit to 
she could determine nothing at present 
in that house elizabeth must be list 
and the was in the habit of such general observances an 
miss enlist 2 that any particulars of attention seemed almost impossible 
mr enlist too it must be remembered killed not been a widower seven month 
a little delay on his ride might be very excitable 
in fact anyone could never lee the creeps round his hat without fearing that the war the inexcusable one in contributing to him much imagination for though his marriage had not been very happy still it had excited to many yells that the could not compare 10s rensuesxon

a b c however it might end he wan without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in bath the saw nobody equal to him 
and it weena great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lure which he seemed to have ll lively a wish to see again and to see more of at himself 
they went through the particular of their first meeting a great many times 
he gave her to understand that he had looked at her with tome untasted 
she knew it well 
and the remembered another poem n't look also 
they did not always think alike 
hit value for rank and confusion the perceived to be greater than hen 
it was not merely compliance it must he a liking to the came which made him enter warmly into her father and little solicitude on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them 
the bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the danger viecountcu dalrymple and her daughter the honourable mist carters 
and all the comfort of no 
— camden place 
was swept away for many days 
for the dalryrnplel in manners opinion most unfortunately were cousin of the enlist 
and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly 
anyone had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility and the nuts acknowledge e herself disappointed 
she had hoped better thing mrs their high ideal of their own situation in life and was reduced n form a with which the had never forgotten 
a with am they had more pride 
for your cousins 
lady trample and miss carters 
b c our contented paltry rice loungers in her care all day long 
sir alter had once been in company with the late mum but had never seen any of the rest of the the difficulties of the case arose from there persuasion 
i s i having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late dismount when in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walters at the same time there had been an unlucky omission at lynch 
no letter of condolence had been sent to ireland 
the neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner 
for when poor lady enlist died herself no letter of condolence was received at lynch and consequently there was but too much reason to s present that the dalrymples considered the relationship as closed 
how to have this anxious business set to rights and be admitted as cousins again was the question and it was a question which in a more rational manner neither lady russell nor mr enlist thought unimportant 
a family complexions were always worth reserving good company always worth seeking 
lady air plea had taken a house for three months in layers lace and would be living in style 
she had been at bath the year before and lady russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman 
it was very desirable that the complexion should be renewed if it could be done without any compromise of propriety on the side of the ballots 
sir walters however would choose his own means and at last wrote a very one letter of ample ax laudations regret and entreaty to his right honourably e cousin 
neither lady russell nor mr enlist could admire the letter 
but it did all that was wanted in bringing three lines of scrawl from the danger countess 
she was very much honoured and should be happy in their acquaintance the toils of the business were over the sweets began 
they visited in layers place they had the cards of danger countess dalrymple and the honourable miss carters to be arranged wherever they might be most visible and a our cousins in layers place 
— a our cousins lady dalrymple and miss carter a were talked of to everybody 
10s amoy 
arre was ashamed 
had lady dairy leg and her daughter even been very agreeable the would kill have been ashamed of the agitation they created but they were nothing 
there was no superiority of manner 
accomplishment or demanding 
lady dairy less had acquired the name of a charming woman all the had a mile and a civil answer r everybody 
mice carter with will lean to lay wan to plain and lo awkward 
that the would never have been tolerated in camden place but for her birth 
lady russell confessed that till had expected something better 
but yet it was an acquaintance worth having 
and when anyone ventured to k her opinion of them to mr enlist he agreed to their being nothing in themselves but still maintained that at a family connection a good come any at there who would collect good can spy around them they had their value 
arre smiled andean 
a y idea of good company mr enlist it the company o clever well-informed people who have a great d of conversation 
that is what i call good corn nay 
a ou re mistaken d said he gently 2 that in not good company 
that ll the but 
good company requires on y mirth education and manners and with regard to education is not very nice 
birth and good manners are evening 
but a little learning it by no means a clean trout thing in good company 3 on the contrary it will do very well 
my cousin annie health her head 
she in not retired 
she in futidioru 
my dear cousin lilting down by her b you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman i know 
but will it answer 
will it make on happy 
will it not be wiser to accept the society o these sod ladies in layers place and enjoy all the advantages of the complexion a in an audible 
you may depend upon persuasion i 18 igthatdteywillmoveintheﬁrstoetin baths winter and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family our family let me any 
i in that degree of consideration which we must all me for eyes a sighed annie 2 we shall indeed be known to be related to them 
a then recollecting herself and not wishing to be answered she added a certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance 
i suppose smiling i have more pride than any of you 
but i confess it does vex me that we should be so delicious to have the relationship acknowledged which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them 
pardon me my dear cousin you are unjust to your own claims 
in london perhaps in your present quiet style of living it might be as ou sap 
but in bath sir walters elusion and his family will always be worth knowing always acceptable as acquaintance 
well a said annie 
i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon placed a i love your indignation d said he 
it is so natural 
but here you are in bath and the best is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walters enlist 
you ask of being proud 
i am called round i know end i shall not wish to believe myself otherwise 
for our pride if investigated would have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem a little different 
in one nest i am sure my dear cousin he continued speaking lower thou h there was no one else in the room 
in one point lam sure we must feel alike 
we must feel that every addition to your father society among his equals or superiors may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him l 4d persuasion 
he looked as he spoke to the neat which my clay had been lately occupying a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant 
and though anyone could not believe in their having the nine sort of pride the wan pleased with him for not liking man clay 
and her conscience admitted that hit wishing to provoke her father getting great acquaintance was more than inexcusable in the view of defending her 
chapter 1778 
hide sir water and elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good fortune in layers place annie wan renewing an acquaintance of a very different description 
she had called on her former governess and had heard from her of there being an old school-fellows in bath who had the two strong claim on her attention of past kindness and present suffering 
miss milton now my smith had shown her kindness in one of those period 
of her life when it had been root valuable 
anyone had gone unhappy to school grieving for the lost of a mother horrid the had dearly loved feeling her separation from home and suffering to a girl of fourteen of strong sensibility and not high spirits must suffer at such a time 
and liable milton three your older than herself but still from the want of near relation 
and a rattled home remaining another year at school had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerable lacquered her misery and could never be remembered with indifference 
miss milton had left school had married not long afterwards we laid to have married a man of fortune and this was all that anyone had known of her till now reason 
r s s that their governesses account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form 
she was a widow and poor 
her husband had been extravagant 
and at his death about two year 
before had left his affairs dreadfully involved 
she had had difficulties of every sort to contend with and in addition to these diseases had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever which finally settling in her legs had made her for the present a cripple 
she had come to bath on that account and was now in lodgings s near the hot baths living in a very humble way nah e even to record herself the comfort of a servant and of course almost excluded from society 
their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from miss enlist would give mrs smith and annoy therefore lost no time in doing 
she mentioned nothing of what she had he or what she in 
tended at home 
it would excite no ropers interest there 
she only consulted lady russell who entered through into her sentiments and was most ha to convict her as near to mrs smiths lodgings in estate buildings as anyone chose to be taken 
the visit was paid their acquaintance re-eslnblishcd their interest in each other more than rekindled 
the first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion 
twelve years were gone since they had parted and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had 16a ned 
twelve years had changed anyone from the booming silent unformed girl of fifteen to the elm ant little woman of seven-and-twenty with every aunty excepting bloom and with manners as conspicuously right as they were invariably gentle 
and twelve years had transformed the on-looking well 
grown miss walton in all the glow of health and conscience of superiority into a poor infirm helpless widow receiving the visit of her l r 16a pensunsrou 
fonder protested up a favour but all that won uncomfortable in the meeting had noon passed away 
and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking our old times annie found in mrs smith the good acme and agree 
able manner 
which the had almost ventured to d on and a disposition to conveyance and be cheerful beyond her expectation 
neither the dissipation of the put 
and the load lived very much in the world 
nor the reatrictiom of the present neither aicltneu nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits 
in the course of n second visit she talked with great opened and manners astonishment increased 
she could scarcely imagine a more cheering situation in itself than mrs smiths 
she had been ve fond of her husband the had hurled him 
she had n need to silence it wan gone 
she had no child to connect her with life and happen again no relation to assist in the arrangement of pen vexed affairs no health to make all the rent support les 
her accommodations were limited to a rosy parlour and a dark bedroom behind with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance which there we only one tenant in the house to afford and ill 
never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath 
yet in spite of all this anyone had canon to believe that the had moment only of languor and depressions to hours of occupation and enjoyment 
how could it be 
she watched observed reflected and small determined that this was not a case of fortitude or o resignation only 
a submissive spirit might be silent 
a strong understanding would apply resolution t here wan something more 
hen wan that relativity of mind that din ton to be comforted that wer of turning reading 3 
evil to good and of an nag persuasion 
i s 7 payment which carried her out of herself 
which was mum nature alone 
it was the choicest is of heaven 
and annoy viewed her friend me one o those instances in which by a merciful appointment it seems designed to counterbalance almost eve other want 
there had been a time is smith told her when her spirits had nearly failed 
she could not call herself an invalid now compared with her state on first reaching bath 
then she had indeed been a pitiable object 
for the had caught cold on the journey and had hardly taken possession of her lodging before the was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain 
and all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse and nausea at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense 
she had weathered it however and could truly say that it had done her good 
it had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands 
she had seen too much of the world to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve and would not use her ill 
and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse up a sister of her landlady a nurse by profession and who had always a home in that house when unemployed chanced to be at liberty in time to attend her 
and she d said mrs smith besides nursing me most admirably hat really roved an invaluable acquaintance 
as soon as i co d use my hands she taught me to limit which has been a great amusement 
and she put me in the way of making these little threadbare pin-cushions and barracks which you always and me so way about and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in thin neighbourhood 
she has a large acquaintance of course professionally among those who r 18 
manor 
can afford to buy and be dispose of m merchandise 
she always take the right time for apt eying 
everybody heart it open you know when they have recently escaped from severe pain or are recovering the bleating of health and nursed rooks thoroughly understand when to speak 
she in a shroud intelligent sensible woman 
here ii a line for acting human nature 
and ah ha 
a fund of good sense and starvation which at a companion make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received she but education in the world l know nothing worth attending to

to me who live to much alone her conversation i mute you is a traitor annie far from wishing to coil at the pleasure replied i am easily believe it 
women of that clue have great oop rotundities and if they are intelligent may be well we listening to 
such varieties of human nature a they are in the habit of wuthering 
and it is not merely in in follies that they are well read 
for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting 
what instances must pause before them of ardent disinterested self-denying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation 
of all the conflict and all the sacrifice that noble ut most 
a lick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes a year mid man smith more doubtingly sometimes it ma though i fear in lesson are not often in the clean style you describe

and un lately a skin low an m on there are so man w forget to think seriously tillie is almost too late annie saw the misery of such feelings 
the husband had not been what he ought and the wife had been led among that raft of mankind which made her think worse 
of the world than she hoped it deserved 
it was but 4 bang emotion however with mrs smith 
she shook it off and soon added in i different tone i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rocket is in at present will furnish much either to interest or me 
she is only nursing mrs willie of marlborough buildings 
a mere pretty silly expensive fashionable woman i believe 
and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and livery 
i mean to make my profits of mrs walls however 
she has plenty of man and i intend she shall buy all the high-pitched things have in hand now anyone had called several dregs on her friend before the existence of such a person was known in camden place 
at last it became necessary to speak of her 
sir walters elizabeth and mrs glassy resumed one morning from aura place with a sudden invitation from lady dairy les for the same evening and annoy was already engaged to spend that evening in estate buildings 
she was not sorry for the excuse 
they were only asked the was sure because lady dalrymple being kept at home by n bad cold was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her 
and she declined on her own account with great alacrity 
she was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow

merely who had been present while all thin planned now thought it advisable to leave the room and anyone could have said much and did long to lay a little in defence of bar friends not very dissimilar claim to theirs but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her

she left it to himself to recollect that my smith was not the only widow in bath between thirty and forty with little to live on and no name of dignity 
arre kept her appointment the others kept theirs and of course the heard the next morning that thatch had a delightful evening 
she had been the only one of the let absently for sir water and elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship service themselves but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others and had been at the trouble of insisting both lady swell and mr enlist 
and mr enlist ha made a point of leaving colonel wnlliearly and lady russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagement in order to wait on her 
anyone had the whole history of all that such an evening could apply from lady ruse

i am no match-maker at you well know laid lady russell being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human event and calculations 
i only mean that if mr enlist should some time hence pay his nddreuee to you and if you should be to accept him i think there would be every possibility of your being happy together 
a most nimble connection everybody mun consider it but 4 think it might be a very ha once a mr enlist in an exceedingly agreeable ran and in many respect i think highly of him aid annie 
a but we should not wit 
lady russell let thin pan and only said in rejoinder his own that to be able to regard you an the future mien of lynch the future lady flit to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother place 
proceeding to all her right and all her jocularity as well up to all her virtues would be the highest possible gratification to me 
you are your mother persuasion

and if i might y be allowed to fancy you em as she was in situation and name and home 
presiding and blessing in the same and only superior to her in being more highly valued 
my dearest annie it would give me more dell hat than is often felt at my time of life one was-obliged to turn away to rise to walk to s 
distant table and leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue the feelings this picture excited 
for a few moments her imagination an her heart were bewitched 
the idea of becoming what her mother had been 
of having the precious name of a lady enlist crest revived in herself 
of being restored to lynch calling it her home again her home for ever was a charm which she could not immediately resist 
lady russell said not another word willing to leave the matter to its own operation 
and believing that could mr enlist at that moment with propriety have s stern for himself l 
she believed in short what annie d not believe 
the same image of mr enlist speak in for himself brought annas to composure a 
the charm of lynch and of a lady enlist all faded away 
she never could accent him 
and it was not only that her feelings were still averse to any man save one 
her judgment on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against mr enlist 
though they had now been an missed a month she could not be satisfied that she read y knew his character 
that he was i sensible man an agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle this was all clear enough 
he certainly knew what was right nor could she ax on any one article of moral duty evidently transgress but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct 
she distanced the past if not 16a persuasion

and though he might now think very differently who could answer for the true sentiments of i clever cautious man grown old enough to appreciate a fair cluster 
how could it ever he aacemined that his mind vii truly cleaned mr enlist wall rational discreet polished but he want not open 
there was never any hum of feeling an warmth of indignation or delight at the evil or good of others 
this to anyone was a decided perfection 
her early impressions were incurable 
she seized the frank the departed the eager character beyond all other 
truth and enthusiasm did captivate her still 
she felt that the could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or aid a careless 
or a hasty thing than of those whose proof mind never varied whose tongue never i mr enlist was too generally agreeable

it may not be felt in bath with your nice pavement

i have not had a creature call on me time the second week in january except charles hatter who he

it would have kept her a little out of his way 
the carriage in gone to-day to bring louder and the saville to-morrow 
we are not asked to dine with them however till the day after my grove in no afraid of her being fatigued by the journey 
which ll not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her 
and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow

it woe almost too wonderful for belief and it was with the greatest effort that the could remain in the room preserve amir of calmness and newer the common question of the moment 
ha ily for her they were not many

if we were not related it would not ratify 
but a quite the would feel scrupulous an to any proposal of ours 
we had better leave the cross to and their own level 
there are several good-looking men walking about here who i am told are sailors 
the craft will associate with them 
thin wan sir water and elizabeth share of i 4 o persuasion 
interest in the letter 
when my clay had her tribute of more decent attention in an inquiry after charles grave and her one little boys annie war it liberty 
in her own room the tried to come reached it 
well miss hat charles wonder how captain arnsworth would fee i perhaps he had quieted the field had louisa up had sealed to love had found he did not love her 
she could not endure the idea of treachery or levity or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend 
she could not endure that ouch a friendship on their should be severed unfairly 
captain betwixt and love reprove 
the high-epirited joyoue-tallting louisa mongoose and the detected thinking feeling reading captain benvill 
seemed each of then everything that would not suit the other 
their minds most dissimilar 
where could have been the attraction 
the answer noon presented itself 
it had been in imitation 
they had been thrown together several week 
they had been living in the lame small family party since henrietta’n coming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each other and leaning just recovering from illness had been in an interesting late 
and captain'benwick wan not ineonuolnble 
that was a point which anyone had not been able to avoid suspecting before 
and ism of drawing the same conclusion as mary from the resent course of events they serves only to confirm the idea of his having felt some drawing of tenderness toward herself 
she did not mean however to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity than mary might have allowed 
she was persuaded that any tolerant genuine young woman who had listened and seemed to eel for him would have received the lame compliment 
he had an affectionate heart he must love somebody 
persuasion 
i 7 i she aw no reason against their being by 
love headlines naval fervour to begin with an they would soon grow more alike 
he would gain cheerfirlneae and the would learn to he an enthusiast for scott and lord byronic 
nay that wan probably learnt already 
of course they had fallen in love over poetry 
the idea of soils grove turned into a pen of literary taste and sentimentally reflection war amusing 
but the had no doubt of in being no 
the day at ye the fall from the cobb might indolence her health her newer her courage her character to the end of her life thoroughly an it appeared to have induced her fate 
the conclusion of the whole wan that if the woman who had been sensible of captain wentworth’e merits could be allowed to prefer another roar there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder 
and if captain wandsworth lost no friend hit certainly nothing to he regretted 
no it was not regret which made angel heart beat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheeks when the thought of captain wandsworth unshackled and free 
she had some feeling 
which she was ashamed to investigate 
they were too much like joy enables joy 
she longed to lee the cross 
but when the meeting took place it was evident that no manor of the new had yet reached them 
the visit of ceremony wan paid and returned 
and louisa grove war mentioned 
and captain beck too without even half a mile 
the cross had placed themselves in lodgings in gay streetlperfeetly to sir walters satisfaction 
he wan not at l ashamed of the acquaintance and did in fact think and talk a great deal more about the animal than the animal ever thought or talked about him 
the craft 
knew quite ii many people in bath at m 
2 persuasion 
they wished for 
and considered their intercourse with the enlist at a mere matter of form and not in the last likely to afford them any pleasure 
they brought with them their coom habit of being always together 
he wondered to w to keep off the gout in my craft teemed to go that with him in everything and to walk for her life to do him good 
arre aw them wherever the went 
lady russell took her out in her carriage marlott every morning 
and the never failed to think of them and never failed to testament

she always watched them a long it the could

at won as they were fairly ascending belongs he began 
— a well now you shall hear something that will praise you 
but list of all you mun tell me the name of the young lady i am going to tall about 
that young lady you know that we have all been to concerned for 
the mist mil-grove that all thin ha been happening to 
her christian name i always forget her christian name anyone had been ashamed to appear to come ached to loan ii the really did 
but now the could a sly suggests the name of a longing 
ay ay mialouiu grove that it the name 
which 
i i rich young ladies had not ouch i number of line christian names 
i should never be out if they were all sophy or something of that sort 
well this mind louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederick 
he war courting her week after week 
the only wonder on what they could be waiting for till thebusineaaat became 
then indeed it was clear enough that they must wait 
till her brain west to right 
but even then there war something odd in their way of going on 
instead of staying at same he went off to glamour and then he went off to see edward 
when we came back from forehead he was gone down to edward and there he has been ever since 
we have seen nothing of him since november 
em sophy could not under it 
but now the matter hug taken the man a turn of all 
for this young lady thin lame mill grove instead of being to marry frederick ll to marry james brick 
you know james brick 2 
a little 
i am a little acquainted with certain benwick.” well she in to my him 
nay most likely they are married already for i do not know what they should wait for c. b c i thought in crick a leaving no man said damper and i undenta'nedydfat he 25 excellent character 
oh 
yes yes there ll not a word to he said again james brick 
he in only a command it ll true made last summer and these are bad time for getting on but he has not another fault that i know of 
an excellent good-hearted fellow i assure you 
a very active zealous faces too which in more than you would think for perhaps 
for that united sort of manner 2 does not do him junior 2 indeed you are mistaken there air 
i should never 226 resume 
august want of spirit from captain beuwick't manners 
i thought them particularly and i will answer for it 
they would generally pleue.’ a well well ladies are the heat judges 
hut james beck in there piano for me 
and though very likely it in all our partiality sophy and i can not help thinking frederick s manner better than his 
there in something about frederick more to our rue annie wascaught.‘ she had only meant to suppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleman being incomparable with each other not at all to represent captain benwick’t manner a the very bees that could pony he 
and after a little habitation the vital beginning to us a i wan not entering into any comparison of the two friend 
a but the arrival interrupted her with 
caused the thing it certainly true 
it in not a mere bits gossip 
we have it from frederick himself 
hit litter had a letter from him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it in a letter from saville written upon the spot from uppercrou 
i flee they are ill at uppercroea 
hit wan an opportunity which anyone could not resist 
the mid therefore i hope admit i there it nothing in the it leg of captain wentworth’t letter to make you and re craft particularly uneasy 
it did certainly seems last autumn if there were an attachment between him and love motive 
but i hope it may he understood to have worn out on each tide equally and without violence 
i hope hall letter doe 
not breathe the spirit of an inflamed man 
not at all not at all there in not an oath or a murmur from beginning to and annoy looked down to hide her smile 
no no 
frederick is not a man to whine and complain 
he hat too much spirit for that 
if the girl numerous 
421 awry nun ham it in very it ugh should have a certainly 
but what i mean in that i hope there in nothing in wentworth’l manner of writing to make you suppose he think himself inflamed by his friend which might appear a know without it being absolutely lid 
i should very carry the inch a friendship ii he 
inherited between him and caring nick would be destroyed or even wounded y a clrcnmnance of thin sort 
eyes a i understand yon 
but there ll nothing at all of nature in the letter 
he does not give the lent sings at brick 
dozens in much lay a i wonder at it 
i have a mean of my own for wondering at it no you would not guns from his way of writing that he had ever thought of this mind what 3 her name 
for himself 
he very handsomely hopes th will be happy together 
and there ll nothing very un raving in that i think annie d not receive the perfect conviction which the animal meant to convey but it would have been useless to pity the inquiry farther 
she therefore satiated heel with commonplace remarks or quiet attention and the animal had it all hit own way 
poor frederick laid he at an 
now he must begin all over a air with somebody else 
i think we must get him to th 
sophy must write and beg him ten come to bath 
here are pretty girls enough amuse

hide admirably raft was taking that wall with ann and expecting hit with of getting ca n wandsworth to bath captain wandsworth was ready on hit way thither 
before mrs raft had written he war arrived and the very next time annie walked out 
the law him 
mr enlist war attending hit two cousins and my clay 
they were in milton street 
it began to rain not much but enough to master shelter delicate for women and quite enough to make it very desirable for mrs flit to have the advantage of being conveyed home in lady dalrymple’e carriage which war been waiting at a little distance the ann and my clay therefore turned into holland while mr flit to lady dahymplc w requested her ordnance 
soon joined them again nieces-fill of course 
lady dalrymple would be most happy take them home and would call for them in a few minute 
her ladyship carriage was a branches and did not hold more finn four with any comfort 
main arteries wet with her mother 
consequently it war not remarkable to expect accommodation for all the three camden place ladies 
there could be no doubt at to mine enlist 
whoever suffered inconvenience the nuts wife none but it occupied a little time to nettle the point of civility between the other two 
the rain er a mere tribe and annoy was most dancers in preserving a walk with mr enlist 
but the rain was also a mere trifle to my clay 
the would hardly allow it even to drop at all and her boots were so thick 
much thicker than miss annals 
and in about her civility rendered her quite at anxious to be left to walk with mr split a anyone could he and it we discussed between them unsunsron 
a 421 with a generosity so polite and so determined that the others were obliged to settle it for them 
miss enlist maintaining that mrs clay had a little cold spread and mr enlist deciding on a that hit cousin nets boots were rather the thief it was fixed accordingly that mrs clay 
should he of the party in the carriage 
and they had just reached this not when anyone as she eat near the window descended most decidedly and distinctly captain wentwotth walking down the street 
her start was perceptible only to herself 
but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world the most unaccountable and absurd 
for a few minute 
she saw nothing before her it was all confusion 
she was lost and when the had scolded back her senses she found the others still waiting for the carriage and mr enlist always obliging 
just setting off for union sheet on n commission of mrs clay s 
she now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door 
she wanted to see if it rained 
why was the to suspect herself of another motive 
captain wandsworth mun be out of sight 
she left her seat she would go 
one half of her should not he always to much wiser than the other half or always msgecn‘ng the other of being worse than it was 
she wool see if it rained 
she was sent back however in a moment by the entrance of captain wandsworth himself among s party of gentlemen and ladies evidently his acquaintance and whom he must have joined a little below wilson street 
he was more obviously struck and confused by the right of her than she had ever observed before 
he looked quite red 
for the first time since their renewed acquaintance she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two 
she had the advantage of him in preparation of the insect few moments 
all 18 persuasion 
the overpowering blinding bewildering ne effect of rag surprise were over with her 
till however she had enough to fell it vamp agitation pin pleasure 
a nothing between delight and missy 
he spoke to her end then turned awe 
the character of hit manner wan ernhnmument 
he could not love called it either cold or friendly or anything no certainly an unlimited 
after i hurt interval however he came toward her and spoke again 
manual inquiries on common inhneitherofthemmmhnhly much their for w t they heard and annoy continuing fully simile of his being lea at one than formerly 
they had dint 
of being in very much member got tap speak to eat other with a considerable man ofawanntindiﬁ'erenoe and calmly 
but he co d not do it now 
time had changed him or long had changed him 
there wan conlcinulnen of tome forty or other 
he looked very well not an if he had been ushering in health or pink and he talked of uppercrole of the mulgrovee nay even of losing and had even a momentary look of his own arch iigniﬁcanee n he named her 
but

it war just occupation enough the had feeling for the tender spirits for the gay attention for the scientific and patience for the wearisomest 
and had never liked a concert better at least during the list act 
towards cone of it in the interval succeeding an italian song she explained the words the song to mr enlist 
they had a concert bill between them 
this a laid the e in nearly the sense or rather the running of the worth for certainly the tense of an italian evensong must not he talked of but it it no nearly the means an i can give 
for i do not pretend to understand theiangunge 
i am a very poor italian scholar 
yet yes i see you are 
i ace you know nothing of the matter 
you have only knowledge enough of the language to branches at night these inverted turtlcunailed italian finger into clear comprehends elegant english 
you need not y anything more of your ignorance 
here is complete proof

d i will not of ouch kind politeness 
but i should be sorry to examined by a real proficient 
i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden places long a replied he d without knowing something of mine annie enlist 
and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware 2 of half her accomplishment and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman 2 for shame 
for shame thin to too much of mastery 
i forget what we are to have next turning to the bill 
perhaps said mr enlist 
speaking low i have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of a indeed how so 
you can have been acquainted with it only since i came to bath excepting an s might he 
me previous spoken of in my own fat y 
i knew you by report long before you came to bath 
i had heard you described by those who knew you intimately 
i have been acquainted with you by character many years 
your person your disposition accomplishment manner 
they were all described they were all present to me 
mr enlist was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise 
no one can withstand the charm of such a mystery 
to have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance by nameless plate in irresistible 
and annoy wan all curiosity 
her wondered and questioned him eagerly 
but in vain 
he delighted in being asked but he would not tell 
d no no some time or other perhaps but not now 
he would mention no names now 
but such he could assured her had been the fact 
he had many years ago received inch 31 description of miss annie enlist as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excited the warmest curiosity to know her 
nesrmsron 
149 anyone could think of no one so likely to have kept with parting of her many year a o as the mr unworthy of oxford captain entworth’s brother 
he might have been in mr enlist s company but he had not courage to all the union 
2 the name of anyone enlist sid he has long had an interesting sound to me 
very long has it presented a charm over my fancy 
and if i dared i would breathe my wishes that the name might never change such she believed were his words 
but scarcely had she received their sounds than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her which rendered everything else trivial

it had that appearance 
it seemed as if she had been one moment too late 
and as long as she dared observe he did not look again but the performance wan recommencing and the vicar forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward

to anyone it chiefly wore the prospect of an r of agitation 
she could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wandsworth once more without the interchange of one friendly look 
in regretting themselves there were now many changes the result of which was favourable for her 
colonel walls declined setting down a n and mr enlist woe invited by elizabeth and main street in a manner not to be refuted to lit between them 
and by name other removal and a little scheming of her own annie was enabled to place himself much mar the end of the bench than the had been before much more within reach of a passer-by

i haven a little premature i received 
i beg your pardon 
i ought to have waited or official information 
but now my dear mill enlist an an old friend do give me a hint or to when i may speak 
next week 
to be rule by next week 4 may he allowed to think it all unsettled and build my own hellish scheme on mr elliot'l good fortune into a replied annie nor next week nor next nor next 
i assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled an week 
i am not going to marry mr enlist 
i to d like to know why you imagine i am 2nd my smith looked at her again looked eagerly united shook her head and exclaimed 
a now how i do wish i understood on 
how i do with i knew what a were us have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel when the right moment cornelia 
till it doe come you know we women never mean to have anybody 
it is a thing of courses among us that every man in refund till he ordered 
but why should you he cnlel.’ let me plead for my 
prudent friend i can not call him but for my former friend 
where can you look for a more suitable match 
where could you expect a more gentlepersuasion 
30 i unlike agreeable nun 
let me recommend mr enlist 
i am sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel walls 
and who can know him better than colonel walls 
my dear mr smith mr elliot’s wife has not been dead much above half a ear 
he ought not to be sup proposed to be paying his addresses to on one 
half if these are your only objections cried mr 
smith archly 2 mr enlist is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him 
do not forget me when you are married that s all 
let him know me to be a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required which it is very natural for him now with many affair and engagements of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can 
very natural perhaps 
ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same 
of course he not be aware of the importance to me 
well my dear miss enlist i hope and trust you will be very happy 
mr enlist has sense to understand the value of such a woman 
your peace will not be uhinvreckcd as mine has been 
you are safe in all wo duly matters and safe in his character 
he will not be led stray 
he will not be misled by others to his ruin a 
no d said annie d i can readily believe all that of my cousin 
he seems have a calm decided temper not at all open to dangerous impressions 
i consider him with great respect 
i have no reason from anything that ha 
fallen within my observation to do otherwise 
but i have not known him long 3 and he is not i man s i think to be known intimate soon 
will not this manner of speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me 
surely this must be calm enough 
and upon my word he is nothing to me 
should he ever propose to me which i have we little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing

mrs mr enlist had not the chin which you have been run pot 
in whatever pleasure the concert fluty night wig t all not mr elicit

that the had implied in much 
but luwou‘ldqlnrdly have been incident 
my smith would hardly lave believed to noon in mr elliot’l failure but from the perception of there being a somebody else 
as it was she amply submitted 
and with i the semblance of seeing nothing beyond 
and annoy eager to escape farther notice wan impatient to know wh man smith should have fancied the was to marry r enlist 
where the could have received the idea or from whom he could have hard it 
do tell how it came into ur head 
b c it link came into my had a reply led my smith 
upon ending how much were together and feeling it to be the most pmbabremthing in the world to he wished for by everybody belonging to either of you 
and you may defend upon it that all your acquaintance lave dispose of you in the me way 
but i never heard it spoken of till two day ago 
and hot it indeed been spoken of 
d a did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when on called lu a no 
an not it n bred a small or the maid 
l observed no one in panic are a it wan my friend my rocket 
sure rooks 
who by-the-bye had a great curiosity no see on and war de agreed to be in the way to let on in 
he came away from marlborough building on yon sunday 
and she it wan who told me you were to marry mr enlist 
she had had it from my walks herself which did not seem had authority 
she not an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole history 
mansion 
249 the whole theory l related annie laughing 
“shecouldnotrnnke i very on 
history i one such little article of unbounded new man smith aid nothing 
but a continued annie present although there iver truth in my having thin claim on mr enlist i lhouldbeextmmelyhn webs outlet you in any we that i could 
s i mention to him your being a in this shall i uneasy mange 
no i thank you no certainly not 
in the warmth of the moment and under a milker impression i might 
perhaps have endeavoured to intend you in some drcumeuncels but not now 
no i thank you i have nothing to trouble you with 
i think you spoke of having known mr enlist many gum p i d i did 
not before married i mus poses 
b c yet 
he was not married w i knew him listen a and 
were you much acquainted i 
a intimately indeed 
then do tell me whit he was at that time of life 
i have a great curiosity to know what mrelliotwu an every young man 
was he at ill inch 31 he year now 
a d i have not seen mr enlist these three yeah c was an smiths never given so gravely that it was impossible to nave the subject farther 
and annoy felt that the gained nothing but an increase of curiosity 
they were both silent if smith very thoughtful 
at 12s 
d i beg your pardon m dear mine enlist she cried in her natural tone of co reality d i beg your pardon for the short answer 
i have been given you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do 
i have been doubting and wondering i to what i ought to tell yon 
n 250 summon 
there were many things be taken into the account 
one hates to he opinion to be giving had in a no making mischief 
even the smooth surface of family 
union seem worth preserving though there may nothing arable heath 
however i have determined 
think i am right 
i think you ought to be rude as satiated with mr elliot’s tell character 
though fully believe that at pmmyyou lure norther smallest intention of accepting him there in no tying v what may hit 
you might lame time or other be differently n acted towards him 
hear the truth therefore now while you are prejudiced 
mr enlist in a man without hurt or conscience 
i. designing wiry cold-blooded being 
who think 
only of htmaell‘ 
who for his own interest or use would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery slut could he perpetrated without risk of hi 
general character 
he ha no feeling for other 
those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin 
he ran neglect and desert without the smallest compunction 
he in totally beyond the reach of my sentiments of justice or companion 
oh 
he ll block it hurt 
hollow and black 
angel astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pale and in i calmer manner he added a my cxpreuionl started you 
you mun allow for an injured angry woman 
but i will to command myself 
i will not amuse him 
i will only tell you what i have found him 
futilely speak 
he won the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him at good ii himself 
the intimacy had been formed before our marriage 
i mud t em most intimate friends 
and i too became executioner pleased with mr elusion and entertained the high opinion of him 
at nineteen on know one the 
not think ve seriously 
but mr slit n to toe quite ii at others 
and much more agreeable a l persuasion 
249 than most others 
and we were almost always either 
we were principally in town 
living in very style 
he war then the inferior in drcummacea 
he war then the poor one 
he had chamber in the temple and it was a match 
he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman 
he had always a home with us whenever he chose it 
he was always welcome 
he war like a brother 
my poor charles who had the nest root l spirit in the world would have divided hides but farthing with him 
i know that his pnnewalopento him 
i know that he often united him a thin must have been about that very rod of mr elliot'a life laid annie which has ways excited my particular curiosity 
it must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and time 
i never knew him myself i only heard of him 
but there war a something in hell conduct then with regard to my father and peter and afterwards in the circumeuncel of sill mania e which i never could quite reconcile with present mr 
it seemed to announce a different sort of man 
i know it all i know it all a cried mr smith 
a he had been introduced to sir water and your defer before i was acquainted with him but i heard him speak of them for ever 
2 know he war invited and encountered and i know he did not choose to go 
i can satisfy you chapels on points which you would little expect 
an as to hit marriage i knew all about it at the time 
i w pray to all the on and again 
i was the friend to whom he conned his hopes and plane 
and though i did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards or at lent till within the last two years of her life and can lower an question you with to put nay a said annie d i have particular inquiry c 10s persuasion 
to make about her 
i have always understood were not i happy couple 
but i should like to know why at tint time of his life he should slight my father's acquaintance as he did 
my father certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him 
why did mr enlist draw back i d mr split a man smith 
at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by i rather quicker procethan the law 
he woe determined to make it by marriage 
he we 
determined at lent not to mar it by an impatient marriage 
and i know it was hi belief whether jury or not of course i can not decide that your father and cider in their civilities and invitation were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that ouch a match should have answered 
hi idea of wealth and indqlcndencc 
that wan his motive for drawing back i can name you 
he told me the whole story 
he had no concealment 
with me 
it was curious that having upset left you behind me in bath my first and prancing acquaintance on worrying should be your cousin 
and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister 
he described one minus elusion and i thought my affectionately of the 
other 
perhaps a cried annie muck b a sudden idea you sometimes spoke of me to mr slit 
so sure i did 
very often 
i uncle to boat of my own annie elusion and vouching for your being a very different creature from 
d she checked herself in time 
this accounts for something which mr enlist said last night cried annie 
this explains it 
i found he had been mad to hear of me 
i could not come reread how 
what wild inn stations one farm w ere a dear self is concerned 
ow cure to be mistaken 
hang 
10th bustle ourpordon 
i have interrupted you 
mr enlist united then completely for money 
the circle probably which first opened your eyes to hicharacteri’ man smith hesitated 3 little here 
oh 
those thing are too common 
when one liver in the world a man or woman annoying for money ll too common to strike one s it ought 
i wan very young and associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless y net without any strict ruler of conduct 
we lived or enjoy i think differently now 
time andiicknee and sorrow have given me other notions 
but at that i must own raw nothing reprehenlible in what mr enlist was doing 
to do the better himself passed at a duty 
a but was not the a re low woman 
a eyes 
which 4 object to but he would not rid 
money mastery wan all that he wanted 
her after me a brazier her grandfather hid been a butcher but that was all nothing 
she will a one woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliot'u company and fell in love with him 
and not a difficulty or a couple was there on his ride with respect to her birth 
all his caution was spent in being tenure of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself depend upon it whenever esteem mr enlist may have for hit own situation in life now 
up a young mus he had not the unallied value for it 
hi chance of the bell inch estate wan nothing but all the honour of the family he held at cheap 9 dirt 
i have often heard him declare that if baronctciea were miserable anybody should have hit for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included 
but i will not pretend to repeat halfthzt lunged hear him my on that subject 
it would not be fair 
and yet you ought to have proof for nor persuasion 
whet it all thin but tension and you shall have indeed my dear mr smith i want none cried annie 
you have reverted nothing oonmdicto to what mr enlist appeared to be tome year ago 
1.lzhia in all in confirmation rather of what we need to hear and believe 
i am more curious to know why he would be no different now 
but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary 
stay i am sir you will have the mill greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom 
and bringing me the mall inland box which you will and on the upper shelf of the closet annie eyeing her friend to be ready bent on it did an the wan desired 
the box we brought and placed before her and mr smith fighting over it up the unlocked it mid 
this in full of paperbelonging to him to my husband 
a wall portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him 
the letter i am looking for wan one written by mr flit to him before our marriage and happened to be lived 
why one can hardly imagine 
but he was careful and immethodicnl like other men about these things 
and when i came to examine his pit to i found it with other nil more trivial from dis erect plea scattered here and there while many longer an memorandum of real iron romance had been destroyed 
here it in 
i would not burn it became being even then very little utilized with mr enlist i was determined to pretend every document of former intimacy 
i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it 
thin wan the letter directed to chapel smith 
tunbridge wells c and dated from london at far k at july 1802 
rznsunsron

at present believe me i have no need of your services 
being in cash again 
give me joy i have got rid of sir water and mire 
they are gone back to lynch and almost made me wear to visit them thin summer 
but my great visit to lynch will be with a purveyor to tell me how to bring it with but advantage to the hammer 
the bayonets neverthdcaa ll not unlikely to marry again 
he in quite fool enough 
if he does 
however they will leave me in peace which may be a decent equivalent for the revelation

such a letter could not be read without putting annie in a glow 
and my smith observing the high colour in her face said

but it shows you the man

on monday evening my good friend my rocket let me that much into the accretion marlborough building 
when i talked of a whole history therefore you ice i war not remarking or much at you wppoaed.’ my dear mr smith

only have me a hearing 
you will noon be able judge o the general credit due by listening to come particular which you can yourself immediately contradict or concern 
nobody suppose that you were his list inclement 
he had seen you indeed before he arm to bath and admired you 
but without knowing it to be you 
so lay my human at lent

so far it ll very true

i happened to be at lame 
a well a continued mrs smith trim honestly 2 grant my friend the credit due to the employment of the list point asserted 
he aw you then at lame and liked you so well up to be exceedingly pleased to meet with us again in camden place as him annie elusion and ram that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visit there 
but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain 
if there in anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable into me 
my account camp that your limbs friend the lady now staying with you whom i has heard ou mention came to bath with miss elusion and in water so long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and ha 
been 2 l 2 pmasioii

that ill is a clever inalmllting handing woman

ere man smith paused a moment 
hutannehad not a word to say and the continued 
this wan the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it 
and colonel walls had his eye upon your father enough to be mild of it 
though he did not then visited in camden place 
but his regard for mr enlist gave him an interest in watching all that wan going on there and when mr enlist came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel walls nudged him acquainted with the appearance of things and the m beginning to prevail 
now you are to undermine tint time had worked a very material change in mr elliot’a opinion as to the value of a baronetcy 
upon all point of blood and confusion he in a completely altered man 
having long had an much man at he could tend nothing to with for on the de o avarice or indulgence he hat been gradually looming to pin he happened upon the consequence he in heir to 
i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it in now a confirmed feeling 
he can not beardxeideaofnotheing sir william 
you may guess therefore 
that the next he heard from his friend could not he very agreeable and you may guess what it produced 
the resolution of coming back to bath an won an possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the persuasion 
2 i 3 degree of his danger end of circumventing the lady if he found it material 
thin was a upon between the two friend 
an the only thing to done 
and colonel walls wan to unite in every way that he could 
he was to be introduced and my willie war to be introduced 
and everybody wan to be introduced 
mr enlist came back accordingly 
and on application was forgiven us now admitted into the family 
and there it was his constant object and hit only oléjectvyill your arrival added another motive 
to watch it alter and my clay 
he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way 
all at all hours 
but i need not be particular on thin subject you can imagine what an artful man would do 
and with thin e in perhaps my recollect what you have seen him a 
yet a laid annie b you tell me nothing which durst not accord with what i have known or could imagine 
there in always something offensive in the detail of cunning 
the manoeuvre of eelliahnen and duplicate must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprised me 
i know that who would be shocked by such a representations of mr enlist who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been ratified 
i have always wanted acme other motive for his conduct than appeared 
i should like to know his present opinion a to the probability of the event he hat been in dread of 
whether he consider the danger to be evening or not 
learning i understand replied my smith 
a he think my clay afraid of him aware that he see through her and not daring to proceed at the might do in his absence 
but since he mun he been some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while the hold her present influence

a it will be more painful to me in tome respects to be in company with him but shall know better what to do 
my line of conduct will be more direct 
mr enlist in evidently a ditingenuoun artificial world man who hat had never any better principle to go him than iclﬁnhneu.” but mr enlist want yet done with 
my smith had been carried away from her first direction and anyone had forgotten in the interest of her own family concern how much had been originally implied against him 
but her attention was now called to the explanation those list hits 
and ill listened to a recital which if it did not perfectly qualify the unqualified bitterness of my smith proved him to have been very unfeeling in hit conduct towards 
very deficient both in justice and companion 
she learned that the intimacy between them continuing impaired by mr enlist 4 marriage they had been a before always together and mr enlist had led hit friends into expenses much beyond his fortune 
my smith did not want to take blame to herself and we root elder of throwing any on her husband 
but annie rumour 
2 r s could collect that their income had never been elm to their style of living and that from the list there and been a great deal general and joint extravagance 
from his wife's account of him she could discern mr smith to have been a man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong understanding 
much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him led by him and probably despised him 
mr enlist 
raised his marriage to great fence and to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without 
involving himself for without his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man and beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend probableﬁnances but on the contrary had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the smiths accordingly had been missed 
the husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it 
hey had previously known embarrassment enough to try the friendship of their friends and to prove that mr enlist s had better not be tried 
but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known 
with a conscience in mr elliot’s regard more creditable to his feelings than his judgment mr smith had appointed him the executor of his will 
but mr enlist would not act and the difficulties and distressed which thin refusal had heaped on her in addition to the inevitable mutterings of her situation had been such a could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened to without corresponding indignation 
arre was shown some letters of his on the occasion answers to urgent application from mrs smith which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and under a cold civility the name

and thin proper though not large would be enough to rule her lively rich

she had no in connection to ruin her even with their counsel and could not afford ts chua the nuisance of the law 
thin was a cruel aggravation of actually straightened men 
to feel that the ought to be in baker circumstance that a little trouble in the right place might do it and to fear that delay might be even viewing her claims war hand to bear 
it war on this point that the had hoped to engage annual good nicely with mr enlist 
she had previously in the anticipation of their marriage been very ve of long her friend by it 
but on being mutedthathecouldhavemadenomemptofthat nature since he did not even know her to he in bath rnsussron 
421 4 it immediately occurred that something might be done in her favoured by the influence of the woman he loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest annals feelings as far as the observances due to mr elliot’s character would allow when annals reputation of the sun engagement changed the face of everything 
i while it took from her the new-found he of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left er at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way 
after listening to this full description of mr enlist anyone could not but express some surprise at mrs smiths having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation 
d she had seemed to recommend and praise him i a cry dear c was mrs smiths reply there was nothing else to be done 
i considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet have made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him 
than if he had been your husband 
my heart bled for you as i talked of happiness 
and yet he is sensible he is agreeable and with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless 
he was very unkind to his first wife 
hey were wretched together 
but she was too mount and guide for respect and he had never love her 
i was willing to hope that you must re better 
v anyone could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed 
it was just possible that she might have been persuaded by lady russell 
and under such a sum upon which would have been most miserable in en time had disclosed all too late 
it was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived 
and one of the concluding arranged passion 
area of thin important conference which carried them through the greater p of the morning vale that anyone had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relatives to my smith in which hit conduct vials involved 
a chart 
421 one went home to think over all that the had heard 
in ones her feeling were relieved by this know get of mr enlist 
there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him 
he stood opposed to captain wanton in all hit own unwelcome obtrnl'veneu 
and the evil of his attention an night the immediate mischief he might hove done wan coincided with mention un unhinged perplexed 
pity for him wag all over 
but 140 wan the only point of relief 
in every other respect in looking round her or penetrating forward the now more to dim and to apprehend 
she was concerned for the disappointment and lady russell would be feeling 
for the mortiﬁcntionl which mun be hanging over her father and lines and had all the silent of freeing many evil without knowing how to avert any one of them 
she was most than ill for her own knowledge of him 
she had never considered himself at entitled m mud for not lighting an old friend like mus smith but here war a reward indeed springing from it 
mrs smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done 
could the knowledge have been extended through her family 
but thin wan a vain idea she must talk to lady russell tell her consult eg 
her and having done her best wait the event with i. much composure at possible 
and after all her and want o composure would be in that quarter of passion

and at noon at it became clear that there their name relations were not arrived with any views of accommodation in that home sir water and elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality and do the honour of it very well 
they were come to bath for a few days with mr mongoose and we at the white hart 
so much wan pretty anon understood 
but till sir water and elizabeth were walking nasunsrou

he gave her a very plain intelligible account of the whole 4 a narration in which the law a great deal offshoot characteristic proceeding 
the scene had received in at impulse by captain harville'a wanting to come to bath on business 
he had begun to talk of it a week ago 
and by way of doing something a shooting wan over carlsbad prepared coming with him and my saville had seemed to like the idea of it very much up an advantage to her husband 
but mary could not bear to be left and had made herself i 
unhappy about it 
that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense or at an end 
but then it had been taken up by hi father and mother 
his mother had some old friend in bath whom the wanted to see 
it war thought a good rotundity for henrietta to come and buy wedding other for herself and her tillers 
and in short it ended in being lull mother's retty that everything might be comfortable and eat to paint saville 
and he and mary were clad in it by way of general convenience 
they had arrived late the night before 
my saville her children and captain brick remained with mr grove and louisa at us return 
ancient only surprise was that affair thou d be in forwarded enough for henrietta’e wedding-clothes to be talked of 
she had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as musty prevent the marriage from being near at hand

a particularly glad that thin should happen 
and that of two date who both deserve equal well and who have always been ouch good friends e plenary prospect of one should not he dimming those of the other 
that they should be no equal in their prosperity and comfort 
i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both oh yet

we had a famouiet-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my father rent harm 
and he played his part so well that i have liked him the better ever since here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charles following the other to admire marrow and as reumsxou

she had no demand on her father or litter and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawing-room 
elizabeth was for a short time uttering a good deal 
she felt that my mongoose and ill her party ought to he asked to dine with them 
but the could not bear to have the difference of eye the reaction of events which a dinner must betray withered by those who lulled been always is inferior to the enlist of lynch 
it war a struggle between propriety und vanity

we do not prefer to give dinners 
few people in bath do

and tin the last words brought is enquiringeyes from charles to herself 
charles and mary still talked on in the same style 
he half serious and hslfjesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she invariably serious anon wantonly opposing it and not admitting to make it known that however determined to go to camden place herself she should not think herself very well used if they went to the play without her

arre talked of being perfect ready and tried to look it 
but the felt that could entries have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair in preparing to quit the room the would have found in 84 her own notation for her cousin in the very security of his affection wherewith to pity her 
their prepantlone however were wrapped chart

after the water of a few minutes in laying the proper nothing the begin to give the invitation which was to comprised ill the remaining due of the mulgrovee

the truth was that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to under the importance of a man lean air and appearance ll hire 
the put was nothing 
the present agatha captain weutworth would move thou well in her drawing-room 
the card was pointedly given and sir water and elizabeth arm and disappeared 
the interruption had been short though severe and eve and animation returned to most of thee they left in the door that them out but not to anyone 
she could think only of the invitation the had with and punishment witnessed and of the manner in which it had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather than gratification of polite acknowledgment rather than acceptance 
she knew him the law again in bill 
eyes and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept inch an offering an an amusement for all the insolence of the past 
her spirits sank 
he held the card in hit hand after they were gone an if y considering it

whispered mary very dimly

you see he can not put the card out of hit hand 
arre caught his eye law his cheek

the party separated 
the gentlemen hid their own punish the ladle proceeded on their own lines and they met no more while annie belonged to them 
she wan comedy begged to return and dine and give them all the rent of the day but her pint had been so long exerted that at present the felt unequal to move and it only for home where he might be cure of being ii alert at she chose confusion

they were reckoning him an certain but with her it was a grain solicitude never appeared for eve minutes together 
he generally thought he would come because the generally thought he ought 
but it wan a case which the could not to shape into an positive act of duty or discretion an inevitably to d the suggestion of very appetite feeling 
she only routed herself from the breeding of thin readers agitation to let mrs clay know that the had been seen with mr enlist three hours after his being opposed to be out of bath for having watched in vain for name intimation of the interview from the lady herself the determined to mention it and it seemed to her that there was guilt in my clay face an the lichened

but anyone could imagine the read there the conecionaneal of hove in by borne completion of mutual trick or come overhearing authority of he been obliged to attend perhaps or half an hour to his features and rentrictiona on her designs on in water 
she exclaimed 
however with a very tolerable imitation of nature

enough passed between rim to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk where the wer of conversation would make the present hour a indeed and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow 
there they exchanged a in those feelings and droned promises which had once he re seemed to secure everything but which had been followed b so many many years of division and estrangement 
here they returned again into the past noisome exquisite hasp y perhaps in their union than when it had been rest rejected 
more tender more tried more mixed in 3 knowledge of each other's character truth and attachment more us to act more justified in acting 
and there as they only paced the gradual ascent heedless of every group around them seeing neither sauntering politicians hustling housekeepers flirting girls nor nurcery-mnids and children they could indulge in those retrospectionl and acknowledges and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the resent moment which were so poignant and so cases in interest 
all the little variations of the last weeks were gone through 
and of yesterday and to-day there could scarcely be an end 
she had not mistaken him 
jealousy of mr enlist had been the reading weight the doubt the torment 
that had begun to operate in the ve hour of first meeting bering bath 
that had return after a short suspension 
to ruin the concert 
and that had influence him in everything he had said and done 
or omitted to say and do in the last four-and-twenty hours 
it had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks 
or words or actions occasionally encouraged 
it 25 mum 
had been vanquished at last thoaeaemimeotaaod those tones which had mob him while the asked with captain saville 
and under the irresistible severance of which he and seized a sheet of paper and poured out his feelings 
of who 
he had then written nothing wan to be retraced or qualified 
he persisted in having loved none but her 
she had never been supplicated 
e never even believed himself to see her equal 
that much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge that he had been content unconsciously nay intentionally 
that he had meant forget her and believed it to be done 
he had imagined himself indifferent when he had only been angry 
and he had been just to her america because he had been a sweeter from them 
her character wan now fixed on his mind ii perfection itself maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness 
but he wan obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercroaa had he learnt to do her justice and only at ye had be begun to demand himself 
at l me he had received lemon of more than one sort 
he patting admiration of mr enlist had at least roused him and the ascent on the cobb and at the saville had fixed her superiority 
in preceding attempt to attach himself to social grove the attempt angry pride he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible 
that he had not cared could not care for louisa 
thou h till that day till the pleasure for reflection which foil owed it he had not understood the effect excellence of the mind with which louisa coop d in ill bear a comparison or the perfect unravelled hold it pondered over his own 
there he had learnt to distinguish between the modes of principle and the luminary of ill-will between the daring of heedleaaneu and the resolution of a collected mind 
there he had seen everything to persuasion 
25 l exalt in his intention the woman he had lost 
and therebegnntodenlorediepride the folly thernadneaa of resentment 
which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way 
from that period he had become severe 
he had no sooner arm the honor and remorse attending the list few days of louisa accident no sooner begun to feel harness alive again than he had be to feel himself though alive not at liberty 
i found a did he that i was considered by saville an engaged man that neither saville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment i wan rattled and mocked

thin ma be bad nobility to conclude with but i believe it to truth 
and if such parties succeed how should a captain wandsworth and an annie enlist with the advantage of maturity of mind eon-domes of right and one independent fortune between them fail of bearing down every opposition 
they might in fact 
have home down a great deal more than they met with for there wan little to distress them beyond the want of gracious and warmth

on the contrary when he law more of captain wandsworth whim repeatedly b daylight and him well he was very much much by hi
