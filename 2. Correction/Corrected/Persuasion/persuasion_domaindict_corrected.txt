in water elliott of kellynch hall s in somcraeuhirc was a man who for his own amusement never took up any book but the parentage 
there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a disordered one 
there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest parents 
there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt 
as he turned over the almost endless creation of the last century and there if every other leaf were powerless he could read his own history with an interest which never failed this was the page at which the favourite volume always opened

she had harboured or softened or concealed his failings and promoted his real rcspccuibility for seventeen years 
and though not the very happiest being in the world herself had found enough in her duties her friends and her children to attach her to life and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them 
three girls the two eldest sixteen and fourteen was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath an awful charge rather to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited silly father 
she had however one very intimate friend a sensible deserving woman who had been brought by many attachment to herself to settle close by her in the village of kellynch 
and on her kindness and advice lady elliott manly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instructions which she had been anxiously giving her daughters 
this friend and sir walker did not marry whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance 
thirteen years had passed away since lady elliott death and they were still near neighbours and minute friends and one remained a widower the other a widow 
that lady smell of steady age and character and extremely well provided for should have no thought of a second marriage needs no apology to the public which is rather apt to be unreasonably diuonmted when a woman do marry again than when she does not but sir walkers continuing in singlenesa requires explanation 
be it known then that sir water like a good father having met with one or two private dish persuasion 
a appointment in very unreasonable application himself on remaining single for his dear daughter take

elizabeth had succeeded at sixteen to all that will trouble of her mother right-hand consequence 
and being very handsome and very like himself her influence had always been great and they had gone on together coat happily 
two other children were of very inferior value 
mary had acquired a little artificial importance by becoming man charles misgive

her word had no weight her convenience wan always to give way 
the was only anne

lady unwell loved them all but it was only in anne that the could fancy the mother to revive again 
a few years before anne elliott had been a very pretty girl but her bloom had vanished early 
and as even in it height her father had found little to admire in her so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own 
there could be nothing in them now that she was faded and thin to excite his esteem 
he had never indulged much hope he had now none of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite word 
all equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth for mary had merely connected her with an old country family of respectability and large fortune and had therefore given all the honour and received none elizabeth would one day or other marry suitably

but soon after lady elliott death sir water had taught the acquaintance and though his degree had not been met with any warmth he had persevered in unlocking it making allowance for the model drawing-hack of youth 
and in one of their ring exertions to london when elizabeth was in her at bloom mr elliott had been forced into the introduction 
he was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the law 
and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable and every plan in his favour was confirmed 
he was invited to kellynch hall 
he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year 
but he never came 
the following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeable again encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come 
and the next tidings were that he won married

a since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate he had no temple he aid 1 in confusion his judgment to be entirely on that side 
it did not appear to him that sir walker could materially alter his style of living in a home which had such a character of hoepitnlitynnd ancient dignity to support 
in any other place sir waters might judge for himself 
and would he looked up to at relating the mode of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household 
sir wetter would quit kellynch hall 
and after a very few day more of doubt and indecision the great reception of whither he should go wan settled and the 22 outline of thin important change made out 
there had been three alternative london

or another house in the country 
all anne s weather had been farther linger 
a small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have lady uncle's society still he near army and still have the pleasure of persuasion 
3 sometimes seeing the him and drove kellynch was the object of her ambition 
but the natural fate of anne amended her in having something very of tea from her inclination fixed on 
she disliked the wind did not think it agreed with her 
and bath wan to be her home 
sir water had at lit thought more of london 
but mr s red felt that he could not he turned in london had been skilful enough to did him from it end make bath preferred 
it was a much after place for a gentleman in his predicament he might there be important at comparatively little expenses 
two material advantages of both over london had of course been given all their we hate inmate convenientdiuanee from kellynch only fifty miles and lady runell’l spending some part of every winter there 
and to the very great infection of lady quell whole line view-entire rejected change had been for bath 
sir water and elizabeth were induced to believe that they should knave neither consequence nor enjoyment by getting there 
lady cassel felt obliged to opposite her dear anne’known warm 
it would he too much to expect sir water to descend into a full home in hit own neighbourhood 
anne himself would have found 
the niortlﬁcationl of it more than the foresaw and to sir walkers feeling 
they must have been dreadful 
and with regard to angel dislike of bath he considered it up a prejudice and mistake minding hint from the circumstance of her having been three you at school there after her mother's death 
and secondly from her happening to he not in perfectly good spirit the only winter which ill

she wanted her to he more known

he was not only to quit his home but to ice it in the hand of then i trial of fortitude which longer head than sir water s have found too much 
kellynch hall wan to be let 
thin however was a pronounced secret not to be breathed beyond their own circle 
sir walker could not have borne the degradation of being known to delight letting his book

red pnsuasrou 
that 3 
a mistake leave to observe sir walker laid mr shepherd one morning at kellynch hall at he laid down the newspaper that the potent furniture in much in our favour 
thin peace will be turning all our rich naval officer ashore 
they will be all wanting a home 
could not be 1 better time sir water for having a choice of tenants very reasonable tenant many a noble fortune ha been made during the war 
if a rich admiral were to come in our way sir walker 
a he would be i very lucky man s hard a sir walker 
2 that if all i have to red or a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him 
rather the greatest pridefor all let him have taken ever to many before 
hey she heard 
mr shepherd laughed a he knew he fun at this and then added 
— a i prize to observe sir water that in the way of business gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with 
i have had a little knowledge of their method 
of doing business 
and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are an likely to make desirable tenant nun any let of people one should meet with 
therefore sir alter what i would take leave to get it that if in consequence of any rumour 
getting abroad of our intention 
which must be contemplated a a pitiable thing became we know how difficult it in to keep the action and delight of one part of the world from the notice and curiously of the other 
confidence has its tax 
i john shepherd might conceal any family-matter that i choose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me 
but sir walker elliott has eyes upon him which it may be very persuasion 
l 7 difficult to exclude 
and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some humour of the truth should get abroad 
in the w notion of which as i was going to observe since apple cautions will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to 
and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of reply g 
sir waiters on my nodded 
but soon afterwards rising and pacing the room he observed musical there are new among the gentlemen often have i imagine who would not be surprised to and these m in a house of this description 1 they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune a said my clay for mrs clay was present her father had driven her over nothing being of so much use to mrs clay health as a drive to kellynch but i quite agree with my father in thinking s taller might be a very desirable tenant 
i have known a good deal of the profession 3 and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways l these valuable pictures of yours sir water if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe 
everything in and about the house would be taken such excellence of l the gardens and shrubberies would he kept in almost as high order all they are now 
you need not be afraid miss elliott of put own sweet lower gardens being neglected 
all to all that rejoined sir walker coolly 1 supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it 
i am not particularly to favour a tenant 
the rock would be open to him of mum and few navy of court or men of any other description can have had such a range 
but what restrictions i 8 persuasion 
might impose on the are of the plenum-grenade it another thing 
i am not fond of the idea 
of my chin

and i should recommend mix allied to on her guard with mpectro her power garden 
i am very little to grant 4 tenant of kellynch hall any extra infamy favour i near you be he sailor or soldiers

— a in all the calm there are blushed unspent which take every thing plain and en between landlord and tenant

it seemed an if mr shepherd in thin anxiety to speak sir water s good will towards a naval office at tenant had been gifted with foresight 
for the very first application for the home war from an admiral crept with whom he shortly afterward fell into company in attending the quarter mansion at aunt 
and indeed he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent 
by the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make admiral profit wan a native of someneuhire who having acquired a very handsome fortune mat within to settle in hit own country and had come down to aunt in order to look at home advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited him

it proceeded however 
and though sir walker must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think them infinitely too well i 
in being to rent it on the highest terms he was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the tray and autinrin'ng him to wait on admiral profit who still retained ll barton and x a day for the home being seen

in all their dealing and intercourse sir walker elliott man ever have the proof audience 
nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth but her inclination war growing no strong for a removal that 
he war happy to have it bred and excited by a tenant at hand 
and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her 
mr shepherd was completely empowered to act 
and no sooner had each an end been reached than anne who had been a more attentive llltl‘nel to the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her rushed cheeks and at the walked along a favourite grove laid with a gentle high a few months more and be perhaps may be walking here

and having no parent living found a home for half a year at montoni 
he war at that time a remarkably one young man with a great deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancy 
and anne an extremely elms 
girl with gentleman modesty taste and feeling 
all the m of attraction on either side might have been enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love 
but the encounter of such evil recommendations could not fail 
they were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and deeply in love 
it would be difficult to lay which had been highest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest the in receiving his declarations and proposed or he in having them accepted 
a short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short one 
trouble noon arose 
sir waiters on being applied to without actually withhold hill consent or ca age it should never be gave it all the negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter 
he thought it a very degrading alliance 
and lady cassel though with more temper and pardonable pride received it as a most unfortunate one 
anne elliott with all her claims of birth beauty and mind to throw herself away at nineteen 
involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself to recommend him and no 
hope attaining allluerme but in the chance of a most uncertain profession and no connexion to secure even hit farther ride in that profession would be indeed i throwing away which she grieved to think of l anne elliott so young 
known to so few to be matched off by a danger without alliance or fortune 
or rather united by him into a name of most wearing anxious youths msunslox

pennyworth had no fortune 
he had been lucky in his profession 
but impending freely what had come freely had relied nothing 
it be war confident that he should noon be rich full office end 
door he knew that he should soon have a ship and soon be on a nation that would lad to everything he wanted 
he had always been lucky 
he knew he should he i will 
such confidence 
powerful in in own warmth and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it men have been enough for anne 
but lady unwell saw it very differently 
his languid temper and fearless of mind operated very differently on her 
she law in it but an aggravation of the evil 
it only added a dangerous character to himself 
he wan brilliant he wan headstrong 
lady quell had little not for wit and of anything approaching to impudence a honor 
she deprecated the connexion in every get 
such opposition at these feelings produced was more than anne could combat 
young and gentle robe wan it might at have been possible to within her ﬁlthcr'l ill-will though softened by one kind word or look on the part of her finger 
but lad cassel whom the had always loved and relied on cox d not with much readiness of opinion 
and such tenderness of manner be continually dividing her in vain 
she was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing indiscreet improper hardly capable of succour and not deserving it 
but it we not a merely selfish caution under which she acted in putting an end to it 
had the not imagined himself consulting allall good even more than her own she could hardly have given him up 
the belief of persuasion 
2 7 being prudent and self-denying principally for life advantage was her chief consolation under misery of a parting a final ring 
and every consolation required for the he to encounter all the additional pain of opinions on his side mull unconvinced and unbending and of his 
feeling him f ill used by in forced a reii’nquiahmenn he had left the country in consequence 
a few month had been the beginning and the end of their acquaintance 
but not with a few months ended anne share of suffering from it 
her attachment and regret had for a in time clouded every enjoyment of youth and an early foot of bloom and print had been their lasting effect 
more than even year were gone since thin little history of sorrowful interest had reached in close 
and time had softened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him but he had been too dependent on time alone 
no aid had been given in change of place except in one visit to bath soon afterthe rupture or in any novelty or enlargement of society 
no one had ever come within the kellynch circle who could bear a comparison with frederick pennyworth i he wood in her memory 
no second attachment the only thorough 
natural happy and ancient cure at her lime of i had been possible to the nice tone of her mind the faan'diuuaneu of her taste in the small limits of the society around them 
she had been solicited when about two-und-twenty to change her name by the young man who not long afterward found a more will mind in her young or litter and lady quell had averted her a for charles misgive was the eldest son of a man whose landed property and general importance were second in that country only to sir waters and of good character and appearance 
and however lady unwell might have c 28 
watson 
asked yet for nothing more wluleannewnincreen the would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-one no respectably removed from the and injustice of her father's house and settled an permanently never beheld 
but in thin clue anne had left nothing for advice to do 
end though key quell 
a melted a feverish hernwndilcretion neverwilheddiepmundone she began now to have the anxiety which harden on noblemen for answer being tempted by some man of talent and independence to enter a me for which the held her to be peculiarly ended by her warm affection and domestic habit 
they knew not each other opinion either in convey or in change on the one lendinglpointof anne conduct for the subject war never alluded to 
but anne at seven-and-twenty though very 15 
de from what the lad been made to think at nineteen 
she did not blame key unwell he did not blame herself for having been guided by her 
but he felt that were my young person in similar circummncec to apply to her for counsel they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness inch uncertain texture good 
she wapenuaded that under every disadvantages of in proportion at home and every anxiety attending him am caution all their probable fears delay and dilapntmenu the should yet have been i happier woman in maintaining the engagement than he had been in the sacrifice of it 
and that the fully believed had the usual share had even more than 11 m here fill each solid clouded and never been their without reference to the actual 1 of their case which an it happened 
would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could he reuomhly calculated on 
all his sanguine expectation all his conscience had been justified

he had distinguished himself and early gained the other up in rank and me now by successive rapture have madeahandaome fortune 
she had only navy lists and newspaper for her authority but the could not doubt his being rich 
and in favour of his 
company she had no man to believe him married 
how ll vent could anne elliott have been 
how eloquent at cut were her while on the side of early warm attachment 
and a cheerful confidence in purity again that over-anxious caution which seem to insult exertion and dismal providence 
she had been forced into prudence in her youth the learned romance up the grew older the natural queen of an unnatural be naming 
it all these circumstances recollections and feeling she could not hear that captain wentworth’a i'lﬂel‘ was likely to live at kill c without a revival of former pain 
and many a trot l and many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea 
she often told here it was full before the could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the sofa and their business no evil 
she war animated however by that perfect indifferent and apparent unconacioueneu among the only three of her own friend the secret of the part which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it 
she could do justice to the mud purity of lad ruuell’s motives in this over those of her father elizabeth 
ll could honour all the better feelings of her alone 
but the general air of opinion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung 
and in the event of admiral profits really king kellynch hall the rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her of the part being known to those three only among her so runsmsrorr 
connexion by whom no syllables the believed would ever be whilperedﬁnd in the trultthatnmonghigthe brothers with whomhehadbeenreidinglud received any information of their than-lived engagement

the filled a cross had then been out of england icoonrpanyin her husband on a foreign station end her own sister mary had been at school whilst all occurred 3 and never admitted by the pride of name and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge of it afterward 
with there more the hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the cross which with lady quell till redder in kellynch and mary vexed only three miles toil must be anticipated need not involve any particular awkwardness 
theatre 17 
no the morning a indeed for admiral and my profit seeing ellynch hall anne found it met natural to take her almost daily walk to lady ruuell’a and keep out of the way till all was over 
when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had minded the opportunity of seeing them 
thin meeting of the two oriel proved highly satisfactory and decided the who e business at once 
each lady wan previously well dispelled for in agreement and saw nothing therefore but good manners in the other 
and with regard to the gentlemen there was inch an hearty good humour such an open musing liberality on rsnsussrou 
31 the admirals side as could not but influence sir walker who had besides been scattered into his very best and most lashed behaviour by mr shepherd assurances of his gang known by report to the admiral as a model of good breeding 
the house and grounds and furniture were approved the carts were approved terms time every thing and every body was right 
and mr shepherd clerks were set to work without there having been a single imaginary difference to of a that 
this in nature showeth.” sir walker without hesitation declared the admiral to be the finest-looking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to by that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where 
and the admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife as they drove back through the park 
i thought we should soon come to a deal my clear in spite of what they told us at aunt 
the baronet will never set the shame on here but there seems no harm in him 
reciprocal compliment which would have been esteemed about 2 ll 
the carts were to have possession at michaelmas 
and as sir walker proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement 
lad cassel convinced that anne would not be allow to be of any use or any importance in the choice of the house which they were going to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she 
might convey her to bath herself after christmas 
but having engagements of her own which must take her from kill much for several weeks she was unable to give the fun invitation she wished and anne 32 mansion 
thonghdmtingthepodrlehmofswaherinaﬂ thewhinghnoand mforegoallthe inﬂuenoenneetandao oftheamumnalnootha intbeeountry didnotthinkthat evaytbingoonidemd something occurred however to give her a different duty 
mary often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming anne when anything was me butter was indisposed 
and foreseeing think she could not have a day health all the autumn entreated or rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to one to us to 
course and bear her on as long lhtppflmtonld want her instead of gain i can not possibly do without one was mary’maoning 
and elizabeth reply wan then i am gales anne had better stay for nobody will want her in my 
to be claimed at a good though in an improper at e in at 
lent better than being rejected an no good at all 
and anne glad to be thought of acre use glad to have anything marked out an a duty and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country and her own dear country readily a reel to my 
this invitation of any removed all lady russell's difficulties and it was con nearly noon settled that anne should not go to bath tie l lady unwell took her and that all the interesting time should be divided between a cross cottage and kellynch lodge 
so far a wan perfectly right 
but lady unwell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the kcllynch hall plan when it hunt on her which was mimic clay'being engaged to go to bath with sir water and elizabeth an a most important and valuable assistant to the persuasion 
33 latter in ill the business before her 
lady cassel was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered grieved and feared 
and the front it contained to anne in mrs clay s being of so much use while anne could be of none was i very sore aggravation 
anne herself was become hardened to such nﬂ'ronu but she felt the importance of the arrangement unite st keenly a lady cassel 
with a great deal is quiet observation and a knowledge which she often wished less of her father s character the was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible 
she did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind 
mrs clay had freckled and a projecting tooth and s clump wrist which he was continually making severe remarks m in her absence 
but the was young and certainly it either well-looking and possessed in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merelypersnnal might have been 
anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it per liable to her sister 
she had little hope of succour t elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself should never she thought have reason to reproach her for giving no warning 
she spoke and seemed only to offend 
elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantly answered for each parrys perfectly knowing their situation 
a mrs clay said she warmly 1 never forgets who she is 
and an i am rather better acquaint with her sentiments than you can be i can assure you that upon the of marriage they are particularly nice and that she reprobate all inequality of condition and rank more 34 nasuasrou 
one than most people 
and at to my father i reallyalmldnothave thoughtthathev/hohaakept himoelflin elolnngfor our likely need be expected now 
if ll clay were a very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her to much with me 
not that anything in the world i am sure would induce my father to make a degrading match but he might be rendered unhappy 
but 5 my cloak who with all her merit can never have no reckon tolerably melt i really think 5 no claim ma be star in hire iii perfect safety 
poison would or had never heard my father speak of her person i often though i know you must fifty times 
that tooth of hen and those freckled 
frock do not divert me to very much a they do him 
i have known a nice not materially figured by a few but he abominate them 
you must have heard him notice men clay tackle 
a there is hardly any personal defect replied anne 1 which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to 
i think very differently answered elizabeth shortly 
an agree manner may out off handsome features but can never alter plain ones 
however at any rate at i have a great deal more at stake on thin point than anybody else can have i think it rather unnecessary in you to he advising me 
anne had done 
glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless of doing good 
elizabeth 
though reading the suspicion 
might yet be made observant by it 
the last choice of the four carriage-horse war to draw sir water in idiot and mrs clay to bath 
the party drove off in very good spirit 
sir walker prepared with condescending how for all the afflicted tenants and concern who might have had a hint to pnsussron 
35 how themselves and anne walked up it the same time in a sort of desolate tranquillity to the lodge where he was to spend the tent week 
her friend was not in better lpll'lll than herself 
lady quell felt this break-up of the family exceedingly 
their respectability was as dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become tedious by habit 
it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds and still worse to anticipate the new hand they were to fall into 
and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of to altered i village and be out of the way when admiral find mrs profit lime arrived she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up anne 
accordingly their removal was made together and anne was set own at uppermost cottage in the list stage of lady russell’s vast 
uppercrou was a moderate-sized village which a few years back had been completely in the old english style containing only two houses interior in appearance to those of the women and labourers 
the mansion of the squire with its high walls great gates and old trees substantial and modernised and the compact might manage enclosed in its own neat garden with a vice and a partner trained round it casements 
but upon the marriage of the young squire it had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into i cottage for his residence and uppercrous cottage with its vivant french windows and other prettiness was quite as likely to catch the travellers eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the great house about a quarter of a mile farther on 
here anne had often been staying 
she knew the ways of uppermost as well as those of kellynch 
the two families were so continually meeting so much in the habit of running in and out of each others house at ill 36 newnsrou 
honmthnitwunthereurpﬁcm her boundary alone 
but being alone her being unwell and out of spirit was almost a matter of course 
though better endowed than the elder linger mary had not accept understanding nor temper 
while well and happy and properly attended to the had great humour and excellent spirits 
but any and tuition tumult her completely 
she had no resource or solitude 
and inheriting a conﬁdenhle ill of the idiot self-importance wet very prone to add to ever other time that of fancying herself neglected and i told 
in person the wet inferior to both bitter and had even in her bloom only reached the did pity of being 
a one girl 
she was now lying on the dead tour of the pretty little drawing-room 
the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing tray under the influence of four manner and two children 
and on anne appearing greeted her with 
a so you are come at him 
i began to think i should never see you 
i am to ill i can hardly peak 
i have not been a creature the whole morning 
a i am sorry to and you unwell replied anne 
a you tent me such a good account of yourself on thursday 
yet i made the heat of it 
i always do but i was very far from well at the time 
and i do not think i ever was to ill in my life at i have been all this morning very unfit to he left alone i am tore 
s note i were to he seized of a suddenly in tone dread us way and not able to ring the hall i so lady butter would not get out 
i do not think the hat been in this house three time that turned 
anne said what was proper and enquired after her husband 
2 the 
charles it out shooting 
i have not seen him since seven o'clock 
he would go though i told him how ill i was 
he said he should not stay persuasion 
3 7 oblong 
but he hat never come back and now it in alrnottone 
iamreyoui have not seen a too thin whole long morning 
you have had your little boy with you i a yew an long an i could bear their noise 
but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good 
little charles does not mind i word i any and alter it growing quite as bad 
a well you will noon be better now a replied anne cheerfully 
you know i always cure you when i come 
how are your neighbour at the great home e 
i can give you no account of them 
i have not seen one of them to-day except mr grove 
who just stopped and spoke through the window but without getting all hit home 
and though i told him how ill i was not one of them have been near me 
it did not happen to suit the main gravel i suppose and they never out themselves out of their way 
oh will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone 
it in early 
a i never want them i assure you 
the talk and laugh a great deal too much for me 
oh 
sure i am in very unwell 
it was quite unkind of you not to come on thunday.” 1 my dear mary recollect what comfortable account you lent me of yourself 
you wrote in the cheerful manner and aid you were perfectly well and in no hurry for me 
and that being the case you must be aware that my will would be to remain with lady vessel to the last and besides what i felt on her account i have all been so busy have had it much to do that i could not very conveniently have left kill much sooner a ear me 
what can join possibly have to do 2 a a great many things i assure you 
more than i can recollect in a moment 
but i can tell you some 
i 38 persuasion 
seventeen making i duplicity of the dialogue of my other books and i have been several times the men with mackenzie trying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeth plants are for lady quell 
i have had all my own little con 
term to arrange book and music to divide and all my trunk pack from not having understood in time what wan intended as to the wagon and one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying nature going to almost every house in the parish up a none of takelenve.. i was told that they wished it 
but all these things took up i great deal of time 
a oh well i 
and after a moment paused a but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the pool yesterday 
did you go then 
i have made no enquiries because i concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party 
oh yes 
i went 
i was very well yesterday 
nothing at all the matter with me till thin morning 
it would have been strange if i had not gone 
4 i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a plenty party 
nothing remarkable 
one always known beforehand what the dinner will be and who will be there 
and it it to very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one own 
mr and my grove took me and we were in crowded 
they are both no very large and take up so much room 
and mr grove always rites forward 
so there was i crowded into the back meat with henrietta and louisa 
and i think it very likely that my illness to-day may be owing to it a little farther perseverance in patience and formed cheerfulness on anne's aside produced nearly a cure on to 
she could noon at upright on the sofa and begun to hope the might be able to leave it by dinnerpersuasion 
39 time 
then forgetting to think of it she was at the other end of the room gratifying a note 
then she ate her cold melt 
and then she war we enough to i little walk 
a where shall we go 
a said the when they were ready 
if you will not like to call it the gum house before they have been to lee you 
a i have not the smaller 
objection on that account 1 replied anne 
i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as men and the mist mungmves 
a a 
oh 
they ought to call upon you as soon as possible 
they ought to feel what in due to you an m deter 
however we may as well go and sit with them a little while and when we have got that over we can enjoy our walk anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly am sent 
but she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing that though there were on each side continual subjects of offence neither family could now do without it 
to the get home accordingly they went to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour with a small carpet and shining floor to which the present daughter of the house were usually giving the proper sir of conclusion by a grand piano-forte and a harp ﬂower-stands and little tables faced in every direction

their dread had every advantage their faces were rather pretty their spirits extremely good their manners embarrassed and lament 
they were of consequence at home and iamuritea abroad 
anne always contemplated them at some of the happiest creature of her acquaintance but still moved as we all are by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyment 
and envied them nothir‘tlg but that seemingly perfect good understanding an agreement together that good-humoured mutual affection of which she had known so little hero self 7th either of her sisters 
they were received with great cordiality 
nothing seemed air on the side of the great house family which was generally at anne very well knew the lean to blame

of the cottage animal to comfort 
he wan away on friendly permit her brother-in-law 
and in the children who loved her nearly ii well and repeated her a great deal more than their mother she had an object of interest amusement and wholesome exertion 
charles grove was civil and agreeable 
in tents and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation or grace to make the past as they were connected together at all a dangerous contemplation 
though at the lame time anne could believe with lady recall that a more equal match might have greatly improved him 
and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to ill 
calmer and more usefulness rationality and elegance to hit habit and pursuing 
a it was he did nothing with much zeal but sport 
and his time was otherwise rolled away without benefits from books or anything else 
he had very good spirit which never seemed much affected by his wife occasional lowness bore with her unrealonablcnm sometimes to accept watson 
43 admiration and upon the whole though there war very often a little diugreernent in which the had sometime morerhuethanuhewinhed being appealed to both parties they might put for a happy couple 
they were a way perfectly agreed in the want of more money and i strong inclination for a handsome present from his father 
but here an on most topics he had the superiority for while mary thought it a great than that such a t was not made he always contended for his face i have many other use for ellis money and a right to mend it up be liked 
all to the management of their children he there war much better than hit wife and his practice not no bad 
i could manage them very well if it were not for many interference wan what anne often heard him lay and had a good deal of faith in 
but when listening in turn to mary reproach of a charles la the children to that i can not get them into any of her 4 the never had the intellect temptation to lay a very true 
one of the lean 
agreeable circuit of her residence there wan her being treated with too much confidence ball and go too much the secret of the complaint of each house 
known to have nine influence with her lined the wan continually equalled or it lean receiving hints to exert it beyond what was advisable 
a i wish you could penury e mary not to always fancy g herself ill was charlotte language 
and inns on puppy mood thus spoke mary i do believe if charles were to see me dying he would not think there war anything the matter with me 
i am sure anne if you would you might persuade him that i really am very ill 
a great deal worse than i ever own 
mary'declaration war 
i hate tending the children to the great home though their grandmama ll d 44 nesmsrou 
always wanting to see them for the humour and indulge them to locks i degree 
and given them to much trash and wet things that the are our to come back kick and crowd for the rent of the day 
and my reprove took the list opportunity of being alone with anne to my 1 oh i mine anne i can not help wishing my charge had a little of your method with that children 
they are quite different 
nature with you 
but to here in general they are no spoil it in a pity you can not put your litter in the way of managing they are a one healthy children a ever were ten poor little dear 
without partiality 
but my charles known no more how they should be treated 
l blue hue 
how troublesome they are sometimes 
i nature you mind anne it prevent my wishing to tie them it our home it often at i otherwise should 
i believe my charm it not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener 
but you know it ll very bad to have children with one that one in obliged to be checking every moment 
do n't do this a and do n't do that 
a or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than in good for them 1 she had this communication moreover from mary 
a mr grove think all her servant to stay that it would be high union to call it in question 
but i am sure without exaggeration that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid instead of being in their business are adding about the village all along 
i meet them wherever i go 
and i declare i never go twice into my nursery without feeling something of them 
if emma were not the truan'eet steadiest creature in the world it would be enough to spoil her 
for she tells me they are now i tempting her to take a walk with them 
2 and on a muegrove’l ride it was a i make 3 rule of never interfering in any of my daughter-in-law conceal for i know it would not do 
but i shall tell you persuasion 45 mien anne because you may be able to set things to right 
that i have no very good opinion of my charles nursery-maids i hear manage stories of her 
the in lay upon the glad 
and from my own knowledge i can declare the in such a line-dressing lady that the in enough to ruin any fervently the come near 
my charge quite mean by her i know 
but i just ve you this hint that you may be upon the watch 
use if you see anything miss you need not be afraid of mentioning it again 
it won mary s complaint that man grove wuveryapt not to give her the presence that her due when they dined at the great home with other families 
and the did not lee any remain why the wutobeconlidered to much it home one lose her place 
and one day when anne wan walking with only the main mulgrovee one of them after talking of united people of rank and jealousy of rank laid a i have no scruple of observing to you how nonsensical some persons are about their place become i the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it 
but i with anybody would give mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if the were not to very tenacious especially if she would not be always of putting herself forward to take place of common 
nobody doubts her right to have presence of me but it would be more becoming in her not to be always inclining on it 
it ll not that man came about it the lent in the world but i know it is taken notice of by many per 
none how was anne to let all these matters to right 
she could do little more than linen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each to the other 
give them all hint of the forbearance necessary between touch near neighbour and make tone hint broadest which were meant for her lingered benefit

in another reapectyherviait began and proceeded very well 
her own spirit improved by change of lace and rub cut by being removed three miles from kellynch 
mary ailments learned by having a constant nor noon and their daily inrereoune with the other far ye since there wan neither superior affection confidence nor employment in the cottage to be interested by it wan rather an advantage 
it war certainly carried near or far as possible for they met every morning a hardly ever spent an evening minded 
but the believed they should not have done to well without the eight of mr and mr muegrvve’l able form in the rival places or without the talking laughing and singing of their daughters 
he played a great deal better than either of the main muegrovee but having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parents to it by and fancy themselves delighted her performance wan little thought of only out of civility or to refresh the other arm the war well aware 
she knew that when the played the was giving pleasure only to herself 
but this was no new sensation 
excepting one short period of her life the had never since the age of fourteen never since the loan of her dear mother known the happiness of being listened to or encouraged by any just appreciating or real taste 
in much she had been always used to feel alone in the world 
and mr and my mulgrnve’e fond partiality for their own daughter performance and total indifference to any other person gave her much more pleasure for their lakes than mortification for her own 
the duty at the great home war sometimes increased my other company 
the neighbourhood was not large but the murgroves were visited by everybody and had more dinner-parties and more called more visitor invitation and by chance than any other family

i am glad i did not think of it before 
how low it make me i 
the crowd took union with true naval alert and were to be ended 
mary deplored the necessity for herself 
a nobody knew how much the should asunder 
she should put it of an long an she could 
a but was not easy till the had talked charles into driving her over on an early day and war in a very animated comfortable at 
of imaginary agitation when he came back 
anne had very sincere rejoiced in there being nomeanlofhergoing 
she bowed together sofa and was glad to be within when the visit was returned 
they came the master of the house viii 48 persuasion 
notlthome butthetwoslltenwere together 
and as it chanced that mrs crowd fell to the share of anne while the admiral sat by mary and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little ha i 
she was well able to watch for a likeness and if it far end her in the features to catch it in the voice brain the turn of sentiment and expression 
mrs profit 
though neither tall nor fat had a sourness upright and vigour of form which gave importance to her person 
she had bright dark eyes good teeth and altogether an agreeable face 
though her relented and wather-beaten complexion the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty 
her manners were open easy 
and decided like one who had no distrust of herself and no doubts of what to do 
without any approach to coarseness however or any want of good humour 
anne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration towards herself in all that related to kellyneh and it pleased her especially a she had stationed herself in the very warm half minute in the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest s m in of any knowledge or supper in on mrs profits idlest give a bias of an sort 
she was quite easy on that head and consequently my full of enough and courage till for a moment electriﬁed by mrs fro as suddenly saying 
a it was you and not your sister i and that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this country 
anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing 
but the age of emotion she certainly had not 
a perhaps you may not have heard that he in married 1 added me profit 
she could now answer as she ought 
and viii happy persuasion 
49 to feel when on soft s next word explained it to be mr pennyworth of whom the spoke that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother 
she immediately felt how reasonable it was that mrs profit should be thinking and speaking of edward and not of frederick 
and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former mei labours present state with proper interest 
he he 
was all tranquillity 
till just as they were he heard the admiral ay to mary 
— a e are expecting a brother of my profits here soon 
i dare any you know him by me 
he was cut short by the eager attack of the line boys clinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go 
and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pocket em to have another moment for fishing or recollect what he had begun anne we left to persuade herself an well an she could that the name brother must still be in question 
she could not however reach such a degree of certainly as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house where the cross had previously been calling 
the folks of great house were to spend the evening of this day the cottage 
and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot the coach wan beginning to be listened for when the youngest nice grove walked in 
that she was coming to apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves war the first black idea 
and ma was quite ready to be affronted when louisa made a 1 right by saying that the only came on foot 
to leave more room for the harp which was bringing in the carriage 
2 and i will tell you our reason 1 she added and all about it 
i am come on to give you notice that so nasuasrou 
papa and mamma are out of appear a thatevening 
mamma 
the in thinking to much of poor richard and agreed it dbebeettohavetheharp for it seem to announce her more than the comforter 
i will tell you why the in out of spirit 
hen the crowd called this morning they called here afterward did not they vi they happened to ray that her brother captain unworthy 
ll just returned to england or paid or something and in coming to see rash almost directly 
and most unluckily it came into mamma head when they were gone that pennyworth or something very like it was the name of poor richard metal at one time 
i do not know when or where but a great while before he died poor fellow and upon looking over his letters thing the found it war no and it perfectly acute that thin coat be the very man and her head it quite full of it and of poor richard i so we must all be an merry ii we can that the may not be dwelling upon each gloomy thing the real crrcumnancea of thin pathetic piece of family hunters were that the muagrovea had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome hopeless son and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year 
that he had been sent to sea because he wan stupid and unmanageable on shore 
that he had been very little cared for at any time by bit family though quite at much at he deserved 
seldom hard of and parcel at all regretted when the intelligence of hit death a road had worked in way to uppercrou two year before 
he had in fact though he line were now doing all they could for him by calling him a poor richard a been nothing better than a thick-headed unfeeling unprofitable dick grove who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the alleviation of hit name living or dead

and from the laconic he had under the influence of his captain written the only two learn which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of hit abet-nee 
that in to lay the only two disinterested letter all the mat had been mere i diction for money 
to each letter he had upon well office captain 
but yet no little were they in the habit of attending to inch pattern no unobservant and curious were they i to the name of men or chap that it had made scarcely any impression at the time 
and that my mule should have been suddenly mock thin very day with a recollection of the name of wanton an connected with her in seemed one of those extraordinary hum of mind which do sometimes occur 
she had gone to her letters and found it all as the supported 
and the perpetual of these letters after so long an interval her poor in gone for ever and all the strength of his fault forgotten had greeted her spirit exceedingly and thrown her into greater grief for him than ill 
had known on lit hearing of his 
death 
mr grove wan in a lesser degree affected likewise 
and when they reached the cottage they were evidently in want rest of being listened to new on thin object and afterwards of all the relief which cheerful companions could give 
to hear them talking so much of captain pennyworth repeating his name to often puzzling over put can an at last ascertaining that it night that it probably would turn out to be the very same captain pennyworth whom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back from clifton

more and captain wanton w known to be at kellynch and mr grove had called on him and come back warm in ma place and he was engaged with the coat to dine at supper by the and of another week

but a week must pass 
only a walk in angel reckoning and then the supposed the muutmcet 
answer the began with that he can 4 feel secure even for a week 
captain pennyworth made a very early return to mr mulgmve't civility and the wan all but calling therein rnsmsron

the child situation put the village entirely aside 
but he could not heat of her cope with indifference even in the midst of the antique variety which they afterwards felt on his account he collar-hone was found to he delicate 
and such injury received in the back an roused the mot 
alarming in it wan an afternoon of times 
my anne had everything to do at once 
the apothecary to send for the father to have pursued and informed the mother to support and keep from hysterics 
the servant to control the youngest child to banish and the poor suffering one to attend end soothe 
besides lending at soon as the collect it proper notice to the other house which brought her an accession rather of frightened enquiring cnmmnionc than of very useful anietantu 
her brother s return wan the in comfort 
he could take best care of hit wife 
and the second blessing was theatrical of the apothecary 
till he came and had examined the child their appnhenlionl were the worse for being vague 
they spend great injury but knew not where 
but now the collar-hone wan anyone replied and though mr robinson felt and felt and moved and looked grave and polite low word 
both to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the bent and to he able to it and eat their dinner in tolerable clue of mind 
a then it was just before they parted that the two young aunt were able to far to figures from their m free state at to give the information of captain entworth’u visit 
lying over minutes behind their father and mother to endeavour to express perfectly delighted they were with him how much hands persuasion 
under hwinlinitelymoreegneebletheythought him than any moving their male acquaintance who had been it all a favourite before 
how glad they had been to hear papa invite him to my dinner how sorry when he did it was quite out of his power and how glad again when he had promised to reply to papa and mamma farther perusing invitation to come and dine with them on the morrow 
actually on the morrow 
and he had examined it in to presume i manner at if he felt all the motive of their attention ifbut ii he ought

the came story and the name autumn were repeated when the two girl came with their father through the room of the evening to make inquiries 
and mr grove no longer under the hat matineeabout hit heir could add hall confirmation and pride and hope there would be now no occasion for putting captain pennyworth off and only he sorry to think that the cottage party probably would not like to leave the little boy to give himthemeetin 
oh 
no 
up to leaving the little boy both there and mother were in much too rug and recent alarm to hear the thought 
end anne in the joy of the escape could not help adding her warm pmtenatione to theirs 
charles grove indeed afterward there more of inclination 4 the child going on to well and he wished to much to be introduced to captain pennyworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening 
he would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour 
but in thin he was early opened by his 
wife with a oh 
no indeed charles

but what wan there for a father to do 
thin wan quite fertile came and it would be highly abound in him who could be of no name at home to shut himself up 
his father much 
wished him to meet captain pennyworth a there being no ancient reason again it he ought to go 
and it ended in his making a. bold public declaration when he came in from shooting of his meaning to deal direct and dine at the other home 
nothing can be going on better than the child a laid he

my dear child 
the next moment he was applying at her husband's dressing-room door and a anne followed her up in the war in time for the whole conversation which began with mary crying in a tone of great exultation 
i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more see at home than you are 
if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child i should not be able to de him to do anything he did not like 
anne 17 may 
anne undertakes to nay at home and take cup of him 
it in manners own pupil and no i dull go with you which will be a great deal better for i have not dined at the other house since then

to nun our wick child 
anne was now i 
hand to take up her own entree and the sincerity of her manner being noon sufficient to convince him where conviction me it lean very agreeable he had no farther scruple c to her being left to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the evening when the child might be 1 rent for the night and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her but the wall quite on em and thin being the use the had ere long the place of seeing them net of together in high spirits 
they were gone 
the hoped w happy haweveroddl conltructedmch happiness might seem 
as for herself the was left with a may sensation of comfort 
i were perhaps ever likely to he hen 
she knew herself to be of the hat utility to the child 
and what wan it to her if frederick pennyworth were only half a mile lieu making himself gentle to other 
she would have liked to know how he felt an to a meeting 
perhaps indifferent 
if indifference could exist under inch circumstanced 
he man be either indifferent or unwilling 
had he wished ever to see her again he need not have waited till thin time 
he would have done what he could not but believe that in hit place the should have done long ago when evening had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting 
her brother and time came back delighted with my new acquaintance and their visit in general 
there had been music ringing talking laughing ill that wan mount agreeable 
charming manner in captain pennyworth no shine or retire 
they seemed all we know each other perfectly and he was coming the very next morning m foot with curled 
he was in come persuasion 
50 to hreakl'an but not at the cottage though that had bunpmpoeedat lit 
better hehadbeen precede come to the great home invalid and he seemed afraid of being in my charge muagrove’l way on account of the child and therefore somehow they hardly knew how it ended in charles being to meet him to breakfast at his father 
anne understood it 
he wished to avoid eyeing her 
he had inquired after her she found slightly as might suit a former alight maintenance seeming to acknowledge each a she had a ledge actuated perhaps by the me view of escaping introduction when they were to meet 
the morning hours of the cottage were always later than those of the other houses end on the narrow the difference was no great that mary and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when charles came in to ray that they were just getting on that he was come for his dogs that his sister 
were following with ca m pennyworth 
hit him meaning to visit mary an the child and captain pennyworth proposing allow to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient 
and though charles had answered for the children being in no such state an could make it inconvenient pennyworth would not be gathered without his running on to give notice 
mary very much gratified by this attention was delighted to receive him while a thousand feelingnrahed on anne of which thin won the most consoling that it would noon be over 
and it vie noon over 
in two minute after charles preparation the other a red 
they were in the drawing-room 
her eye met captain wentworth’l a how a county pulled 
the heard his voice 
he talked to mary hid all that war right said something to the mind not grown enough to mark an easy footing 
the more 
i ca 
soon however the began to men with herself and try to be feeling leaf 
eight years about eight years had planned since all hid hem given up 
how absurd to be returning the agitation which inch an interval had behind into time and indiuinme-l what might not eight years do 
event of every description 
change alternation removals 
all all must be comprised in it and obligation of the 
how natural bow remain took it included my a third part of her own life 
alas 
with all her morning the mind that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing 
now how were his sentiments to be read 
wan while waiting to avoid her 
and the next moment the w hating herself for the folly which melted the question 
on one other moon which chapel her under wind might not have prevented was noon spared all w 
for after the main mungmves had returned and finished their visit it the cottage the had this iponhneoua information from mary 
captain pennyworth it not very gallant by you a nnsmssrou 
31 anne though he we 
so attentive to me 
henrietta asked him when he thought of you when they went away and he laid a you were in entered he should not have known you again a mary had no feeling make her respect her letter in a common way but ill was perfectly unnupieimn of being inflicting any line wound 
scattered here knowledge anne fully submitted in kent deep mortification 
doubled it we no and he could take no revenge for he wan not altered or not for the one 
she had already acknowledged it to herself and he could not think denny let him think of her ii he would 
no the year which had decayed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manly open look in no prospect lessening his moral adnnmgeu 
she had been the lame frederick unworthy 
so altered that he should not have known her again 
a these were words which could not but dwell with her 
yet the soon began to rejoice that the had heard them 
they were of sobering tendency 
they allayed agitation 
they composed end consequently mum make her happier 
frederick pennyworth had used such words or something like them but without an idea that they would he carried round to her 
he had thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of eyed had spoken no he felt 
he had not forgiven nine elliott 
she had used him ill daertednnd dine hated him

there was a momentary expression in ca m pennyworth s face at this speech a certain case of his bright eye and curl of his handsome month which convinced anne that indeed of sharing in mrs musgmve's kind wishes as to her now he had probably been at some closet rid of him 
but it was transient an in urgency of self-amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself 
in mother moment he was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterward coming up to the sofa on which she and mrs must ve were sitting 
took a place by the latter and enter into conversation with her in a low voice about her in doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace st then the kindest consideration for all that was real and unbound in the parents feelings 
they were actually on the same sofa for mrs grove had most readily made room for him they were divided only by m rave 
it was no insignificant barriers indeed 
my glove was of a comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment 
and while the agitations of manners leader form and pensive face may be considered as very completely screened captain pennyworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat fighting over the destiny of a son whom alive nobody had cared for 
personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proposing 
a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction as the most graceful net of limbs in the world 
but fair or not fair there are unbecoming conjunction which reason will patronized in vain 
which taste can not tolerate 
which ridicule will seize 
the admiral after taking two or three refreshing mansion 
by turnabout the room with his hand behind him being called to order by his wife now came up to captain wentwtmh 
and without any observation of what he might be interrupting thinking only of his own thought began with 
if you had been a week later at labor lent spring fredeﬁchyonwmddhavebeeoukedcogiveapulage to lady mary grievous and her daughter should i 
i am glad i wan not a week later then in the admiral abused him for his want of gallant 
he defended himself though professing that he w d never willingly admit any ladies on board a ships of his excepting for no hills or a visit which a few laurel might comprehend 
but if i know myself a said he a thin in from no want of gallantry toward them 
it is rather from feeling how impmeihle it is with all one effort and all once sacrifice to make the accommodations on board such an women ought to have 
there can he no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort ago and thin in what i do 
i hate to hear of women on board for to face them on board 
and no chap under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it this brought his deter upon him 
a oh l frederick 
but i can not believe it of you 
— all idle refinement 
women may be as comfortable on board an in the best home in england 
i believe i have lived a much on board as most women and i know nothing superior to the accommodation of a manof-war 
i declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall with a kind how to anne 1 beyond what i always had in most of the chin 
l have lived in 
and they have been ever altogether a do summon 
nothing to the prepare a her burn 
a you were living with your hunting were the only women on board a but you yourself brought my service her under her cousin and the three children round from portsmouth to plymouth 
where wan this eurerﬁne extraordinary none of gallantry of your then up a a ill marked in my friendship s in 
i would and any brother oﬂioer'c wife that could and i would bring anything of harville'e from the world end if he wanted it 
but do not imagine that i did not feel it an evil in itself au“pep€iid upon it they were all perfectly comforter 
a i might not 
like them the better for at perhaps 
such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board a my dear frederick you are talking quite idly 
pray what would become of us poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to one port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feeling 1 
a feeling 
you see did not resent my taking my hydrv'ille and all her family to i‘llymouthl 1 but i hate to hear you talk in to like a one gentle 
man and an if women were all one ladies winner of rational culture 
we none of in expect to be in month water all our days 
ah 
my dear aid the admire a when he he 
got i wife he will sing a different tune 
when he ll married if we have the good luck to live to another war we shall ice him do as on and i and a great many others have done 
e shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him hit wife 
ay that we hall a now i have done a cried captain pennyworth 
a when once married people begin to attack me with 
persuasion 
7 l oh you will think very differently when you are married a i can only say no i shall not 
2 and then they again yet you will 2 and there in an end of it he got up and moved away 
what a great traveller you must have been man a mind my grove to on soft 
pretty well man in the after year of my marriage 
though many women have done more 
i have closed the atlantic four time and have been once to the eat indies and back again and only once 
besides being in different place about home cook and ribbon and gibraltar 
but i never went beyond the straight and never vice in the west india 
we do not call beamed or blame you know the went india men reprove had not a word to say in distant 
she could not accuse herself of having ever calledthem anything in the whole course of her if 
2 and i do nature you ma'am a paved mrcroft that nothing can exceed the accommodation of a man-of-war speak you know of the higher ran 
when come to a fringe of course you are more corn 
though any remarkable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them 
and i can safely say that the part of my life he been spent on board a hill 
while we were together you know there was nothing to be feared 
thank god 
i have always been blessed with excellent health and no climate disagree with me 
a little disordered always the list twenty-four hours of going to tea but never knew what sickness was afterwards 
the only time that i ever really suffered in body or mind the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell or had any ideas of danger 
was the winter that i saved by myself at deal when the admiral captain draft then was in the north 12 rnsmsxox 
seen

yes indeed oh i i am quite of your opinion on soft wan gift mungmve'l hearty answer 
there it nothing to bed at i question 
i am quite of your opinion 
i know what it in for mr grove always attend prize and 1 am no glad when they ire over and he is came back against the evening ended with dancing 
on in being provoked anne ordered her services ii veal 
and though herewwould sometime ill with tear 
up the not it the instrument the war extremely glad to be employed and desired nothing in return but to he unobserved 
t war a merry you try and no one seemed in higher spirits that plain unworthy 
she felt that a he had everything to elevate him which general attention and deference and e all the mention of iii the young woman could or he mill latterly the female of the family of caution alfred mentioned were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him 
and ii for henrietta and out they both named an entirely occupied by him that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could have made it credit that t were not decided rivals 
if he were a little t by inch universal such eager admiration who could wonder 1 there were come of the thought which occupied anne while her finger were mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together equally without error and without con-cioulneu 
one the felt that he was looking at himself observing her altered man perhaps pmunsrou 
3 trying to trace in them the man of the face which had once charmed him 
and out she knew that he must have spoken of her 
she was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer 
but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliott never danced 
the answer was a oh no never 
she has quite given dancing 
she had rather play 
she is never tired 3 playing 
once too he woke to her 
she had left the instrument on the dancing being over and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the miss musgroves an idea of 
intentionally she returned to that part of the room 
he saw her and instantly rising said with studied politeness 
a i beg your pardon madam this is your seat 
2 and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative he was not to induced to sit down again 
anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches 
his cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything 
cast 3 
captain pennyworth was come to kellynch as to a home to stay as in as he liked being as thoroughly the object of the admirals fraternal kindness as of his wife 
he had intended on first arriving to proceed very soon into such ire and visit the brother settled in that country 
but e attraction of uppermost induced him to put this off 
there was so much of friendliness and of pattern and of everything must bewitching in his reception there 
the old were so hospitable the young so agreeable that he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take all the charms and perfection of edward's wife upon credit i little longer

their dependence 
it was unvarying warm admiration everywhere 
but thiindrnate footing war not more than established when a certain charlehayter returned among them to he a good deal disturbed by it and to think captain pennyworth very much in the way 
charles hauteur was the eldest of all the confined and i very amiable pleading young man between whom and henrietta there had been a oonridemble appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworth'i introduction 
he war in order and having a curacy in the neighbourhood where residence war not tired lived up his father home only two mile fwd-nub em 
a short science from home had left till fair one guarded by his attention at thin critical riot and when he came back he had the pain of doing very altered manners and of seeing captain pennyworth 
my grave and man after were timbers 
they had each had money but their marriage had made a mute difference in their degree of consequence 
mr lawyer had come property of hit own but it wan inrigniﬁcnnt compared with mr mulgmve'e 
and while the summer were in the hat plan of society in the memory the young hateful would from their parents inhale 
retired and polished way of living and their arm defective education have been hardly in any can punsuuron 
is at all but for their connexion with up crown this elegant can of comic excepted who had c c to be a scholar and a gentleman and who won very superior in cultivation and manner to all the rent 
the two failing had always been on excellent there there being no pride on one tide and no envy on the other and only much a conncioumcel of superiority in the mist approves at made them pleased to improve their can 
charles attendant to henrietta had been observed b her father and mother without any die routine 
twould not be a great match for her 
but henrietta lifted him a 
and henrietta 5 
seems to like him 
henrietta fully thought no herself before captain pennyworth tame 
but from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten 
which of the two shutters wo preferred by captain pennyworth wan as yet quite doubtful as far as anna observation reached 
henrietta was perhaps the prettiest louisa had the higher lpll'ltl 
and the knew not new whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him 
mr and mrs reprove either from seeing little or from an entire confidence in the direction of both their laughter and of all the young men who came near them seemed to leave everything to take its chance 
there was not the smallest up assurance of solicitude or remark about them in the maiden-house 
but it was different at the cottage the wing couple there were more disposed to regulate an wonder 
and captain pennyworth had not been above four or have times in the main mutgrovea’ company and charles later had but just run pained when anne had to listen to the opinion of her brother and either an to 15 what the one liked but 
charles gave it for pure mary for henrietta but quite agreeing that to have him marry either would be extremely delightful 
my persuasions 
charles 
had never been i pleasanter nun in his life 
and from what he had once heard captain pennyworth hinuelfuy war very cure that he had not made leaf than twenty thousand pounds by the war 
here war a fortune at once beside which there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war 
and he was rare captain pennyworth war a likely a man to dinner herself at any office in the navy 
oh 
it would i unpin match for either of hit time 
upon my word it would replied mary 
a dear me 
if he should else to any very great honor if he should ever he made i baronet lady pennyworth a round 
very well 
that would be a noble thing 
indeed for henrietta 
she would take place of me then and henrietta would not dislike that 
sir frederick and lady pennyworth 
it would be but a new creation however and i never think much of your new creation it united mary bent to think henrietta the one preferred on the very account of charles hated who pretension she wished to see put an end to 
she looked down very decidedly upon the hunters and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed 
very sad for herself and her children 
you know a rapid the 4 i can not think him at all a t match for henrietta 
and considering the alliance which the moreover have made the bar no right to throw herself away 
i do not think any young woman ha 
a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family and be giving had connections to those who have not been used to them 
and my who in charles hunter 
nothing but a country curate 
a most improper match for maria grove of uppererou 
her husband however would not agree with her rmussrou 
my here 
for besides having a regard for his cousin charles hauteur was an eldest son and he saw things as an eldest son himself 
now you are talking nonsense mary 2 was therefore his answer 
a it would not be a pen match for henrietta but charles has a very fair chance through the pieces of getting something from the bishop in the course of a year or two 
and you will please to remember that he is the eldest son 
whenever my uncle dies he steps into very pretty property 
the estate at winter is not less than two hundred and fifty acres besides e farm near summon which is some of the best land in the country 
i grant you that an of them but charles would be a very shocking match or henrietta and indeed it could not be 
he is the only one that could be possible 
but he is a very good-natured good sort of a fellow 
and whenever interior comes into his hands he will make a different sort of lace of it and live in s ve different sort of way 
an with that property he will 
never be a contemptible man 
good freehold property 
no 
no 
henrietta might do worse than many charles hauteur 
and if she has him and louisa can get captain pennyworth i shall be very well satisﬁed.” 1 charles may say what he pleases cried mary to anne as soon as he was out of the room 
but it would be shook so have henrietta marry charles hunter i ve be thing for her and still worse for m g and the one it is very much to he wished that captain pennyworth may soon put him quite out of her head and i have very little doubt that he has 
she took hardly any notice of charles hauteur yesterday 
i wish you had been there to see her behaviour 
and as to captain pennyworth s liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsense to say so 
for he certainly him like henrietta a great deal the best 
but charles is so positive 
3 pnnsussmn 
i wish you had been with us rested for then you might have decided between us 
and am sure you would have thought as i did unless you had been determined to give it against me 
a dinner at mr must moves had been the occasion when all these things show d have been seen by anne 
but she had staid at home under the mixed plea of a headache of her own and some return of indisposition in little charles 
she had thought only of avoiding captain pennyworth 
but an escape from being appealed to as expire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening 
as to captain wentworth’s views she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endanger the happiness of either sister or preaching his own honour than that he should prefer henrietta to louisa or louisa to henrietta 
either of them would in all probability make him an affectionate humoured wife 
with regard to charles haste she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman and a heart to |pgilrathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned 
but enrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings the alteration could not be understood too soon 
charles later had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin behaviour 
she had too old i regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguished every past hope and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from uppermost but there was such a change as became very alarming when such a man as captain pennyworth was to be regarded as the probable cause 
he had been ailment only two sundays and when they parted hid left her interested even to the height of his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy and obtaining runsussron 
7th that of uppermost instead 
it had then seemed the object nearest her hurt that dr shirked the rector who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office but was now growing too farm for many of them should be quite used an engaging a curate 
should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford and should give charles later the promise of it 
the advantage of his having to come only to uppermost instead of going six miles another war 
of his having in every cut a better curacy 
of his belonging to their dim shirked 
and of dear good dr shirked s being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue had been a great deal even to louisa but had been almost everything to henrietta 
when he came back all the zeal of the business was gone louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had held with dr sir she was at the window looking out for ca tame pennyworth 
and even henrietta had at best on ye a divided attention to live and seemed to have forgotten all the former on t and solicitude of the negotiation 
well i am very glad indeed 
but i always thought you would have it 
i always thought you sure 
it did not appear to me that 
in short you know dr shirked mud 
have a curate and you had secured his promise 
ii he coming louisa 
a one morning very soon after the dinner at the musgroves at which anne had not been present captain weutworth walked into the drawing-room it the cottage where were only herself and the little invalid charles who was lying on the sofa 
the surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliott deprived his manners of their usual composure he started and could only say a i thought the 8 masuasron 
miss grove had been here mrs grove told me i should send them here before he walked to the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behave 
they are upstairs with my sister they will be down in a few moments i dare say a had been anne's reply in all the confusion that was natural 
and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him she would have been out of the room the next moment and released captain wanton as well as herself 
he continued at the window 
and after calmly and politely saying a i hope the little boy is better 2 was silent 
she was obliged to kneel down by the sofa and remain then to satisfy her patient 
and thus they continued a few minutes when to her very great satisfaction she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule 
she hoped on turning her head to see the master of the house 
but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy 
charles hauteur probably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain lventworth than captain pennyworth had been by the sight of anne 
she only attempted to say how do you do 
will not you sit down 
the others will be here presently 
captain pennyworth however came from his window apparently not ill-disposed for conversation 
but charles hauteur soon put an end to his attempts by stating himself near the table and taking up the newspaper 
and captain pennyworth returned to his window 
another minute brought another addition 
the younger boy a remarkable stout forward child of two years old having got the door opened for him by some one without made his determined appearance among pluuuron’ 
8 them 
and went right to the care to see what wan going on and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away 
there being nothing to be eat he could only have some play 
and his aunt would not let him teazed brick brother he began to fasten itself upon her an the knelt in such a way that busy as the win about charles the could not make him ill she spoke to him ordered increased and insisted in vain 
once she did contrive to both him away but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly

come to could even 
but not a hit did alter it 
in another moment however she found herself in the state of being released from him 
name one was taking him from her 
though he had bent down her head to much that his little sturdy hand were unturned from around her neck and he was resolutely borne away before she knew that captain two had done it 
her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless 
she could not even thank him 
she could only hung over little three with most disordered feelings 
his kindness in slipping forward to her relief the manner the silence in which it had poured the little particular of the circumstance with the conviction noon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making wide the child that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks and rather sought to reality that her conversations wan the last of his wants produced such a 32 persuasion 
conditions of varying but agitation at her could not recover from till by the entrance of mary and the main approves to truth over her little patient to their cares and give the room 
she could not my 
it might have been an opportunity of watching the love and jealousies of the fair 
they were now altogether 
but the could any for none of it 
it was evident that claret hauteur was not well inclined towards captain “'cntworth 
she had a strong ii prevention of his having laid in a vast tone of voice after captain wentworth'l interference 1 you ought to have minded nun walker 
i told you not to tune or into 5 
and could comprehend hire n-gretu'ng that plea 
in pennyworth should do what he ought to have done himself 
but neither charles haytel’t feelings nor mybody’l feeling could interest her till he had a little better arranged her own 
she wan ashamed of lonely quite ashamed of being to fervour to overcome by such a trifle 
but to it war and it required a long application of solitude and reflections to recover her 
chutn5. their opportunities of making her observation could not fail to occur 
anne had noon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion though too wine to acknowledge at much at home 
where the knew it would have wliuﬁcd neithzrhmband nor wife 
for while the confidence loving to be rather the favourite he could not but think xl far at the might llll’l‘ to judge from memory and experience that captain pennyworth was not in love with either 
they were more in love with him 
yet there it war not love 
it won a little fever pnsmtsrorv 
8 of admiration 
but it might probably must end in love with some 
charles hauteur seemed aware of being lighted and yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them 
anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about and of pointing out some of the evila they were expecting tlienuclm to 
she did not 
attribute guile to any 
it war the highest satisfaction to her to believe captain wanton not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning 
there was no true he no pitiful triumph in by 
manner 
he had up by never heard and never thought of any claim of charles hauteur 
he only wrong in a thing the mentioned for accepting must be the word of two young women at once 
after a short struggle however charles hauteur seemed to quit the old 
three day had passed without his coming once to uppercrou 
a most decided change 
he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner 
and having been found on the occasion by mr grove with some large book 
before him mr and my grove were sure all could not be right and talked with grave faces of his studying himself to death 
it war mary ho and belief that he had received a positive minarﬁorn henrietta and her husband lived under the constant independence of seeing him to-morrow 
anne could only feel that charles hunger was wise 
one morning about this time charles curve and captain pennyworth being gone shooting together at the sister 
in the cottage were talking quietly at work they were waited at the window by the litter from the 
martina-house 
it wan a very line november day and the mill muagrovel came through the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to say that they were going 34 persuasion 
to take i long walk and therefore concluded mary could not like to go with them 
and when mary immediately lined with some beauty at not being suppose a g walker 1 oh yes 
i should like to join you very much i am very fond of a long walk 
a anne felt 
persuade by the look of the two girls that it was precisely what they did not wish and admired again the now of necessity which the family habit warned to produce of everything being to be communicated and everything being to be done together however undecided and inconvenient 
she tried to dissuade mary from going but in vain 
and that being the cave thought it beat to accept the main muegrovel much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise a she might be useful in turning back with her ill and lessening the interference in any plan of their own 
a i can not imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walk said mary an she went up in 
a everybody in any supposing that i am not a good walker 
and yet they would not have been please if we had refused to join them 
when people come in this manner on purpose to ask us how can one my no 2 
jump at they were letting off the gentleman returned 
they had taken out a young dog which had spoilt their sport and sent them back early 
their time and strength and irritate were therefore exactly ready for thin walk no they entered into it with pleasure 
could anne have foreseen week a junction the would have amid at home 
but from name feelings of interest and curiosity he fancied now that it war too late to retract and the whole six not forward together in the direction chosen b the miss mulgl'ovel who evidently considered the way it an under their guidance 
acres object was not to be in the way of an body 
and where the narrow path across the old made many nnsmtsxon 
3 relations necessary to with her brother and 3 
her plruu'ry in drink must arise from the exercise and the day from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the town leaves and withered hedges and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand political descriptions extent of autumn that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness that reason which has drawn from every poet worthy of being read some attempt at description or some lines of feeling 
she occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations 
but it was not possible that when within reach of captain pennyworth s conversation with either of the miss misgive she should not try to hear it 
yet she caught little very remarkable 
t was me live ye chat such as any young persons on an intimate footing might fall into 
e was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta 
louisa certainly it more forward for his notice than her sister 
this distinction appeared to increase and there was one speech of louisas which struck her 
after one of the man praises of the day which were continually bursting forth captain wentwortlt added 
what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister they meant to take i long drive this morning 
perhaps we may hailed them from some of these hills 
they talked of coming into this side of the country 
wonder whereabouts they will set today 
oh it does happen very often i assure you 
but my sister makes nothing of it 
she would as love be tossed out it not ah 
you make the most of it i know cried louisa 
but lit were really so i should do just the same in her place 
if i loved a man an she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever separate us and i would rather be returned by him than driven safely by anybody else 
3 szsuasrorr 
it wan porter with enthusiasm 
2 had you i 
cried he catching the lame tone 
i honour you 
2 and there wan silence between them for a little while 
anne could not immediately fall into a question again 
the sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by unless some tender bennet fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year with declining hasp negus and the images of youth and hope and ring all gone together 
blunted her memory 
she to herself to nay ll they struck by order into another that a ii not thin one of the way i to winter 
a gift nobody heard or at least nobody answered her 
winter however or it 
environs 
far young men are sometimes to be met with troubling about near home 
wan their destination 
and after another half mile of gradual ascend through large enclosure where the laugh at work and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteract the queen of poetry despondence and meaning to have spring again they gained the summit of the most considerable hill which parted upper and winter and noon commanded a full view of the latter at the not of the hill on the other side 
winter without beauty and without dignity stretched before them an indifferent house standing low and helped in by the bars and building of a farmer 
my mary exclaimed a much me 
here in winter 
i declare i had no idea 
well now i think we had better turn back 
i am excessively tired 
henrietta conscious and ashamed and feeling no cousin charles walking along any the or leaning against any gate war ready to do an new wished 
but no l a mad charles grove and no no i a cried louisa more eagerly and taking her finger aside mum 
to be arguing the matter warmly 
reasus’sron 
3 charles in the meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt now that he was so near 
and very evidently though more fearfully t age to induce his wife to go too 
but this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength 
and when he recommended the advantage cheating herself a quarter of an hour at winter as she felt so tired he resolutely answered a oh no indeed 
walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good 
and in short her look and manner declared that go she would not 
after a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations it was settled between charles and his two sisters that he and henrietta should run down for a few minutes to see their aunt and cousins while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill 
louisa seemed the principal stranger of the plan 
and as she went a pink way with them down the hill still talking to henrietta mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her and saying to caution pennyworth 
a it is very unpleasant having such connexion but i assure you i have never been in the house above twice in my life 
she received no other answer than an artificial assenting smile followed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which anne perfectly knew the meaning of 
the brow of the hill where the remained was a cheerful t louisa returned 
an mary lending a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a style was very well entitled so long as the others all stood about her 
but when louisa drew tupman pennyworth away to try for a leaving of cats in an adjoining hedgerow and the were gone by degrees quite out of right and sound henry was happy no longer she quarrelled with 38 rusmsxou 
her own seat was sure louisa got a much better somewhere and nothing could prevent her from going to look for at better also 
she turned through the name to but could not see them 
anne found a nice out it her on a dry fanny bank under the hedgerow in which the had no doubt of their fill being in time or other 
mary at down for a moment but it would not do 
the wan sure louisa had found a better treat nowhere else and the would go on till she overtook her 
anne really tired herself wan glad to sit down 
and he ve noon heard captain pennyworth and lounging in the m grown behind her an if making their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down the centre 
they were beating no they drew near 
i louion’t voice wan the list distinguished 
she learned to be in the middle of some eager speech 
what anne bent heard was 
and to i made her go 
i could not bear that the should be for hastened from the visit by such nonsense 
what 
would f be turned back from doing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right by the air and interference of such i person or of any person i my my 
no i have no idea of being i can persuade 
when i have made up my mind i have made it 
and henrietta deemed entirely to have made up hero to call at winter to-day 
and yet the was ll near giving it up out of nonsensical come laimncel a a she would have turned back then but 5 you 2 a a she would indeed 
i am almost alarmed to say in 
a happy for her to have such a mind at yourself at handy after the hints you give just now which lid but 
confirm my own observation the lost him 1 won in company with him i need not aspect to have no comprehending of what it going on 
i see that more than i msussron 
3 mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question 
and woe beside him and her too when it comes to things of consequence when they are placed in circumuaocesrequiring fortitude and strength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a thrive as this 
your sister is an amiable creature 
but your is the character of decision and darkness i see 
if you value her conduct or happiness confused as much of your own spirit into her as a can 
but this no doubt you have been always going 
it is the worst evil of too yielding and indecision a character that no influence over it can be depended on 
you are never sure of a good impression being durable 
everybody may say it 
let those who would be happy be arm 
here is a cut a said he catching one down from an upper brought to exemplary s beautiful glossy out which blessed with origin strength outlived all the storms of autumn 
not picture not a weak spot anywhere 
this but he continued with pale full so enmity a while so many of its return have far en and been trodden under foot is still in possession of all the heap unless that a blaze but can be supposed capable of hen returning to his former earnest tone 
a my first wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be arm 
if louisa grove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life she will cherish all her resent powers of mind 
e had done and was unanswered 
it would have surprised anne if louisa could have readily answered such i speech words of such interest spoken with such serious warmth 
she could imagine what louisa was feeling 
for herself she feared to move lest she should be seen 
while she remained a hush of low rambling holy protected her and the were moving on 
before they were 
beyond her hearing however louisa spoke again 
do reasussrou 
mary is good-natured enough in many respects said she 
a but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense and pride 
the idiot pride 
she has a great deal too much of the idiot pride 
we do so wish that charles had married anne instead 
i you know he wanted to marry anne e a later a moment s pause captain pennyworth said 
a do you mean that she refused him 
a job 
yes 
certainly 
when did that happen up 
i do not exactly know for henrietta and i were at school at the time 
but i believe about a year before he married ma 
i wish she had accepted him 
we should all have liked her a great deal better 
and papa and memory always think it 
was her great friend lady russell’s doing that she did not 
they think charles might not be learned and foolish enough topics lady swell and that therefore she persuaded anne to refuse him the sounds were retreating and anne distinguished no more 
her own emotions still kept her red 
she had much to recover from before she could move 
the listeners proverb fate was not absolutely hers she had heard no evil of herself but she had heard a great deal of very painful import 
she saw how her own chance was considered by captain pennyworth and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation 
as soon as she could she went after mary and have 
in found and walked back with her to their former station by the still felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected and once more in motion together 
her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give 
charles and henrietta returned bringing as may be 
hush 
a 9 i conjectured charles hated with them 
the minutiae of the main anne could not attempt to understand 
even captain pennyworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here 
but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman's tide and a relenting on the lady s and that they were now very glad to be together again did not admit a doubt 
henrietta looked a little ashamed burnt very well pleased 
— charles hauteur exceedingly happy end they were devoted to each other almost m the list instant of their all netting forward for uppercrou 
everything now marked out longing for captain pennyworth nothing could be plain 
and where many division were necessary 
or even where they were not they walked side by side nearly an much as the other two 
in a long of meadow land where there was ample grace for l 43 were undivided forming three distinct partial 
a to that party of the three which bounded lent animation and lean complaisance anne necessarily belonged 
she charge and mary and was tired enough to be very glad of charles other arm 
but charged though in very good humour with her wan out of temper with his wife 
mary had shown herself disobliging to him and was now to reap the con peace which consequence we hit drown her inn most every moment to cut evil the hen i of some cattle in the hedge with his witch 
and when mary began to complain of it and lament her being ill-used according to come in being on the hedge side while anne was never incommoded on the other he the m of both to hunt after a week which he had a momentary glance of and they could hardly get him alone it all 
the long meadow bar end a lane which their footpath at the end fit wan to cross and when the party and all reached the gate of exit 
the carriage advancing 6 9 rensussron 
in the same direction which had been some time heard was just coming up and proved in be admiral profits gig 
he and his wife had taken their intended drive and were returning home 
upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired 
it would have her full a mile and they were going through uppercrou 
the invitation was general and generally declined 
the miss muagmves were not at all tired and mary was either offended by not being asked before any of the others or what louisa called the idiot pride could not endure to make a third in a road-horse chaise 
the walking party had crossed the lane and were surmounting an opposite stale and the admiral was putting his horse into motion again when captain pennyworth cleared the hedge in a moment to any something to his sister 
the something might be guessed by its effects 
v amiss elliott i am sure you are tired cried on soft 
a do let us have the pleasure of taking you home 
here is excellent room for three i assure our 
if we were all like you i believe we might sit our 
you must indeed you must 
anne was still in the lane and though instinctively beginning to decline the was not allowed to proceed 
the admiral s kind urgency came in support of his wife s the would not be refused they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner and captain pennyworth without saying a word turned to her and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage 
yes 
he had done it 
she was in the carriage and felt that he had placed her there that his will and his hands had done it that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue made his resolution to give her rest 
she msuasrou 
3 wan very much affected v the view of his disposition towards her which all these thing made apparent 
thin little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before 
she understood him 
he could not forgive her but he could not be unfeeling 
though condemning her for the pack 
and considering it with high and unjust resentment though perfectly careless of her and though becoming attached to another still he could not see her earlier without the desire of giving her relief 
it wan a remainder of former sentiment 
it was an impulse of me though unacknowledged friendship 
it want a pool he own warm and amiable heart which she could not contemplate without emotions ago compounded of feature and pain that the knew not which prevailed 
her answer to the kindness and the remarks of her companion were at lit unconsciously given 
they had travelled half their way along the rough lane before the was quite awake to what they said 
she then found them talking of a frederick 1 he certainly mean to have one or other of than two girls sophia a rapid the admiral 
a but there in no laying which

and anne being engaged to join her noon at the was folded wan looking forward to room early removal to tell echo and beginning to think how her own comfort wan likely to be affected by it 
it would place her in the same village with captain pennyworth within half a mile of him 
they would have to frequent the nine church and there must be intercourse between the two families 
this was against her 
button the other hand he spent so much of persuasion 
as time at uppercron that in removing thence the might be considered rather an leaving him behind than a going towards him 
and upon the whole she believed the must on thin interesting question be the gainer almost an certainly a in her change of domestic society in leaving 5 mary for lady quell 
she wit it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing captain pennyworth at the hall those room had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her 
but the wan yet more anxious for the possibility of lady roll and ca train pennyworth never meeting anywhere 
they not like each other and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good and were lady roll to see them together she might think that he had too much belong and she too little 
these points formed her chicfwlicitude in anticipating her removal from upper where she felt he had been mentioned quite long enough 
her useful to little charles would always give some awectneulto the i memory of her two months visit there but he was gaining strength pace and the had nothing else to my or 
the conclusion of her visit however was diversion in a way which she had not at all imagined

the young people were all wild to lee lame 
captain unworthy talked of going there again himself it war only seventeen miles from uppercrou 
though november the weather war by no man had 
and in short louisa who war the most eager of the eager having formed the resolution to go and beside the pleasure of doing as she liked being new agreed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it on till summer 
nod to lane they were to go 
charles mary anne henrietta leaning and captain pennyworth 
the first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night 
but to this mr grove for the take of his home would not content 
and when it came to be rational considered a day in the middle of november would not leave much time for lacing a new place after educating seven hours as the nature of the country required for going and naming 
they were consequently to my the night there and not to be expected cook till the next day dinner 
this war felt to be a considerable amendment 
and though they all met at the great home at rather an early breakfast hour and net off very punctually it was so much part noon before the two carriages mr mutgrove‘a coach containing the four ladies and charles curricle in which he drove captain pennyworth were descending the long hill into lame and entering upon persuasion

captain pennyworth v turned in to call on his friend 
the mother walked on and he was to join them on the cook 
they were by no means tired of wondering and admiring 
and not even louisa leaned to feel that they had parted with captain pennyworth long when saw him coming after them with three companion l well known already by description m be captain and my horrible and a captain wick who was laying with them 
captain benwiclt had some time ago been lit lieutenant of the laconic 
and the account which c thin pennyworth had given of him on his return from lame before he warm prime of him an an excellent young man and an office 
whom he had always valued highly which must have me him well in the esteem of every dinner had been for owed by a little hurry of being private life which rendered him perfectly interfering in e eye of all the ladies 
he had been engaged to captain harville’a winter and we now mourning her love 
they had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion 
fortune came he prize 
mine an lieutenant being great 
promotion too came at no but fanny caviller did not live to know it 
she had died the preceding summer while he wan at tea 
captain pennyworth believed it impossible for man to be more nusuasron 
9 attached to woman than poor benwiclt had been to fanny caviller or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change 
he confined his disposition as of the sort which must answer heavily uniting very strong feelings with quiet serious and retiring manners and a decided taste for reading and sedentary ruin 
to finish the interest of the story the fricnd’e‘hip between him and the articles seemed if possible augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance and captain brunswick was now living with them entirely 
captain caviller had taken his present house for half a year 
his taste and his health and his fortune all directing him to a residence unexpensively and by the sea 
and the grandeur of the country and the retirement of lame in the winter appeared exact adapted to captain benwiclt’u name of mind 
the sympathy and good-will excited towards captain brunswick was very l 2 and yet a maid anne to herself as they now moved forward to meet the party he has not perhaps more sorrowing heart than i have 
i can not believe his property i delighted for ever 
he is younger than i am 
younger in feeling if not in fact 
younger as i man 
he will really again and be happy with another they all met and were introduced 
captain caviller wan a all dark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lame 
and from among features and want of health looking much older than captain pennyworth 
captain benwiclt looked and war the youngest of the three and compared with either of them a little man 
he had a leaning face and a melancholy air just at he ought to have and drew back from conversation 
captain caviller though not equally captain pennyworth in manners was a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging 
mrharville i degree roof persuasion 
lead polished than her husband earned however to have the lame good feelings and nothing could he more plums than their desire of considering the whole party no friend 
of their own became the friend of captain pennyworth or more kindly hospitable than their cntmtiee for their all promising to dine with them 
the dinner already ordered at the inn wan at last though unwillingly accepted an an excuse 
but they seemed almost hurt that captain pennyworth should have brought any such party to ye without considering it at a thing of course that they should dine with them 
there was to much attachment to captain pennyworth in all this and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality to uncommon 10 unlike the usual style of givevand-take invitations and sincere of formality and i lay that anne felt her spirit not likely to he bent by an increasing acquaintance among hue hrother-oiﬁeert 
there would have been all my friend wan her thought 
and the had to struggle against great tendency to town 
on quitting the cook they all went indoors with their new friends and found meant so usually are none but than who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating in many 
anne had a moment astonishment on the subject herself 
but it was noon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the night of all the in serious connivance and nice arrangement of captain village to turn the actual space to the but possible account to supply the deficiencies of lodging-home furniture and defend the window and door again the winter stem to he expected 
the variety in the fitting-up of the mere where the common necessaries divided by the owner in the common indifferent up right 
were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood excellently persuasion 
i or i worked up and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries captain caviller had visited were more than amusing to anne connected as it all was with his profession the fruit of its labours the effect of its influence on his habits the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented made it to her a something more or less than gratification 
captain caviller was no reader 
but he had contrived excellent accommodations and fashioned very pretty shelves for a tolerable collection of well-doing volumes the property of attain benwiclt 
his lateness prevented him torn go much exercise 
but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within 
he drew he finished he carpenters he glanced 
he made toys for the children 
he fashioned new netting-needles and pains with improvements and if everything else was done sat down to his large ﬁshing-net at one comer of the room 
anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house 
and his by whom she found herself walking burst forth into rapture admiration and delight on the character of the navy 
their friendliness their brotherliness their openness their uprightness 
protesting that she was convinced of sailors saving more worth and warmth than any other set of men in england 
that they only knew how to live and they only deserved to be respected and loved 
they went back to dress and dine 
and so well had the scheme answered already that nothing was found amiss 
though its being a so entirely out of the season and the 4 no thoroughfure of fame and the 4 no expectation of corn any had brought many apologies from the heads of inn 
anne found herself by this time owing so much more hardened to being in captain \gentworth’s comic 2 persuasion 
pony than the had at lit imagined could ever be that the sitting down to the tame table with him now and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it they never got beyond what become a mere nothing 
he nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow but captain sackville had promised them a visit in the evening 
and he came banging his friend also which was more than had been expected it having been agreed that captain brunswick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the pretence of to many strangers 
he ventured among them again however though hit spirit certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the part in general 
while captain north and horrible led the talk on one ride of the room and by recurring to former day supplied anecdotes in abundance to occur ye and entertain the others it fell to anne's lot to placed rather apart with captain llcnwick 
and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him 
he was thy and disposed to abstraction 
but the edge g mildness of her countenance and gentleness of her manner moon had their effect 
and anne was well repaid the art trouble of exertion 
he was evidently a young man of considerable tune in reading though principally in poetry 
and besides the sensation of having given him at least an evening indulgence in the discussion of subjects which his usual companion had probably no concern in the had the hope of being of real use to him in some rug getting at to the duty and benefit of struggling against affection which had naturally grown out of their conversation 
for though shy he did not seem referred it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to hurt their usual restraint 
and having talked of poetry the richer of the present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the ﬁrttrrate poem trying humour 
of ascertain whether rational tbeladyqflbelah were to be preferred and how ranked the glass and the bride of 15th and moreover how the gl'aaur was to be pronounced he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other 
he repeated with such tremulous feeding the various lines which imagined a broken heart or a a mind destroyed by wretchedness and looked so surely as if he meant to he understood that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry and to say that the thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely 
and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but speakingly 
his looks showing him not pained hurt pleased with this allusion to his situation she was embody end to go on 
and feeling in herself the right 
of seniority of mind she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study 
and on being requested to pnmculatizc mentioned such works of our best morality such collections of the nest letters much memoirs of cluster of worth and suffering as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest process and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurance 
captain bcnwiclr listened attentively and seemed grate us for the interest implied 
and thou he with a shake of the head and sighs which delay his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his noted down the names of those she recommended and promised to procure and read them 
when the evening was over anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to ye to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had my summon 
evergreen before 
mromlddtehelpfaﬁnbonmore serious reflection that like man other great moral and reached the had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill hear examination 
than 13 
one and henrietta ending themselves the darling of the party the next morning agreed to mull down to the tea before breakfast 
they went to the end to watch the knowing of the tide which i line south-westerly breeze wan bringing in with all the grandeur which is at a horse admitted 
they pulled the morning 
lord in the tea 
sympathised in the delay hat of the fresh-feeling breeze 
and were silent 
till enrietta suddenly began again with 
oh well i am quite convinced that with very few exceptions the leader always duel good 
there can be no doubt of in having been of the greatest service to dr shirt after allall illness last spring twelvemonth 
he do am himself that coming to lane for a month did him more good than all the medicine he took 
and that being by the leaf always make him feel young again 
now i can not help thinking it a pity that he do not live entirely by the tea 
i do think he had better leave uppercroa entirely and ix at lame 
do not you anne 
do not you agree with me that it in the hen thing he could do both for himself and my shirked 
she has cousin here you know and many acquaintance which would make it cheerful or her and i am sure the would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand in case of his having another seizure indeed i think it quite melancholy to have much excellent a 
a al.1414915 mum 
mtnsussron 
for people as dr and mrs shirked who have been doing good all their lives wearing out their last days in a place like uppermost where excepting our family they seem shut out from all the world 
i wish his friends would propose it to him 
i really think they ought 
and as to procuring a sensation there could be no difficulty at his time of life and with his character 
my only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish 
he is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions 
over-scrupulous must say 
do not you think anne it is being over-scrupulous 
do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties which may be as well performed by another mean 
and at ye too only seventeen miles of he would be near enough to hear if people thought there was anything to complain of anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech and entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man though here it was good of a lower standard for what could be altered but general acquiescence 
she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business 
felt the claims of dr sharply to repose as she ought 
saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man as a resident curate and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate being married 
i wish said henrietta very well pleased with her companion 1 i wish lady cassel lived at 
uppermost and were intimate with dr shirked 
i have always heard of lady cassel as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody i always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything 
i am afraid of her as i told you before quite afraid of for pain 
lumber-jule the ii an veryclever 
but i respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbour at a reproof 
no war amused by henrietta’t manner of being grateful and amused also that the courage of events and the new interest of henrietta’a viewed should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the misgive found 
3 the had only time however for a general answer an a wish that each another woman were at uppercroeg before all object suddenly ceased on seeing loving and captain pennyworth coming toward them 
they came aloof for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready 
but louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that the had something to procure at a shop invited them all to go hack with her into the town 
the were all at her hen they name to the steps leading ward from the back a gentleman at the more moment preparing to come down politely drew hack and stopped to give them way 
they amended and planned him 
and no they parted anne face caught his eye and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration which the could not be insensible of 
she war looking remarkably well 
her very regular ve rest featured having the bloom and fro-linear of yoiiytlrp restored by the line wind which had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of eye which it had also produced 
it was evident that the gentleman corn letter a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly 
pain pennyworth loo round at her intently in a way which showed his noticing of it 
he gave her a moment glance a glance of brightness which seemed to ray a hat man in much with you and even i at thin moment see something like anne elliott again after attending louisa through her guineas and loitering about a little longer they returned to the inn 
persuasion 
i on end anne in paling afterward quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room had nearly run against the very name gentleman no he came out of rejoicing upurtvnent 
she had before conjectured him to be a manager like themselves and determined that a well-looking groom who was troubling about near the two in a they came back should be his servant 
both master and man being in mourning filled the idea 
it was now proved that he belonged to the same inn themselves 
and thin second meeting about it wan ho proved against by the gendelnan'e lock that he thought her very lovely and by the refined and propriety of his apologies that he wan us m of exceedingly good manners 
he learned about thirty and though not lmndnomc had an agreeable potions 
anne felt that the should like to know who he was 
they had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage almost the list they had heard since entering lame drew half the party to the window 
it we 
a gendcman’l carriage i uncle 
but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door 
somebody must be in away 
it wan driven by a servant in mourning 
he word curricle made charles grove jump up that he might compare it with his own 
the tenant in mourning roused anne's curiosity and the whole six were collected to look by the time the owner of the uncle was to he been issuing from the door under the bow and civility of the household and taking his seat to drive of 
ah 
a cried captain pennyworth instantly and with half a balance it anne 1 it in the very man we i g i 1 the mind mulgrovel agreed to it

depend upon it that ll i circumstance which all servant rate care to public wherever he go 
but anne only conceive how extraordinary 
i with i had looked at him more 
i with we had been aware in time who it war that he might have been introduced to us 
what a pity that we should not have been introduced in each other i do you think he had the idiot countenance 
i hardly looked at him

if the servant had not been in forming one should have known him by the livery 
a putting all these ve extraordinary circumstances together a said captain “yentworth 
we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin 
when she could command ma s attention anne quietly tried to convince her that 5 father and mr elliott had not for man years been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable 
at the same time however it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good sense 
she would not upon any account mention her having met with him the second time 
luckily mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their early walk but she would have felt quite ill-used by anne 3 having actually ran against him in the passage and received his very polite excuses while she had never been near him at all 
no that cousin little interview must remain a perfect secret 
of course said ma 1 you will mention our seeing mr elliott the next time you write to bath 
i think my father certainly ought to hear of it 
do mention all about him 
anne avoided a direct reply but it was just the circumstance which she considered at not merely unnecessary to be communicated but as what ought to be suppressed 
the offence which had been given her father many years back she knew 
eliubeth’s particular share in it she instructed 
and that mr elliott idea always produced irritation in both wan beyond a doubt 
mary never wrote to bath herself 
all the toil l i of persuasion 
of go up a cloth and unlatiaﬁcmry coneqondmce with elizabeth fell on anne 
breakfast had not been long over what they were joined by captain and mr horrible and captain brunswick 
with whom they had appointed to take their tax walk about lame 
they ought to be netting at 
for uppercroubyone and in the mean whilewere to be all together and out of door 
an long at they could 
anne found captain brunswick getting near her at noon at they were all fairly in the meet 
their conversation the preceding evening did not incline him to seek her again 
and the walked together some time talking at before of mr it and lord brown and mill at unable at before and a unable as any other two ready to think exactly alike of the merit of either till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their city and instead of captain brunswick she had chagrin servile by her ride

no danger of her being lent to lea-again 
he took his chance for the rest 
wrote up for love of absence but without waiting the return travelled night and day till he got to portsmouth owed of to the power that instant and never left the poor fellow for a week 
that if what he did and nobody else could have saved poor james 
you may think mien elliott whether he in dear to us i a anne did think on the question with perfect decision and laid as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish or in his seemed able to bear for he was too much affected to renew the subject and when he 1 polite again it way of something totally different 
a horrible s giving it at her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home determined the direction of all the party in what vain to be their last walk 
they would become my them to their door and then mr and set a themselves 
13 all their calculations there war not time for this 
but no they drew near the cook there was inch a general with to walk along it once more all were of inclined and love noon grew so determined that the difference of a quarter of an hour it was found would he no difference at all 
to with all the kind leave-taking and all the kind interchange of invitation and promise which may be imagined they beamed from captain and my caviller at their own not and still accompanied by captain brunswick who seemed to cling them to the last proceeded to make the proof err adieu to the cook

a bed on the door in loving room would be sufficient for her if my caviller would but think no 
one thing more and all seemed arranged 
though it wan rather delicate that mr and my mule should be previously alarmed by name than of delay 
yet the time hired by the ppercrou home to take them hack wo d be a dreadful extent of expense 
and captain pennyworth proposed and charles reprove agreed that it would be much better for him to take a chain from the inn and leave mr mulgrove'n carriage and honor to he tent home the next morning early when there could he the farther advantage of ten in an account of louisa night 
captain pennyworth now hurried toil forgot everything ready on his part and to he soon followed by the two ladies 
when the plan wan made known to mary however there wan an end of all peace in it 
she wan lot wretched and no vehemently complained to much of injustice in being expected to go awnyinetcad of anne anne who wan nothing to social while she was her later and had the bent right to nay in henrietta’t tread

and to home without charles too without her husband on it wan too unkind 
and in short uh..uaid more than her head could long withstand and ii none of the mother could open when he gave way there war no help for it the c age of mary for anne wan inevitable 
anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the parlour and ill-judging clear of mary 
but no it fun he and they act 3 for the town charles taking care of hit litter and captain brunswick attending to her 
she gave a moment recollection at they hurried along to the little circumstances which the name spot had persuasion 
1 19 witnessed earlier in the morning 
there she had listened to heurietta’s schemes for dr shirley’s leaving uppermost 
further on she had first seen mr elliott 
a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but louisa or those who were wrapped up in her welfare 
captain brunswick was most considerate attentive to her 
and united as they all seemed by the distress of the day she felt an increasing degree of good 
will towards him and a pleasure even in thinking that it might perhaps he the occasion of continuing their distance 
no pennyworth was on the watch for them and a chance and four in waiting stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street 
but his evident 
surprise and vexation at the substitute of one sister for the other the change of his countenance the astonishment the e passions begun and suppressed with which charles was tended to made but a mortifying reception of anne 
or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to louisa 
she endeavoured to be composed and to be just 
without relating the feelings of an emma towards her henry she would have attended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard for his take 
and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to for she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend 
in the mean while she was in the carriage 
he had handed them both in and placed himself between them 
and in this manner under these circumstances full of astonishment and emotion to anne she quitted lame 
how the long stage would pass 
how it was to dick their manners 
what was to be their sort of intercourse she could not foresee 
it was all quite natural however 
he was devoted to henrietta 
always turning i 20 persuasion 
toward 
her 
end when he spoke at all always with the view of supporting her ho and rain her ride 
in general his voice and mhn’edner vice inglioutlyﬂlm 
to spare henrietta from agitation adorned the governing principle 
once only when the had been grieving over the last ill-judged ill-fated walk to the sob bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of he but forth at if wholly overcome 
a do n't talk of it don't talk of it a hurried 
a oh god 
that i had not given way to her at the fatal moment 
had i done an i ought 
but to eager and so resolute dear sweet locks i 
anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now to question the of hit own previous opinion an to the universal felicity and advantage of renew of character 
and whether it might not strike him that like all other realities of the mind it should have its proportion and limits 
she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometime be as much in favour of happiness an a very resolute character 
they got on fat 
anne wo astonished to recognized the lame hills and the name object to noon 
their actual speed heights by one dread of the confusion made the road appear but half a long an on the day before 
it was growing quite dusk however before they were in the neighbourhood of uppercrou and there had been total silence among them for some time henrietta leaning back in the corner with a shawl over her face giving the hope of her having cried herself to deep 
when in they were going their last hill anne found herself all at once addicted by captain wentwimh 
in low curtain voice he said

she could not stand it 
i have been thinking whether you had not better reunion persuasion

do you think thin a good in it up she did he wan satisfied and said no more 
but the remembrance of the i remained a pleasure to her as a proof of friendship and of deference for her judgment 3 great pleasure 
and when it became a sort of king proof in value did not even 
hen the lingering communication at uppercrou was over and he had new the father and mother write as comic a could he hoped and the daughter as the better or being with them he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to ye 
and when the house were waited he war william 33 
be remainder of angel time at uppercron comprehending only two days war spent en 
truly at the union home 3 and ill had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there both an an immediate companion and a sitting in all than arrangement for the future which in mr and my muegrove’u distressed note of spirit would have been difficulties 
they had an early account from ye the next morning 
louisa wan much the same 
no symptom wore than before had appeared 
charles came a few hour afterwards to bring a later and more particular account 
he was tolerably cheerful 
a speedy cure must not be ho but everything was going on ill well ii the nature of the clue admitted

she really left nothing for mary to do 
he and mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn at no hat 
mary had been hysterical again this morning 
hen he came away the me going to walk out with captain brick which he he would do her good 
he almost with the had prevailed on to come home the day before 
but the truth wet that mrs caviller left nothing for anybody to do 
charles wan to return to l me the tame afternoon and hit father had at lit half a mind to with him but the ladies could not content 
it wo d be going only to multiplied trouble to the others and invite hit own bitterest 
and a much better there followed and wan acted upon 
a chair was tent for from crewkheme and charge conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maids of the family one who having brought up all the children and then the very last the line evening and loug-petted matter harry tent to tell at 
a hit brother wan now living in her deterred nursery to mend ttocltingt and drew all the faint and butter the could get near her and who consequently was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear mist louisa 
vague wishes of getting sarah thither had occurred before to mrs grove and henrietta 
but without anne it would hardly have been resolved on and found practicable to noon 
they were indebted the next do to charge later for all the minute knowledge of out which it was to essential to obtain every twenty-four heart 
he made it hit business to go to lane and hit account was still encouraging 
the interval of tents and conscience were believed to be wronged 
every report agreed in captain wentworth't appearing mixed in lame 
anne want to leave them on the morrow an event which they all dreaded 
a what should they do without her 
they were wretched comforter for one persuasion 
i 23 other 
and so much was said in thin way that anne thought the could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which the wan privy and persuade them all to go to lane at once 
she had little difficulty 
it was soon determined that they would go go to-morrow ix tlrcmnelvcn at the inn or get into lord gay as it united and then remain till dear louisa con d be moved 
they neat be taking off tom trouble from the and if the war with they might at least relieve me home from the care of her own children and in short they were so happy in the decision that anne wan delighted with what the had done and felt that she could not spend her lamp morning at uppercrou better than in assisting their preparations and sending them of 
at an early hour though her being left to the solitary range of the house wan the consequence 
she wan the last expect ring the little boys at the cottage the was the vary at the only remaining one of all that had killed and animated both houses of all that had given uppercrou its cheerful character 
a few day 
had made a change indeed 
if louisa recovered it would all be well again 
more than former happiness would be restored 
there could not be i on t to her mind there we none of what would follow her recovery 
a few month hence and the room now so deserted occupied but by her silent 
pensive all i hit be called again with all that was happy and gay all that won glowing and bright in rlolgperl'oul love all that was most unlike anne not an hour come late leisure for such rejection at those on i dark li‘lovemher day i small thick rain allusion blowing out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the window was enough to make the sound of lady ruuell’a carriage exceedingly welcome 
l 24 msunsrou 
and thou he desirous to be gone the could not quit the union cut or look on adieu to the cottage wide its black dripping and eomfonleu herand or even notice through the mighty glance the man humble refinement of the village without a saddened heart 
someone had paced in supper which made it precious 
it modes the records of many lenntiooe of pain once severe but now softened 
and of some instance of relenting feeling borne breathing of friendship and reconciliation which could never be looked for again and which could never ensue to he dear 
she left it all behind her all but the recollection that such things had been 
anne had never entered kill c since her quitting lady ruuell'a house in september 
it had not been necessary and the few ocouiona of its being points for her to go to the hall ll 
had contrived to evade and escape from 
her lift return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartment of the lodge and to added the eyes of in more 
there wan some anxiety mixed with lad runell'l joy in meeting her 
she knew who had been requesting uppercron 
but happily either anne wan improved in plump and looks or lady quell fancied her to 
and anne 
in receiving her compliments on the occasion had the agreement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin and of hoping that he was to be pleased with a second spring of youth and lay 
hen they came to convey the wan noon sensible of lame mental change 
the subject of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch and which the had felt alighted and been compelled to another among the mulgroveu were now become but of secondary intreat 
she had lately lord right even of her father and finer and bath 
their concerns had been sunk under pmussrow 
a 5 those of uppermost 
and when lady cassel reverted to their former hopes and fears and spoke her satisfaction in the house in came place which had been taken and regret that mrs clay should still be with them anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of fame and louisa grove and all her acquaintance there 
how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the articles and captain brunswick than her own father s house in came place or her own sister's intimacy with mrs clay 
she was actually forced to exert herself to meet lady swell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude on topics which had by nature the first claim on her 
there was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject 
they must act of the accident at 
ye 
lady rose had not a arrived ve minutes the day before when a full account of the whole had burst on her 
but still it must be talked of she must make enquiries she must regret the import 
hence lament the result and captain wentworth’s name must be mentioned by both 
anne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady cassel 
she could not speak the name and look straight forward to lady russell’s e e till she had adopted the expedient of telling her bride what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa 
when this was told his name distressed her no longer 
lady spell had only to listen composedly and wish them happy but internally her heart revealed in angry pleasure in teased contempt that the man who at twenty-three ha seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an anne elliott should eight years afterwards be charmed by a louisa grove 
the list three or four days passed most quietly with no circumstance to mark them exciting the real 36 persuasion 
receipt of a note or two from lane which found their way to anne the could not tell how 
and thought rather improving account of learning 
at the 
end of that period lady runell'a politeness could repose no longer and the fainter cell-threatening of the st became in a decided tone i must call on mrs rent 
i really innate call upon her soon 
anne have you cough e to go with meand pay a visit in that house 
it i be some trial to no brother anne did not shrink from it on the contrary the lonely felt no the laid in observing 
a i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two 
your feelings are lest reconciled to the change than mine 
by remaining in the neighbourhood i am become inured to it she could have said more on the subject for she had in fact so high an opinion of the carts and considered her father to very fortunate in hit tenants felt the parish to he to lustre of a good example and the poor of the best mention and relief that however in 
and ashamed for the necessity of the removal the you d not but in conscience feel that they were one who deserved not to stay and that kellynch hat had passed into better hand than its owners 
these convictions must unquestionably have their own pain and never war it kind 
but they procured that pain which lady vessel would alter in entering the house again and returning through the well-known apartments 
in such moments anne had no power of saying to herself 
these rooms ought to belong only to us 
oh how fallen in their destination 
how unworthily occupied an ancient family to he so driven away 
strangers felling their place 
a no except when the thought of her mother and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside she had no sigh of that description to have 
persuasion 
l 21 mrs profit always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite and on the present occasion receiving her in that house there via-lparticular attention 
the accident at lane was soon the prevailing topic and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yettennom 
that captain pennyworth had been in kellyncll yesterday the list time since the accident had brought anne the last note which the had not been able to trace the exact steps of 
had staid a cow hourly d thenretumedagainto lame and without any present intention of quitting it any more 
he had enquired after her she found particularly 
had ox rested his hope of ice elliott not being the worse 
far her ceremony and had spoken of there exertions as great 
this was handsome and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done 
as to the sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of my sensible women whose judgments had to work on ascertained events 
and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtfulness and much imprudence 
t is effect were most alarming and that it wan frightful to think how on mine nfusgrove s recover might yet he doubtful an how liable she would nail remain to out 
a from the caucus-ion hereafter 
the admiral wound it all up rumination by exclaiming 
a ay a very bad boldness indeed 
a new sort of way thin for a young fellow to be making love by breaking hit mistrcae’e head is not it miss elliott 
this in breaking a head and giving a lantern truly 
admiral crot't’u manners were not quite of the tone to suit lad cassel but the delighted anne 
his fondness old heart and simplicity of characters were irresistible 
3 persuasion 
now thin must be very bad for you laid lie suddenly rousing from a little reverie to be coming and ii in us here 
i had not recollected it before i declare but it 
must be very bad 
but now do not and upon ceremony 
get up and go over all the rooms in the home if you like it 
a another time sir i thank you 
not now a a well whenever it wit you 
you can lip in from the shrubbery at any time 
and there you will and we keep our umbrella in up by that door 
a good place in not it 
but a checking herself you will not think it a good place 
for your were always kept in the battle 
room 
ay no it always ll i believe 
one means way 
may be at good a incl-her’l but we all like our own bolt 
and no you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for you to go about the home or not 5 anne mending the might decline it did it very grave e we have made very few changes either continued the admin-4| after thinking a moment 
very few 
we told you about the laundry-door at uppercrou 
that has been a very great improvement 
the wonder wan how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of it opening an it did it long 
you will tell sir alter what we have done and that mr shepherd thinking the greatest improvement the house ever had 
indeed i most do ourselves the justice to any that the few alteration 
we have made have been all very much for the better 
my wife should have the credit of them however 
i have done very little besides tending away game of the large looking-glam from my dmaing-mom which was your father 
a very good man and very much the gentlemen i am sure 
but i should think mix elliott 
looking with serious reflection i should think he must be rather i nusunsrorw 
2 drury man for his time of life 
such a number of looking-glam 
oh lord 
there was no getting am from one half 
so i got sorry to lend me a band and we noon shifted their quarters 
and now i am quite snug with my little shaving-glain one corner and another great thing that i never go near anne aroused in spite herself wan rather disagreed for an answer 
and the admiral fearing he might not have been civil enough took up the object again to m v the next time you write to your good father mix elliott pray give my compliments and mr 
cross and that we are settled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to and with the lace 
the breakfast-room chimney makes a little grant on but it in only when the wind ll due north and bowing hard which may not happen three time 
a winter 
and take it altogether now that we have been into coat of the bonnet hereabouts and an judge there in not one that we like better than this 
pray say no with my compliments 
he will be glad to hear it 
lady renewal and mrcroft were very well pleased with each other but the acquaintance which the visit began was fated not to proceed far at relent 
for when it will returned the grass announced themselves to he going away for a few weeks to visit their connexion in the north of the county and probably might not be at home again before lady well would be removing to bath 
so ended all danger to anne of meeting captain pennyworth at kellynch hall or of seeing him in comes 
party with her friend 
everything was safe enough and he failed overthrew many anxious feeling the had wanted on the subject 
3 persuasion 
chapter 37 
though chaplain ma had remained at lame much longer after 5 and my muegrove'l going than anne conceived they could have been at all wanted they were yet the list of the family to be at home again 
and at noon at possible after their return to a promote they drove over to the lodge 
they had let r. louisa be owning to lit up 
but her had though clear wan excel singly weak and her nerve perceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness 
and though ill might be renounced to be altogether doing very well it wan nail impossible to say when the might be able to hear the removal home 
and her father and mother who must return in time to receive their younger children for the chimney holiday had hardly a ha of being allowed to bring her with them 
they ha been all in lodgings together 
mrs misgive had got mrs harvillc’r children away i much as the could every possible supply from uppercrou had been finished to lie ten the inconvenience to the caviller while the articles had been wanting them to come to dinner every day 
and in hurt it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side at to which should be most disinterested and horrible 
mary had had her evil but upon the whole as wan evident by her staying so long she had found more to enjoy than to taller 
charlehayter had been at l me oftener than invited her 
and when they dined with the caviller there had been only a maidservant to wait and at first mrs sackville had always given me grove precedent 
but then the had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out where daughter the was and there had been so much going on every day there had been no many walkmuseum 
1 
between their lodgings and the articles and she had got books from the library and changed them so often that the balance had certainly been much in favour of ye 
she had been taken to chariot too and she had bathed and she had gone to church and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at lame than at uppermost 
and all this joined to the sense of being so very useful had made really an agreeable fortnight 
anne in tired after captain brunswick 
mary s face was clouded directly 
charles laughed 
oh 
captain envied is very well i believe but he is a very odd young man 
i do not know what he would be at 
we asked him in come home with meal for a day or two charles undertook to ve him come shooting and he seemed quite delight and for my part i thought it was all settled when behold on tuesday night he made a very awkward sort of an excuse 
he never shot a and he had been quite milundemood 2 and he had promised this and he had promised that and the end of it was i found that he did not mean to come 
i sup so he was afraid of sending it dull 
but upon my wo i should have though 
we were lively enough at the cottage for such a heartbroken man as ca train benwick.’ charles laugh again and said now ma you know very well how it really was 
it was all your doing a turning to anne 
e fancied that if he went with us he should and out close by he fancied everybody to be living in ppercross 
and when he discovered that lady cassel lived three mile of his heart failed him and he had not courage to come 
that is the fact upon my honour 
mary knows it is but mary did not give into it very graciously whether from not considering captain brunswick entitled by birth and situation to begin love with an idiot or from not want 32 persuasion 
in 
to believe anne a greater attraction to uppercrou than benefit man be left to be guessed 
angel goodwill however war not to be returned by what he heard 
she boldly acknowledged himself uttered and conducted her idea 
oh he all of you cried charles in arch term 
mary interrupted him 
i declare charles i never heard him mention anne twice all the time wan there 
i declare anne he never talk of you at all 
a no admitted charge a i do not know that he ever does in a general way 
but however it in a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly 
his head in full of come book that he in reading upon your recommendation and he wants to talk to you about them 
he he found out something or other in one of them which he thinks 
oh 
i can not pretend to remember it but it up something very one 
i overheard him telling henrietta all about it 
and then a nice elliott was spoken of in the highest formal now mary i declare it was to i heard it myself 
and you were in the other room 
a et once sweetness beauty oh 
there war no end of in elliott charm 
and i am sure cried mary warmly it was very little to his credit if he did 
miss caviller only died last june 
such a heart it very little worth having in it lady quell 
i am cure you will agree with me 
a i men are coming brunswick before i decide laid lady unwell am my 
2 and that you are very likely to do very noon i can tell you ma'am laid charles 
a though he had not never for coming away with m and setting off again afterwards to ye a formal visit here 
he will make his way over to ellynch one day by herself you ma depend on it 
i told him the distance and the road 
persuasion 
i 33 and i told him of the church s being so very well worth seeing 
for an he has a taste for those sort of things i thou hit that would be a good excuse and he listened with l hire demanding and soul 
and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here poor 
so i give you notice lady quell 
a any acquaintance of anyone will be always welcome to me a wan lady ruuell’l kind answer 
a oh i an to being anna acquaintance a said mary 1 i think he it rather my acquaintance for i have been seen him every day thin last fortnight 
a well as your 
aim acquaintance then i shall be very happy to see pain brunswick 
a you will not and anything ve agreeable in him i nature you ma'am 
he in one of the dullest young men that ever lived 
he hung walked with me sometimes from one end of the and w the other without saying a word 
he in not at all a well-bred young man 
i am sure you will not like him 
a there we differ mary laid anne 
i think lady recall would like him 
i think the would be no much pleased with his mind that she would very noon see no deficiency in his manners a so do i anne laid charles 
i am sure lady vessel would like him 
he in june lady cassel s tart 
give him a book and he will read all day long 
yes 
that he will i a replied mary doubtingly 
a he will sit poring over his book and not know when a person speak 
to him or when one drop 
one lesson or anything that happens 
do you think lady well would like that i 
lady cassel could not help laughing 
a upon my word said she 
i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such differ 
once of conjecture needs and matter of fact at i may 34 persuasion 
call myself 
have really ourioitytonee the person who can give union to inch directly opposing notion 
l with he may be indncodlo all here 
and when he does mary you may depend hearing my opinion hulamdeteminednotlojdehimbeforehand.’ 1 you will not like him 
i will answer for it 
lady quell began talking of something clue 
mary spoke with animation of their meeting with or rather minding mr allied to extraordinary 
he in a man mild lady unwell 1 whom i have no wish to lee 
he declining to he on cordial term with the head of his family had left a very rung impressions in his disfavour with me 
this decision checked may eagerness and named her hot in the mind of the lot countenance 
with regard to captain pennyworth though anne hazarded no inquiries there was voluntary communication sufficient 
his spirit had been greatly recovering lately i might be expected 
a louisa improved he had improved and he wan now nice a different cream from what he had been the 1 week 
he had not seen louisa 
and was an extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview that he did not prey for it at all 
and on the contrary seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days till her head was stronger 
he had talked of going down to plymouth for a week and wanted to nurse captain bending to go with him 
but an hamlet maintained to the man 
captain brunswick leaned much more disposed to ride over to kellynch 
there can be no doubt that lad swell and anne were both occasionally thinking of captain brunswick from thin time 
lady cassel could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be hit herand 
nor could anne return from any stroll of military inplnsnssxon 
3 silence in her father s grounds or any visit of charity in the village without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him 
ca rain brunswick came not however 
he was either cup disposed for it than charles had imagined or he was too shy 
and after giving him a week's indulgence lady cassel determined him to he unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite 
the mud moves came back to receive their ha my boys and from school bringing with them as hsrville’s little children to improve the noise of uppermost and lessen that of ye 
enrich remained with louisa but all the rest of the family were again in their union garters 
lady cassel an anne hid their compliments to them once when anne julia not but feel that uppermost was already quite alive again 
though neither henrietta nor louisa nor charles hauteur nor captain pennyworth were there the room presented as strong a contrast as could he wished to the last state she had seen it in 
immediately surrounding mrs musgroee were the little hnrvillcs whom she was sedulously guarding from the by an of the two children from the cottage expressly to amuse them 
on one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls cutting up silk and gold per 
and on the other were dressed and trash hen g under the weight of brown and cold pigs where riotous boys were holding high reel 
the whole completed by a raving christmas which seemed determined to he heard in spite of all the noise of the others 
charles and mary also came in of course during their visit and mr grove made a point of paying his respects to lady swell and sat down close to her for ten minutes talking with i very raised voice but from the colour of the children on his try persuasion 
knees generally in vain 
it was 
a one familyanne judging from her own experiment would have deemed such a doze curricle a had restorative of the nerve which louisa illness must have it gently shaken 
but my mule who got anne near her on purpose to thank her foot cordially again and again for all her attention to them concluded a short recapitulan'oo of what the had suffered herself by opening with a happy glance round the room that after all the had gone through nothing wan to likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home 
louisa wan now recovering space 
her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home before her brother and deter 
wept to school again 
the caviller had promised to come with her and ray at uppercrou whenever the returned 
captain pennyworth wan gone for the present to are his brother in shropshire 
31 hope i shall remember in future laid lady quell ll soon at the were reflected in the carriage not to call at ppercroel in the chriunuu he day.i everybody has their taste in noise as well up in other matters 
and sounds are quite innnxiom or most distressing 
by their tart rather than their sunday 
when lady rum not long afterwards was entering bath on a wet afternoon and driving through the long court of meet from the old bridge to condemn place amid the duke of other carriage the heavy ramble of calm and day the barking of news mufﬁn-men and milk and the cutlets cloak of pattern who made no complaint 
no then were notice which belonged to the winter posture 
her spirit rate under their influence 
and like mrs grove he was feeling though not crying that after being long in the rusmsron 
31 crown a couldheao forherualittle my mind 34 anne did not there these feelings 
she a in a very determined though very silent define invitation for bath 
caught the hat dim view of the extensive buildings making in mind without any wish of seeing them better 
felt their progress through the meet to be however disagreeable yet too rapid 
for who would be glad to lee her when he arrived 
and looked back with fond regret to the garden of uppercrou and the delusion of kellynch 
elizabeth last letter had communicated a piece of new of some interest 
mr elliott war in bath 
he had called in came place 
had called a second time i third 
had been pointedly attentive 
if elizabeth and her father did not deceive them-clue had been taking an much pain to seek the acquaintance and proclaim the value of the connection at he had formerly taken paint to show neglect 
thin was very wonderful if it were true 
and lady cassel was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about mr elliott already recalling the sentiment he had no lately expressed to ma of tall being a man whom she had no with to ice 
a she had a great with to see him 
if he really caught to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he must he for even for having remembered himself from the poem tree 
anne wan not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance but the felt that she would rather see mr elliott again than not which was more than she could any for many other persons in bath 
she wan put down in came place and lady well then drove to her own lodgings in river street 
run 
persuasion 
chapter 17 
in water had taken a we good hour in came place a lofty dignity situation much ll becomes a man of consequence 
and both he and elizabeth were settled there much to their satisfaction 
anne endured it with a sinking heart anticipating an imprinnrnent of many months and anxious saying to herself for 
when shall i leave you again 
a degree of unexpected cordiality however in the welcome the received did her good 
her father and deter were glad to see her for the sake of showing her the home and ﬁimiturc and met her with kindness 
her making a fourth when they sat down to dinner was noticed a an advantage 
my clay wan v pleasant and very smiling but her courtesies and until as were more a matter of course 
anne had any felt that the would pretend what wan proper on her arrival but the complaining of the other was unlocked for 
they were evidently in excellent spirits and the wan soon to linen to the meet 
they had no inclination to linen to her 
after laying out for some compliment of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood which anne could not pay they had only a few faint inquiries to make before the talk must be all their own 
uppercrou excited no interest kellynch very little it were all bath 
they had the pleasure of nursing her that bath more than answered their expectations in every respect 
their home was undoubtedly the bell in came place their drawing-room many decided advantage over all the other which they had either ten or heard of and the m minority wan not scorn in the at leg of the fitting-up or t taste of the furniture 
heir persuasion 
xii acquaintance wan exceedingly nought after 
everybody wan wanting to visit them 
they had drawn back from many introduction and still were perpetually having card left by people of whom they knew nothing 
here were found enjoyment 
could anne wonder that her father and thither were hoping she might not wonder but the man night that 5 father should feel no degradation in his change would see nothing to regret in the quiet and dignity of the accident landholder should find no much to vain of in the littleness of a town 
and the mute light and miles and wonder too as elizabeth threw open the foldingdoon and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to the other coming of their space at the possibility of that woman who had been mistress of kellynch hall ending extent to be proud of between two will perhaps thirty feet asunder 
but this was not all which they had to make them ha pry 
they had mr elliott too 
anne had i great deal to hear of mr elliott 
he was not only pardoned they were delighted with him 
he had been in bath about fortnight 
he had used through bath in november in hit way to on on when the intelligence of sir walkers being settled there had of course reached him though only twenty-four hour in the place but he had not been able to avail himself of it 
but he had now been a fortnight hat in bath and his list object on arriving had been joined his card in came lace following it up b inch uniduout endeavour to meet and when they did meet by each great openings of conduct touch reading to apologize for the past inch solicitude to he received m a relation again that their former good understanding was completely re-established 
they had not a fault to and in him 
he had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own kin 40 hinder a 
aside 
it had originated in misapprehension entirely 
he had never had an idea of throwing himself of t he had feared that he was thrown off but knew not why and delicacy had kept him silent 
upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or careless of the family and the family honour he wan quite indignant 
he who had ever doomed of being an idiot and whose feeling at to connection were only too stick to until the unusual tone of the present day 
he wan astonished indeed but his character and general conduct mind refute it 
he could refer sir water to all who knew him 
and certainly the pains he had been taking on thin the foot up rarity of reconciliation robe reentered w the joining of relation and heirreeumptive war a strong proof of hit opinion on the estate circumstance of his marriage too were found to admit of much extenuation 
thin was an article not to be entered on by himself 
but a very intimate friend of his a colonel william a highly rev table in perfectly the gentleman and nor 
an ill looking man sir walker added who was living in very good style in marlborough buildings and had at his own particular retreat been admitted to their acquaintance through mr else it had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage which made a material difference in the discredit of it 
colonel wallis had known mr elliott long had been well acquainted also with his wife had perfectly understood the whole story 
she was certainly not a woman of family but well educated accomplished rich and expensively in love with his friend 
there had been the charm 
she had taught him 
without that attraction not all her money would have tempted idiot and sir water was moreover natured of her having been a very one woman 
here was a great deal to offend the unseen 
a very one woman with a large fortune in persuasion 41 love with him sir walker seemed to admit it as complete apology 
and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light she allowed it to be a great extenuation 
mr elliott had called repeatedly had dined with them once evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for they gave no dinners in 
general 
delighted in short by every proof of cousin notice and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in came place 
anne listened but without quite understanding it 
allowances large allowances must be made for the ideas of those who spoke 
she heard it all under embellishment 
all that sounded extravagantorimtional in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relations 
still however she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared 
in mr elliott wishing after an interval of so many years to be well received by them 
in a worldly view he had nothing to gain by being on terms with sir walker 
nothing to risk by a state of variance 
in all probability he was already the richer of the two and the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title 
a sensible man and he had looked like a cry sensible man why should it be an object to him 
she could only offer one pollution it was pity for elizabeth sake 
there might really have a living former 
though convenience and accident had drawn him a dim rent way 
and now that he could afford to lease himself he i hit mean to pay his addresses to her 
elizabeth was certain ye veryhsndsome 
with swelled elegant manners and her character might never have been penetrated by mr elliott knowing her but in public and when very young himself 
how her temper and understanding might hear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and its 
watson 
rather fearful one 
most earnestly did the with that he might not be too nice or too servant if elizabeth were hit object 
and that elizabeth wan to believe herself to and that her friend mr lay wan encouraging the idea seemed apparent by a glance or two between them while mr elliott frequent visits were talked of 
anne mentioned the glimpse the had had of him at lane but without being much attended to 
oh yes perhaps it had been mr elliott 
they did not know 
it might be him perhaps 
they could not linen to her dear region of him 
they were driving him themselves 
sir walker especially 
he did justice to hit very gentlemanlike up see his air of elegance and father his good-bye face he sensible eye 
but at the same time a most lament his being very much undergoing a defect which time seemed to have indeed 
nor could he pretend to nay that ten year had not altered almost every feature for the wan 
mr elliott appeared to think that he sir walker war looking exactly no he had done when they last parted 
but sir water had a not been able to return the compliment entirely which had embarrassed him 
he did not mean to complain however 
mr elliott was better to look at than most men and he had no objection to he been with him anywhere mr idiot and his friend 
in marlborough he buildings were talked of the whole evening 
ca once walls had been to impatient to be introduced to them and mr elliott is anxious that he should l 2 and there was 3 men walking at present known one to them by description at ill wan in daily expectation of her confinement 
but mr elliott spoke of her an a a most church in woman quite worthy of being known in came place and at noon aches recovered the were to be acquainted 
sir walker thought much of men will 
nasmsrorr 
4 she was it to he an excessively pretty woman beautiful 
a he longed to see her 
e she might make some amends for the many very air faces head continually panting in the streets 
lie worst of bath was the number of its plain women 
he did not mean to say that there were no pretty women but the number of the plain wan out of all proportion 
he had frequently observed as he walked that one hand face would be followed by thirty or six-and-thirty fright 
and once as he had wood m a shop in bond street he had counted eighty-seven women go by one after another without there being a tolerable face among them 
it had been a pretty morning to be sure a sharp front which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of 
but still there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath 
and as for the men 
they were infinitely worse 
such scarecrowat the streets were full of 
it was evident how little the women were used to the eight of anything tolerable by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced 
he had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with colonel wallis who was no one military figure though sandy-haired without observing that every woman eye was upon him 
every woman c was sure to be upon colonel wallis 
modest sir alter 
he was not allowed to escape however 
his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting that colonel wallises corn union might have 1 good a figure as colonel wallis and certain was not and hatred 
a how in mary looking 
a i sir water in the height of his good humour 
2 the inn time i saw her she had a red note but i hope that my not happen every day 
a oh 
no that must have been quite accidental 
in real she has been in very good health and very good god since michaelmas 44 rnasuasrou 
a if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in hard windy and grow chance i would lend her a new hat and polite 
anne wan wondering whether the would venture to suggest that a gown 
or a can would not be liable to any weak mind when i knock at the door i indeed every 
thing 
a knock at the door 
and no angel it was ten o'clock 
could it be mr elliott 
they knew he was to dine in london crescent 
it was possible that he might lamp in hit way home to ask them how they did 
they could think of no one else 
my clay decidedly thou hit it mr elliott knocking my clay wan right 
it all the state which a butler and post-boy could give mr elliott wan ushered into the room 
it was the tame the very same man with no difference but of dread 
anne drew a little back while the other received his compliments and her litter hit apologies for calling at no mutual an hour but a he could not be to near without waiting to know that neither the nor her friend had taken cold the day before am a 
which was all in politely done and no politely taken ll possible but her part must follow then 
sir walker talked of mr youngest daughter 
a mr elliott must give him leave to present him to tell younger days later there we no occasion for remembering mary 
and anne smiling and blushing very becoming owed to mr elliott the pretty feature which he had by no meant forgotten an instantly ii with amusement at hit little part of surprise that he had not been at all aware of who the war 
he looked completely astonished but not more astonished than placed it ye brightened 
and with the most reflect thirty he welcomed the relationship allude to the pain and annexed to be revived 15 an acquaintance already 
he was quite as good-looking as he had persuasion 
4 parted at lane till countenance improved by speaking and his manners were to exactly what they ought to be no polished to easy to early agreeable that she could compare them in excellence to only one penny manner 
they were not the tame but they were perhaps e only good 
he eat own with them and i raved their conversation very much 
there could no doubt of his being a sensible man 
ten minutes were enough to certain that 
hit tone his expression his choice of subject his knowing where to stop it was all the operation of a sensible discerning mind 
as soon to he could he began to talk to her of ye wanting to compare opinion expecting the place but especially wanting to work of the circumstance of their happening to he guest ii the lame inn it the tame time 
to give his own route understand something of here and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying hire respects to her 
she gave him a short account of her party and business at lame 
he regret increased at he listened 
he had put his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs 
had heard voices mirth continually 
thought they must be a most delightful net of people longed to be with them but certainly without the smallest suspicion of mr rang the shadow of i right to introduce himself 
f he had but asked who the party were 
the name of mir-grove would have told him enough 
a well it would nerve to cure him of to bear practice of never taking a question it an inn which he had adopted when quite e young men on the principle of its being very ungenteel to be curious 
the notion 
of a young men of one or two and want said he too to what ll yeomanry in manners e him utter the thing are more absurd i believe than those of my other set of being in the world 
l 46 persuasion 
the folly of the meal they often employ in only to he equalled by the folly of what they have in view but he must not be addressing his rejection anne alone he knew it 
he was noon diffused again among the other and it wan only at intervals that he could return to ye 
he enquiries however produced at length an account of the scene he had been engaged in there soon after hit leaving the place 
having alluded 1 an accident he mum hear the whole 
when he questioned sir water and elizabeth began to question also but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be an 
felt 
she could only compare mr allied to lady runs in the with of really comprehending what had paused and in the degree of concern for what she must have entered in witnessing it 
he said an hour with them 
the elegant little clock on the mantel-piece had struck a eleven with it silver roundly 
and the coachman wan beginning to he heard it 3 dimness telling the lame talk before mr elliott or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long 
anne could not have supposed it possible that her lift evening in came place could have passed 10 well 
chapter wo 
here was one point which anne on returning to her family would have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliott being in love with elizabeth which war her futhcr’l not being in love with my clay 
and he war very far from easy about it when she had been at home a few hours 
on going down to breakfast the next morning 
the found pirsuasioii‘ 
4 there had just been a decent pretence on the lady's side of meaning to leave them 
she could imagine mrs clay to have said that now miss anne was come she could not suppose herself at all wanted 
for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper that must not be any reason indeed 
i assure you i feel it none 
she is nothing to me compared with you 
and she was in full time to hear her father say a my dear madam this must not be 
as yet you ha seen nothing of bath 
a you have been here only to be useful 
you must not run away from us now 
you must stay to beacup'ainted with us wallis the beautiful mrs wallis 
of our line mind i well know the sight of beauty is a gratiﬁcation.” he spoke and looked so much in earnest 
that anne was not surprised to see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself 
her countenance perhaps might ox rest some watchfulness 
but the praise of the one mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister 
the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties and promise to stay 
in the course of the same morning anne and her father chancing to be alone to either he began to compliment her on her imply looks 
he thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks 
her skin her complexion greatly improved 
clearer fresher 
had she been using anything in particular 
no nothing 
merely owned a he supposed 
a no nothing at all 
half he was surprised at that 
and added a certainly you can not do better than continue as you ire 
you can not be better than well 
or i should recommend gowns the constant use of scotland during the spring months 
may clay has been using it at my recommendation and you see what it ll done for her 
you see how it has carried away her freckled 48 reasuaswx 
if elizabeth could but have heard till such personal praise might have struck her especially at it did not appear to anne that the fickle were at all learned 
but everything man take in chance 
the evil of the marriage would be much diminished if elizabeth were also to marry 
all for herself the might always command a home with lady ruined 
lady runeil’a composed mind and polite manners were put to come trial on thin point in her intercourse in came place 
the eight of mercy in inch favour and of anne i overlooked was a perpetual provocation to her there 
and vexed her ll much when the war away up a person in bath who drinks the water gets all the new publication and hat a very large acquaintance half time to be vexed 
all mr elliott became known to her the grew more charitable or more indifferent toward the other 
hit manner were an immediate recommendation 
and on converting with him the found the old a fully a parting the special that the way at first an the to d anne almost ready to exclaim 
can thin be mr elliott 
2 and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man 
everything united in him 
good understanding correct opinion knowledge of the world and a warm heart he had strange feeling family attachment and family honour 
without pride or weakness 
he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune without display 
he just fed for himself in everything essential without begin 
public opinion in any point of worldly decorum 
he war steady observant moderate 
candid 
never man away with my spirit or by ielﬁahneu which fancied itself rang feeling 
and yet with a incivility to what wan amiable and lovely and a value for all the felicities of domestic life which character of fancied enthuiiaarn and violent agitation seldom really poured 
she was tune that he rnnsuesrorr 
4 had not been happy in mania e. colonel wallis-aid it and lady quell saw it 
at it had been no uncle 
to our his mind nor are an noon palirqnct to prevent his thinking afﬁxeecgnrf‘lughoioe 
her at action in mr elliott outweighs all the plague of my clay 
it wan now some years since anne had begun to learn that he and her excellent friend could iometinieu think differently 
and it did not surprise her therefore that lady ruined should lee nothing auspicious or inconsistent nothing to requires more moved than appeared in mr elliott great degree of reconciliation 
a lady runell’r view it we 
perfectly natural that mr elliott at a mature time of life should feel it a most definable object and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people to be on good tenant with the head of his 
family 
the simple price in the world of time upon a head naturally clear and only crying in the heyday of youth 
anne presumed however all to smile about it and at last to mention 
elizabeth 
lady quell listened and looked and made only this ceuu'oue reply 
elizabeth 
very well 
time will explain it were l reference to the future which anne after a little observation 
fell the must submit to 
she could determine nothing at present 
in that house elizabeth must be lit 
and the was in the habit of such general observance an 
nice elliott 2 that any particularity of attention seemed almost impossible 
mr elliott too it must be remembered killed not been a widower even month 
a little delay on his ride might be very inexcusable 
in fact anne could never lee the rope round his hat without fearing that the war the inexcusable one in attributing to him much imagination for though his marriage had not been very happy still it had excited in many well that the could not compare 15 rensuesxon 
have ran remove fromthelwﬁtlim m of it beingdi-glived 
a a a however it might end he wan without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in bath the saw nobody equal to him 
and it waxen great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lane which he seemed to have ll lively a wish to see again and to see more of at himself 
they went through the particular of their first meeting a great many times 
he gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some untasted 
she knew it well 
and the remembered another poem n't look also 
they did not always think alike 
hit value for rank and connexion the perceived to be greater than hen 
it was not merely complaisance it must he a liking to the came which made him enter warmly into her father and little solicitude on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them 
the bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the dowager viscount dalrymple and her daughter the honourable mist carter 
and all the comfort of no 
— came place 
was swept away for many days 
for the dalryrnplel in anew opinion most unfortunately were count of the elliott 
and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly 
anne had never seen her father and winter before in contrast with nobility and the mute acknowledge e herself disappointed 
she had hoped better thing mum their high idea of their own situation in life and was reduced a form a with which the had never forgotten 
a with am they had more pride 
for your cousins 
lady ddrymple and miss carter 
a a our contented paltry rice louder in her care all day long 
sir alter had once been in company with the late mum but had never seen any of the rest of the the difficulties of the case arose from there persuasion 
i 5 i having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late viscount when in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir water at the same time there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch 
no letter of condolence had been sent to ireland 
the neglect had been visited on the head of the inner 
for when poor lady elliott died herself no letter of condolence was received at kellynch and consequently there was but too much reason to s present that the dalrymples considered the relationship as closed 
how to have this anxious business set to rights and be admitted as cousins again was the question and it was a question which in a more rational manner neither lady cassel nor mr elliott thought unimportant 
a family connexions were always worth reserving good company always worth seeking 
lady air place had taken a house for three months in laura lace and would be living in style 
she had been at bath the year before and lady spell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman 
it was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed if it could be done without any compromise of propriety on the side of the elliott 
sir walker however would choose his own means and at last wrote a very one letter of ample ox plantation regret and entreaty to his right honourable e cousin 
neither lady cassel nor mr elliott could admire the letter 
but it did all that was wanted in bringing three lines of scream from the dowager viscountess 
she was very much honoured and should be happy in their acquaintance the toils of the business were over the sweets began 
they visited in laura place they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrymple and the honourable miss carter to be arranged wherever they might be most visible and a our cousins in laura place 
— a our cousins lady dalrymple and miss carter a were talked of to everybody 
sea amor 
anne we learned 
had lady daily life and her daughter even been very agreeable the soul will have been ashamed of the agitation they created but they were nothing 
there was no superiority of manner 
accomplishment or demanding 
lady daily life had acquired the name of a charming woman all the had a mile and a civil answer 5 everybody 
nice carter with will lean to lay wan to plain and to awkward 
that the would never have been tolerated in came place but for her birth 
lady quell confessed that bill had expected something better 
but yet it was an acquaintance worth having 
and when anne ventured to s her opinion of them to mr elliott he agreed to their being nothing in themselves but still maintained that at a family connexion a good come any at there who would collect good can any around them they had their value 
anne smiled and’amd 
a my idea of good company mr elliott it the company of clever well-informed people who have a great d of conversation 
that is what i call good corn nay 
a our ire make a said he gently 2 that in not good company 
that ll the but 
good company required on my mirth education and manner and with regard to education is not very nice 
birth and good manners are evening 
but a little learning it by no means a clean trout thing in good company 3 on the contrary it will do very well 
my cousin anne cheat her head 
she in not retired 
she in futidioru 
my dear cousin sitting down by her a you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman i know 
but will it infer 
will it make on happy 
will it not be wiser to accept the society of these good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion a in an audible 
you may depend upon persuasion i 5 igthatdteywillmoveintheﬁrstoetin baththis winter and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family our family let me any 
i in that degree of consideration which we must all me for ye a sighed anne 2 we shall indeed be known to be related to them 
a then recollecting herself and not wishing to be answered she added a certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance 
i suppose smiling i have more pride than any of you 
but i confess it does vex me that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them 
pardon me my dear cousin you are unjust to your own claims 
in london perhaps in your present quiet style of living it might be as on so 
but in bath sir walker idiot and his family will always be worth knowing always acceptable as acquaintance 
well a said anne 
i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon placed a i love your indignation a said he 
it is so natural 
but here you are in bath and the bet is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walker elliott 
you talk of being proud 
i am called round i know end i shall not wish to believe myself otherwise 
for our pride if investigated would have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem a little different 
in one next i am sure my dear cousin he continued speaking lower thou ho there was no one else in the room 
in one point flame sure we must feel alike 
we must feel that every addition to your father society among his equals or superiors may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him l 4 persuasion 
he looked as he spoke to the neat which men clay had been lately occupied a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant 
and though anne could not believe in their having the nine sort of pride the wan pleased with him for not liking men clay 
and her conscience admitted that hit wishing to promote her father getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defending her 
chapter 17 
while sir water and elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good fortune in laura place anne wan renewing an acquaintance of a very different description 
she had called on her former governess and had heard from her of there being an old schoolfellow in bath who had the two strange claim on her attention of past kindness and present suffering 
miss milton now my smith had shewn her kindness in one of the period 
of her life when it had been moor valuable 
anne had gone unhappy to school grieving for the lost of a mother whom the had dearly loved feeling her separation from home and suffering to a girl of fourteen of strong sensibility and not high spirits must suffer at such a time 
and liable milton three your older than herself but still from the want of near relation 
and a rattled home remaining another year at school had been careful and good to her in a way which had considerable lowered her misery and could never be remembered with indifference 
miss milton had left school had married not long afterwards we laid to have married a man of fortune and this was all that anne had known of her till now reason 
5 5 5 that their govemess’s account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form 
she was a widow and poor 
her husband had been extravagant 
and at his death about two year 
before had left his affairs dreadfully involved 
she had had difficulties of every sort to contend with and in addition to these distress had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever which finally settling in her legs had made her for the present a couple 
she had come to bath on that account and was now in lodgings s near the hot bath living in a very humble way nash e even to nor herself the comfort of a servant and of course almost excluded from society 
their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from miss elliott would give mrs smith and anne therefore lost no time in doing 
she mentioned nothing of what she had he or what she in 
tended at home 
it would excite no robert interest there 
she only consulted lady cassel who entered through into her sentiments and was most ha to convince her as near to mrs smith's lodgings in estate buildings as anne chose to be taken 
the visit was paid their acquaintance re-established their interest in each other more than re-kindled 
the first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion 
twelve years were gone since they had parted and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had may need 
twelve years had changed anne from the blooming silent unfounded girl of fifteen to the e and little woman of seven-and-twenty with every aunt excepting bloom and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle 
and twelve years had transfomlcd the fine-looking well 
grown miss milton in all the glow of health and conscience of superiority into a poor infirm helpless widow receiving the visit of her l 5 6 pensunsrou 
forever protege up a favour but all that won uncomfortable in the meeting had noon paused away 
and left on the interesting charm of remembering former partiahtiet and talking our old times anne found in mrs smith the good awe and agree 
able manner 
which the had almost ventured to d on and a disposition to conveyance and be cheerful beyond her expectation 
neither the dissipation of the put 
and the road lived very much in the world 
nor the restriction of the present neither aicltneu nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirit 
in the courage of a second visit she talked with great opened and anna astonishment increased 
she could scarcely imagine a more cheering situation in itself than mrs smith's 
she had been ve fond of her husband the had buried him 
she had no need to silence it wan gone 
she had no child to connect her with life and happen again no relation to assist in the arrangement of pale fixed affairs no health to make all the rent support life 
her accommodation were limited to a noisy parlour and a dark bedroom behind with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance which there we only one tenant in the house to afford and ill 
never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath 
yet in spite of all this anne had known to believe that the had moment only of languor and derision to hour of occupation and enjoyment 
how could it be 
she watched observed reflected and all determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of recognition only 
a submissive spirit might be silent 
a strong understanding would apply resolution t here wan something more 
hen wan that elasticity of mind that in town to be comforted that were of turning reading 3 
evil to good and of an age persuasion 
i s 7 payment which carried her out of herself 
which was my nature alone 
it was the choicest is of heaven 
and anne viewed her friend me one of those instances in which by a merciful appointment it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want 
there had been a time as smith told her when her spirits had nearly failed 
she could not call herself an invalid now compared with her state on first reaching bath 
then she had indeed been a pitiable object 
for the had caught cold on the journey and had hardly taken possession of her lodging before the was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain 
and all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse and ﬁnanoea at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense 
she had weathered it however and could truly say that it had done her good 
it had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands 
she had seen too much of the world to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere but her illness had proved to her that her landlord had a character to preserve and would not use her ill 
and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse up a sister of her landlord a nurse by profession and who had always a home in that house when unemployed chanced to be at liberty in time to attend her 
and she a said mrs smith besides nursing me most admirably hat really proved an invaluable acquaintance 
as soon as i ca d use my hands she taught me to lift which has been a great amusement 
and she put me in the way of making these little threadbare pin-cushions and card-racks which you always send me so how about and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in thin neighbourhood 
she has a large acquaintance of course professional among those who 5 8 
manor 
can afford to buy and be dispose of m merchandizc 
she always take the right time for a dying 
everybody heart it open you know when they have recently escaped from severe pain or are recovering the being of health and nursed looked thoroughly understand when to speak 
she in a shrewd intelligent sensible woman 
here ii a line for acting human nature 
and ah ha 
a fiend of good fence and observation which at a companion make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received them but education in the world l know nothing worth attending to 
call it going if you will but when nun rocks hill half an hour leisure to bestow on me the it sure to have something to relate that ll entertaining and probable something that makes one know one a better 
one like to hear what it going on to aunt at to the sweat mode being training and till 
to me who live to much alone her conversation i mute you in a train anne far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure replied i am easily believe it 
women of that clue have great or rtunitiea and if they are intelligent may be well we listening to 
such varieties of human nature a they are in the habit of winning 
and it is not merely in in followed that they are well read 
for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting 
what instance must pay before them of ardent disinterested self-denying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation 
of all the confines and all the sacrifice that noble at most 
a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volume a year mind my smith more doubtingly sometimes it ma though i fear in lesson are not often in the clean ill you describe 
here and there human nature may be great in time 
of trial 
but generally msvasrotr 
5 50 speaker g it is it 
weakness and not its men that appears in a sick harsher it is selfishness had in silence rather than generosity and fortitude that one ears offl‘onuthere is so little real friends in th‘e’lworild 
and an lately a skin low an m on there are so man w forget to think seriously villain is almost too late anne saw the misery of such feelings 
the husband had not been what he ought and the wife had been led among that it of mankind which made her think worse 
of the world than she hoped it deserved 
it was but 1 gang emotion however with mrs smith 
she shook it off and soon added in i different tone i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs race is in at present will furnish much either to interest or me 
she is only nursing mrs william of marlborough buildings 
a mere pretty silly expensive fashionable woman i believe 
and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and livery 
i mean to make my post of mrs wallis however 
she has plenty of man and i intend she shall buy all the high-arched things have in hand now anne had called several dress on her friend before the existence of such a person was known in came place 
at last it became necessary to speak of her 
sir walker elizabeth and mrs ugly resumed one morning from laura place with a sudden invitation from lady daily life for the same evening and anne was already engaged to spend that evening in wettest buildings 
she was not sorry for the excuse 
they were only asked the was sure because lady dalrymple being kept at home by a bad cold was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her 
and she declined on her own account with great alacrity 
she was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow

but what does lady rum think of thin acquaintance i a wicked elizabeth

merely who had been present while all thin planned now thought it advisable to leave the room and anne could have said much and did long to lay a little in defence of bar friends not very dissimilar claim to theirs but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her 
she made no reply 
she left it to himself to recollect that man smith was not the only widow in bath between thirty and forty with little to live on and no name of dignity 
anne kept her appointment the other kept there and of course the heard the next morning that they had a delightful evening 
she had been the only one of the let apparent for sir water and elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship service themselves but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others and had been at the trouble of invention both lady roll and mr elliott 
and mr elliott ha made a point of leaving colonel wnlliearly and lady quell had fresh arranged all her evening engagement in order to wait on her

i am no match-making at you well know laid lady quell being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human event and calculations

my dearest anne it would give me more dwell hat than is often felt at my time of life one was-obliged to turn away to rise to walk to s 
distant table and leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue the feelings this picture excited 
for a few moments her imagination an her heart were bewitched 
the idea of becoming what her mother had been 
of having the precious name of a lady elliott rest revived in herself 
of being restored to kellynch calling it her home again her home for ever was a charm which she could not immediately resist 
lady vessel said not another word willing to leave the matter to its own operation 
and believing that could mr elliott at that moment with propriety have s late for himself l 
she believed in short what anne d not believe 
the same image of mr elliott speak in for himself brought anne to composure a 
the charm of kellynch and of a lady elliott all faded away 
she never could accent him 
and it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one 
her judgment on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against mr elliott 
though they had now been an minutes a month she could not be satisfied that she read my knew his character 
that he was i sensible man an agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle this was all clear enough

there was never any hum of feeling an warmth of indignation or delight at the evil or good of others

she wanted to hear much more than mary communicated 
it was three weeks since the had heard at all 
she once that henrietta we at home again 
and that in though considered to be recovering fat was still at lame 
and key was thinking of them all very intently one evening when a thick letter than ma from mary was delivered to her 
and to quicken the pleasure and surprise with admiral and he croft'u compliments 
the crowd man be in both a circumstances to interest her 
they were people whom her heart turned to v naturally

the home was cleared yesterday except of the little caviller but you will be surprised to bear that they have never gone home 
my caviller must be an odd mother to part with them in long 
i do not understand it 
they are not at all nice children in my opinion 
but my grove seem to like them write or well if not better than her grandchildren 
hat dreadful weather we have had 
it may not be felt in bath with your nice pavement 
but in the country it it of come consequence 
i have not had a creature call on me time the second week in january except charles hated who he 
been calling much oftener than war welcome 
between ourselves i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lane a long an louisa 
it would have kept her a little out of his way 
the carriage in gone to-day to bring louder and the caviller to-morrow 
we are not used to dine with them however till the day after my grove in no afraid of her being fatigued by the journey 
which ll not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her 
and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow 
i am glad you and mr allied to agreeable and with i could be acquainted with him too 
but i have my usual luck i am always out of the way when anything desirable persuasion 
i on going on

does she never mean to go away 
but perhaps isle were to leave the room vacant we might not be invited 
let me know what you think of this 
i do not expect my children to he asked you know 
i can leave them at the great house very well for in month or six weeks 
i have this moment heard that the cross are going to bath almost immediately they think the admiral gouty 
charles heard it quite by chance that have not had the civility to give me any notice or of her to take anything 
i do not think they in me at all as neighbours 
we see nothing of them and thin is really an instance of gross inattention 
charles join me in love and everything proper

a very kind friendly note indeed addressed to me just a it ought 
i shall therefore be able to make my letter as long an i like

she had never in her life been more moralised captain bench and mansion

it woe almost too wonderful for belief and it was with the great effort that the could remain in the room preserve air of calmness and newer the common question of the moment 
ha ill for her they were not many 
sir walker want to know whether the cross travelled with four horses and whether they were loth to be situated in such a plan of bath at it might suit in idiot and himself to visit in 
but had little curiosity beyond 
a how in mary 
a said elizabeth 
and without waiting for in answer and pray what brings the cross to both i 
they come on the admiral account 
he ll thought to be gouty 
gout and decrepitude 
mind sir walker 
a poor old gentleman 
a have they any acquaintance here 
a marked elizabeth 
a i do not know 
but i can hardly suppose that at admit 
croft'l time of life and in his profusion he should not have many acquaintance in such i place as this 
i so exact a said sir walker coolly 2 that admiral profit will be bent known in bath up the renter of kellynch hall 
elizabeth may we venture to present him and his 
wife in laura place 
a a oh no 
i think not 
situated us we are with lady dalrymple chain we ought to be very careful not to them her with ucquamunce the i hit not approve 
if we were not related it would not signify 
but a quite the would feel scrupulous an to any proposal of ours 
we had better leave the cross to and their own level 
there are several good-looking men walking about here who i am told are still 
the coffee will associate with them 
thin wan sir water and elizabeth share of i 1 2 persuasion 
interest in the letter 
when my clay had her tribute of more decent attention in an enquiry after charles grave and her one little boy anne war it liberty 
in her own room the tried to come reached it 
well i hit charles wonder how captain unworthy would feel i perhaps he had quieted the field had louisa up had sealed to love had found he did not love her 
she could not endure the idea of treachery or levity or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend 
she could not endure that such a friendship on their should be covered unfairly 
captain benwiclt and love reprove 
the high-epirited joyoue-tallting louisa grove and the detected thinking feeling reading captain benwiclt 
seemed each of then everything that would not suit the other 
their minds most dissimilar 
where could have been the attraction 
the answer noon presented itself 
it had been in imitation 
they had been thrown together several week 
they had been living in the lame unwell family party since henrietta’n coming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each other and leaning just recovering from illness had been in an interesting lute 
and captain'benwick wan not inconsolable 
that was a point which anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before 
in and of drawing the same conclusion as mary from the resent course of events they arrived only to confirm the idea of his having felt some drawing of tenderness toward herself 
she did not mean however to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity than mary might have allowed 
she was persuaded that any tolerably genuine young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the lame compliment 
he had an affectionate heart he must love somebody 
persuasion 
i 7 i she saw no reason against their being by 
love harding naval fervour to begin with an they would soon grow more alike 
he would gain cheerfirlneae and the would learn to he an enthuaiut for scott and lord baron 
nay that wan probably learnt already 
of course they had fallen in one over poetry 
the idea of foul grove turned into a pen of literary taste and sentimentally rejection war amusing 
but the had no doubt of in being no 
the day at ye the fall from the cook might indolence her health her newer her courage her character to the end of her life thoroughly an it appeared to have induced her fate 
the conclusion of the whole wan that if the woman who had been sensible of captain wentworth’e merits could be allowed to prefer another room there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder 
and if captain pennyworth lost no friend it certainly nothing to he regretted 
no it was not regret which made angel heart beat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheeks when the thought of captain pennyworth unshackled and free 
she had some feeling 
which she was ashamed to investigate 
they were too much like joy amenable joy 
she longed to lee the cross 
but when the meeting took place it was evident that no manor of the new had yet reached them 
the visit of ceremony wan paid and returned 
and louisa grove war mentioned 
and captain brick too without even half a mile 
the cross had placed themselves in lodgings in gay streetlperfeetly to sir walkers satisfaction 
he wan not at l ashamed of the acquaintance and did in fact think and walk a great deal more about the admiral than the admiral ever thought or talked about him 
the crowd 
knew quite ii many people in bath at m 
31 persuasion 
they wished for 
and considered their intercourse with the elliott at a mere matter of form and not in the left likely to afford them any pleasure 
they brought with them their common habit of being always together 
he wondered to w to keep off the gout mind on soft seemed to go that with him in everything and to walk for her life to do him good 
anne saw them wherever the went 
lady quell took her out in her carriage elliott every morning 
and the never failed to think of them and never failed to treatment 
knowing their feelings up the did it was a meet attractive picture of happiness to her 
she always watched them a long it the could 
delighted to fancy the understood what they might be talking of at they walked along in hat independence or equallzadelrghred to see the edymirtl’t energy shake of the end when he encountered an old friend and observed their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into i little note of the navy on soft looking an intelligent and keen at any of the pitch around her 
anne was too much engaged with lady utterly to he often walking herself 
but it to hop end that one morning about a week or ten day a 5 the profits arrival it united her best to leave her friend or her friend carriage in the lower part of the town and return tone to condemn place end in walking up milton street the had the good fortune to meet with the admiral 
he wan ending by himself at a print-shops window 
with hit hand behind him in earnest contemplation of some print and the not only might have parted him unseen but will obliged to touch at well a direct him before the could catch hit notice 
when he did perceive and acknowledge her however it viii done with all full usual frankness and good-humour

i an tell on for putting iii in mind of those we mr hadnot north errant 
the wind blow through one of the board in the lame way 
when they were got a little farther anne venture again for what he had to communicate 
she had he 
when clear of milton street to have her curiosity untied 
but the we still obliged to wait for the admiralhadmadeuphia mind not to begin tilltheyhad gained the greater face and quiet of almost 
end a all was not really my cross the man let him have hit own way 
at won as they were fairly ascending below he began 
— a well now you shall hear something that will april you 
but dint of all you men tell me the name of the young lady i am going to tall about 
that young lady you know that we have all been to concerned for 
the ma mil-grove that all thin ha been happening to 
her christian name i always forget her christian name anne had been ashamed to appear to come round to loan ii the really did 
but now the could i rely suggest the name of a long 
ay ay mialouiu grove that it the name 
which 
i i rich young ladies had not much i number of line christian names 
i should never be out if they were all sophia or something of that sort 
well this in india we all thought you know was to marry frederick 
he war courting her week after week 
the only wonder on what they could be waiting for till thebusineaaat became 
then indeed it was clear enough that they must wait 
till her brain want to right 
but even then there war something odd in their way of going on 
instead of staying at lame he went on to plymouth and then he went off to see edward 
when we came back from forehead he was gone down to edward's and there he has been ever since 
we have been nothing of him since november 
em sophia could not under it 
but now the matter he taken the man a turn of all 
for this young lady thin lame mill grove instead of being to marry frederick ll to marry james brunswick 
you know james brunswick 2 
a little 
i am a little acquainted with certain benwick.” well he in to my him 
nay most likely they are married already for i do not know what they should wait for c. b 1 i thought in quick a leaving no man said after and i undenta'nedydfat he is excellent character 
oh 
yes yes there ll not a word to he said again james brunswick 
he in only a command it ll true made last summer and these are bad temper for getting on but he had not another fault that i know of 
an excellent good-hearted fellow i assure you 
a very active zealous officer too which in more than you would think for perhaps 
for that united effort of manner a dear not do him junior 1 indeed you are mistaken there air 
i should never 16 resume 
augur want of spirit from captain beuwick't manner 
i thought them particularly and i will answer for it 
they would generally pleue.’ a well well ladies are the heat judges 
but james bench in there piano for me 
and though very likely it in all our partiality shy and i can not help thinking frederick s manner better than he 
there in something about frederick more to our rued anne wascaught.‘ she had only meant to apply the too common idea of spirit and gentleman being incompatible with each other not at all to represent captain benwick’t manner a the very best that could point he 
and after a little habitation the vicar beginning to buy a i wan not entering into any comparison of the two friend 
a but the arrival interrupted her with 
and the thing it certainly true 
it in not a mere itof group 
we have it from frederick himself 
hit litter had a letter from him yesterday in which he tell us of it and he had just had it in a letter from caviller written upon the spot from uppercrou 
i flung they are ill at uppercroea 
hit wan an opportunity which anne could not resist 
the maid therefore i hope admiral i there it nothing in the it leg of captain wentworth’t letter to make you and he crept particularly uneasy 
it did certainly seems last autumn if there were an attachment between him and love motive 
but i hope it may he understood to have worn out on each tide equally and without violence 
i hope hall letter doze 
not breathe the spirit of an inflamed man 
not at all not at all there in not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end anne looked down to hide her smile 
no no 
frederick is not a man to while and complain 
he hat too much spirit for that 
if the girl numerous 
xl fewer nun ham it in very it up should have a certainly 
but what i mean in that i hope there in nothing in wentworth’l manner of writing to make you suppose he think himself inflamed by his friend which might appear a know without it being absolutely lid 
i should very carry the inch a friendship ii he 
inherited between him and caring brunswick should be destroyed or even wounded x a clrcnmnance of thin tart 
yes tea i understand you 
but there ll nothing at all of nature in the letter 
he does not give the lent ring at brunswick 
don't in much lay a i wonder at it 
i have a mean of my own for wondering at it no you would not guns from his way of writing that he had ever thought of this mind what 3 her name 
for himself 
he very handsomely hope that will be happy together 
and there ll nothing very urn given in that i think anne d not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant to convey but it would have been useless to pity the enquiry farther 
she therefore stirred her with common-place remark or quiet attention and the admiral had it all hit own way 
poor frederick laid he at an 
now he must begin all over a air with somebody else 
i think we met get him to the 
shy must write and beg him to come to bath 
here are pretty girl enough amore 
itwouldheafnouaeto tour rose again for that other in grave and mob by her cousin the young patron 
do not on think mien elliott we had better try to get him on if i 8 nasunsron 
charm 13 
while admiral soft was taking that wall with anne and expecting hit with of getting ca m pennyworth to bath captain pennyworth was ready on hit way thither 
before mrs cross had written he war arrived and the very next time anne walked out 
the law him 
mr elliott war attending hit two cousins and my clay 
they were in milton street 
it began to rain not much but enough to make better delicate for women and quite enough to make it very desirable for maria allied to have the advantage of being conveyed home in lady dalrymple’e carriage which war been waiting at a little distance the anne and my clay therefore turned into morland while mr allied to lady dahymplc w requested her romance 
soon joined them again nieces-fill of course 
lady dalrymple would be most happy take them home and would call for them in a few minute 
her ladyship carriage was a branch and did not hold more time four with any comfort 
in scattered wet with her mother 
consequently it war not remarkable to expect accommodation for all the three came place ladies 
there could be no doubt at to mine elliott 
whoever suffered inconvenience the mute wife none but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two 
the rain err a mere trifle and anne was most lingered in preferring a walk with mr elliott 
but the rain was also a mere trifle to my clay 
the would hardly allow it even to drop at all and her books were so thick 
much thick than mine anne's 
and in about her civility rendered her quite at anxious to be left to walk with mr elliott us anne could he and it we discussed between them unsunsron 
a 19 with a generosity so polite and so determined that the others were obliged to settle it for them 
miss elliott maintaining that mrs clay had a little cold spread and mr elliott deciding on a that hit cousin news boats were rather the which it was fixed accordingly that mrs clay 
should he of the party in the carriage 
and they had just reached this not when anne as she eat near the window descended most decidedly and distinctly captain wentwotth walking down the street 
her start was perceptible only to herself 
but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world the most unaccountable and absurd 
for a few minute 
she saw nothing before her it was all confusion 
she was lost and when the had scolded back her sense she found the others still waiting for the carriage and mr elliott always obliging 
just setting off for union sheet on a commission of mrs clay s 
she now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door 
she wanted to see if it rained 
why was the to suspect herself of another motive 
captain pennyworth man be out of sight 
she left her seat she would go 
one half of her should not he always to much wiser than the other half or always msgecn‘ng the other of being worse than it was 
she wool see if it rained 
she was sent back however in a moment by the entrance of captain pennyworth himself among s party of gentlemen and ladies evidently his acquaintance and whom he must have joined a little below milsom street 
he was more obvious struck and confused by the right of her than she had ever observed before 
he looked quite red 
for the first time since their renewed acquaintance she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two 
she had the advantage of him in preparation of the last few moments 
all 18 persuasion 
the overpowering blinding bewildering one effect of many surprise were over with her 
till however he had enough to fell it v agitation pin pleasure 
a nothing between delight and ninety 
he spoke to her end then turned awe 
the character of hit manner wan ernhnmument 
he could not have called it either cold or friendly or anything no certainly an unlimited 
after i hurt interval however he came toward her and spoke again 
mule inquiries on common inhneitherofthemmmhnhly much their for w t they heard and anne continuing fully exile of his having tea at one than formerly 
they had dint 
of being in very much merrier got to speak to eat other with a considerable man ofawanntindiﬁ'erenoe and calmly 
but he ca d not do it now 
time had changed him or long had changed him 
there wan conlcinulnen of some sort or other 
he looked very well not an if he had been suffering in health or pink and he talked of uppercrole of the mulgrovee nay even of long and had even a momentary look of his own arch iigniﬁcanee no he named her 
but 
yet it we ca lain pennyworth not comfortable not easy not able to sign that he was 
it did not caprice but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth would not know him 
she evil that he law elizabeth that elizabeth law him that there wan come let internal recognition on each ride 3 the we 
cum/laced that he wan ready to be acknowledged an an acquaintance expecting it and he had the pain of may her deter turn away with umlremhle coldness 
lady dalrymyle carriage her which in elliott wan growing very impatient now drew up 
the servant came in to announce it 
1 war beginning to rain again and after gathered there wan i delay and a hide de talking

she had never found it no difficulty to to him though nothing could exceed his solitude and care and brought his subject were principally arch in were wont to he always interesting praise warm jump and indiscriminating of lad swell and insinuations highly rational against my c ay

she could not under his present feeling whether he were really uttering mud from disappointment or not 
and ill that point were rattled the could not be quite herself 
she hope be wise and venerable in time 
but all along the mute confer to herself that the war not wise yet another circumstance very essential for her know was how long he meant to be in bath

but at last in returning down pulteney street the distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such distance up to leave him in view the greater part of the meet 
there were many other men about him many grouped walking the same way but 
there was no making him 
she looked instinctively at lady run but not from any mad idea of her recognizing him no noon at the did himself

lady unwell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite 
she looked at her however from now to time anxiously

her eye could not reach him

area mind we in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening 
it war just occupation enough the had feeling for the tender spirits for the gay attention for the scientiﬁc and patience for the wearisome 
and had never liked a concert better at least during the list act 
towards close of it in the interval succeeding an italian along she explained the words the song to mr elliott 
they had a concert bill between them 
this a laid the 4 in nearly the fence or rather the running of the worth for certainly the sense of an italian love-song must not he talked of but it it no nearly the means an i can give 
for i do not pretend to understand theiangunge

a i will not of such kind politeness 
but i should be sorry to examined by a real proficient 
i have not had the pleasure of visiting in came places long a replied he a without knowing something of mine anne elliott 
and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware 1 of half her accomplishment and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman 1 for shame 
for shame thin to too much of flattery 
i forget what we are to have next turning to the bill 
perhaps said mr elliott 
speaking low i have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of a indeed how so 
you can have been acquainted with it only since i came to bath excepting an us might he 
me previous spoken of in my own fear my 
i knew you by report long before you came to bath 
i had heard you described by those who knew you intimately 
i have been acquainted with you by character many years 
your person your disposition accomplishment manner 
they were all described they were all present to me 
mr elliott was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise 
no one can withstand the charm of such a mystery 
to have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance by nameless place in irresistible 
and anne wan all curiosity 
he wondered and questioned him eagerly 
but in vain 
he delighted in being asked but he would not tell 
a no no some time or other perhaps but not now 
he would mention no names now 
but such he could assured her had been the fact 
he had many years ago received inch 1 description of miss anne elliott as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excited the warmest curiosity to know her 
nesrmsron 
3 anne could think of no one so likely to have kin with parting of her many year a off as the mr unworthy of oxford captain entworth’s brother 
he might have been in mr elliott s company but he had not courage to all the union 
2 the name of anne elliott did he has long had an interesting sound to me 
very long has it presented a charm over my fancy 
and if i dared i would breathe my whither that the name might never change such she believed were his words 
but scarcely had she received their bound than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her which rendered everything else trivial

a her eyes fell on him his learned to be withdrawn from her 
it had that appearance 
it seemed as if she had been one moment too late 
and as long as she dared observe he did not look again but the performance wan recommending and the vicar forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward 
when she could give another glance he had moved away 
he could not have come nearer to her if he 19 mutton

the others returned the room filled again benches were received in recovered and another hour of pleasure or of penance wan to he eat out another hour of march was to give delight or the grapes an real or neglected rate for it required 
to anne it cried wore the prospect of an 5 of agitation 
she could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain pennyworth once more without the interchange of one friendly look 
in regretting themselves there were now many changes the result of which was favourable for her 
colonel wallis declined sitting down a a and mr elliott woe invited by elizabeth and in regret in a manner not to be refuted to lit between them 
and by name other removal and a little scheming of her own anne was enabled to place himself much more the end of the bench than the had been before much more within reach of a passer-by 
she could not do so without pusrmsron

but ill she did it end not with much effect 
though what seemed up city in me of an early abdkiycation in her next me he found herself it the very end of the bench before the concert closed

anne replied and spoke in defence of the performance to well and in an allowance for his feelings to pleasantly that countenance improved and he replied again with almost a mile 
they talked for a few minutes more 
the impmvelnent held 
he even looked down towards the bench us if he saw a plate on it well worth once in 
when at that moment a touch on her shoulder anne to turn round 
it came from mr elliott 
he begged her pardon but she man be applied to to explain italian again

i who d like to know why you imagine i am 2 men smith looked at her again looked eagerly united shook her head and exclaimed 
a now how i do wish i understood on 
how i do with i knew what a were all have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel when the right moment corner 
till it do come you know we women never mean to have anybody 
it is a thing of course among us that every man in refusing till he ordered 
but why should you he cnlel.’ let me plead for my 
prudent friend i can not call him but for my former friend 
where can you look for a more suitable match 
where could you expect a more gentlepersuasion 
30 i like agreeable nun 
let me recommend mr elliott 
i am sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel wallis 
and who can know him better than colonel wallis 
my dear mr smith mr elliott wife has not been dead much above half a ear 
he ought not to be so proposed to be paying his addresses to on one 
he if these are your only objection cried mr 
smith archly 1 mr elliott is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him 
do not forget me when you are married that s all 
let him know me to be a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required which it is very natural for him now with many affair and engagements of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can 
very natural perhaps 
ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same 
of course he not be aware of the importance to me 
well my dear miss elliott i hope and trust you will be very happy 
mr elliott has lent to understand the value of such a woman 
your peace will not be uhinvreckcd as mine has been 
you are safe in all wo duly matters and safe in his character 
he will not be led stray 
he will not be misled by others to his ruin a 
no a maid anne 1 i can readily believe all that of my cousin 
he feet have a calm decided temper not at all open to dangerous impressions 
i consider him with great respect 
i have no reason from anything that ha 
fallen within my observation to do otherwise 
but i have not known him long 3 and he is not i man us i think to be known intimate soon 
will not this manner of speaking of him airs smith convince you that he is nothing to me 
surely this must be calm enough 
and upon my word he is nothing to me 
should he ever propose to me which i have we little reason to imagine he had any thought of doing

that the had implied in much 
but luwou‘ldqlnrdly have been ancient 
my smith would hardly have believed in noon in mr elliott failure but from the perception of there being a somebody else 
as it was she amply submitted 
and with i the enhance of seeing nothing beyond 
and anne eager to escape farther notice wan impatient to know why man smith should have fancied the was to marry 5 elliott 
where the could have received the idea or from whom he could have hard it 
do tell how it came into our head 
a a it line came into my had a red led my smith 
upon ending how much were together and feeling it to be the most pmbabremthing in the world to he wished for by everybody belonging to either of you 
and you may defend upon it that all your acquaintance leave dispose of you in the me way 
but i never heard it spoken of till two day ago 
and hot it indeed been spoken of 
a a did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when on called l 1 no

who -the-hye had a great curiosity no see on and war de agreed to be in the way to let on in 
he came away from marlborough building on your sunday 
and she it wan who told me you were to marry mr elliott 
she had had it from men walking herself which did not seem had authority 
she not an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole history 
mansion 
2 the whole memory l related anne laughing 
“shecouldnotrnnke i very on

but a continued anne present although there jew truth in my having thin claim on mr elliott i lhouldbeextmmelyhn yoube ofuleto you in any we that i could 
s i mention to him your being a in this shall i any change 
no i thank you no certainly not 
in the warmth of the moment and under a wicked impression i might 
perhaps have endeavoured to intend you in some drcumeuncels but not now 
no i thank you i have nothing to trouble you with 
i think you spoke of having known mr elliott many sum up i a i did 
not before married i no prose 
a a yet 
he was not married w i knew him into a and 
were you much acquainted i 
a intimately indeed 
then do tell me what he was at that time of life 
i have a great curiosity to know what mrelliotwu an every young man 
was he at ill inch 1 he year now 
a a i have not seen mr elliott these three years a was my smith never given so gravely that it was impossible to none the subject farther 
and anne felt that the gained nothing but an income of curiosity 
they were both silent if smith very thoughtful 
at em 
a i beg your pardon m dear mine elliott she cried in her natural tone of cox reality 1 i beg your pardon for the short answer 
i have been given you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do 
i have been doubting and wondering i to what i ought to tell you 
a dog summon 
there were many things be taken into the account 
one after to he opinion to be giving had in a no making mischief 
even the uncouth trace of family 
union deem worth preserving though there may nothing durable heath 
however i have determined 
think i am right 
i think you ought to be rude as waited with mr elliott tell character 
though fully believe that at pmmyyou sure notched smallest intention of accepting him there in no loving v what may hit 
you might lame time or other be differently 5 acted towards him 
hear the truth therefore now while you are prejudiced 
mr elliott in a man without hurt or conscience 
its origin airy cold-blooded being 
who think 
only of htmaell‘ 
who for his own interest or use would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery that could he perpetrated without risk of his 
general character 
he ha no feeling for other 
those whom he has been the chief chance of leading into ruin 
he ran neglect and desert without the smallest compunction 
he in totally beyond the reach of my sentiments of justice or companion 
oh 
he ll lock it hurt 
hollow and black 
angel astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pale and in i calmer manner he added a my cxpreuionl startle you 
you run allow for an injured angry woman 
but i will to command myself 
i will not amuse him 
i will only tell you what i have found him 
futihall peak 
he won the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him at good ii himself 
the intimacy had been formed before our marriage 
i mud t em most intimate friends 
and i too became executive pleased with mr idiot and entertained the high opinion of him 
at nineteen on know one the 
not think ve seriously 
but mr elliott c to too quite ii at other 
and much more agreeable a l persuasion 
2 than mot others 
and we were almost always either 
we were principally in town 
living in very style 
he war then the inferior in drcummacea 
he war then the poor one 
he had chamber in the temple and it was a match 
he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman 
he had always a home with us whenever he chose it 
he was always welcome 
he war like a brother 
my poor charles who had the nest moor l spirit in the world would have divided hide but farthing with him 
i know that he pnnewalopento him 
i know that he often united him a thin must have been about that very gold of mr elliott life laid anne which had ways excited my particular curiosity 
it must have been about the use time that he became known to my father and time 
i never knew him myself i only heard of him 
but there war a something in all conduct then with regard to my father and deter and afterwards in the circumeuncel of will mania e which i never could quite reconcile with present mr 
it seemed to announce a different sort of man 
i know it all i know it all a cried mr smith 
a he had been introduced to sir water and your deter before i was acquainted with him but i heard him speak of them for ever 
1 know he war invited and encountered and i know he did not choose to go 
i can satisfy you chapel on points which you would little expect 
an as to hit marriage i knew all about it at the time 
i w privy to all the on and again 
i was the friend to whom he concluded his hopes and place 
and though i did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards or at lent till within the last two years of her life and can lower an question you with to put nay a said anne 1 i have particular enquiry c 16 persuasion 
to make about her 
i have always understood were not i happy couple 
but i should like to know why at into time of his life he should slight my father's acquaintance as he did 
my father certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him 
why did mr elliott draw back i a mr elliott a man smith 
at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by i rather quicker procethan the law 
he woe determined to make it by marriage 
he we 
determined at lent not to mary it by an impatient marriage 
and i know it was his belief whether journey or not of course i can not decide that your father and colder in their civilities and invitation were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered 
his idea of wealth and indqlcndencc 
that wan his motive for drawing back i can name you 
he told me the whole story 
he had no concealment 
with me 
it was curious that having us left you behind me in bath my first and pencil acquaintance on worrying should be your cousin 
and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister 
he described one mile idiot and i thought my affectionately of the 
other 
perhaps a cried anne mock b a sudden idea you sometimes spoke of me to mr elliott 
tom before i did 
very often 
i uncle to boat of my own anne idiot and vouch for your being a very different creature from 
a she checked herself in time 
this accounts for something which mr elliott said last night cried anne 
this explains it 
i found he had been mad to hear of me 
i could not come defend how 
what wild inn stations one for w ere a dear self is concerned 
now cure to be mistaken 
hang 
its butler ourpordon 
i have interrupted you 
mr elliott united then completely for money 
the circle probably which first opened your eyes to characterit men smith hesitated 3 little here 
oh 
those thing are too common 
when one lived in the world a man or woman marrying for money ll too common to strike one up it ought 
i wan very young and associate only with the young and we were a thoughtless ye net without any strict rules of conduct 
we lived or enjoy i think differently now 
time andiicknee and sorrow have given me other notions 
but at that i must own raw nothing reprehensible in what mr elliott was doing 
to do the better himself passed at a duty 
a but was not the a red low woman 
a yew 
which 1 object to but he would not rid 
money masterly wan all that he wanted 
her after me a gaze her grandfather hid been a butcher but that was all nothing 
she will a one woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliott company and fell in love with him 
and not a difficulty or a couple was there on his ride with respect to her birth 
all his caution was spent in being censured of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself depend upon it whenever enemy mr elliott may have for hit own situation in life now 
up a young my he had not the unallied value for it 
his chance of the bell inch estate wan nothing but all the honour of the family he held at cheap 5 dirt 
i have often heard him declare that if baronctciea were miserable anybody should have hit for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included 
but i will not pretend to repeat halfthzt tuned hear him my on that subject 
it would not be fair 
and yet you ought to have proof for 28 persuasion 
what it all thin but union and you shall have indeed my dear mr smith i want none cried anne 
you have needed nothing oonmdicto to what mr elliott appeared to be some year ago 
1.lzhia in all in confirmation rather of what we need to hear and believe 
i am more curious to know why he would be no different now 
but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary 
stay i am sir you will have the mill greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom 
and bringing me the mall inlaid box which you will and on the upper shelf of the closet anne eyeing her friend to be ready bent on it did an the wan desired 
the box we brought and placed before her and mr smith fighting over it up the unlocked it hid 
this in full of paperbelonging to him to my husband 
a wall portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him 
the letter i am looking for wan one written by mr allied to him before our marriage and happened to be lived 
why one can hardly imagine 
but he was careful and methodical like other men about these things 
and when i came to examine hire pit to i found it with the nail more trivial from die erect pale scattered here and there while many longer an memorandum of real in chance had been destroyed 
here it in 
i would not burn it became being even then very little talked with mr elliott i was determined to pretend every moment of former intimacy 
i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it 
thin wan the letter directed to charge smith 
tunbridge wall a and dated from london at far s at july 18th 
rznsunsron

smith 
i have received young 
your kindness almost overtaken me 
i with nature had made such heart as you more common but i have lived three-and-twenty year in the world 
and have seen none like it 
at present believe me i have no need of your service 
being in cash again 
give me joy i have got rid of sir water and more 
they are gone back to kellynch and almost made me wear to visit them thin summer 
but my great visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor to tell me how to bring it with but advantage to the farmer 
the baronet neverthdcaa ll not unlikely to marry again 
he in quite fool enough 
if he docile 
however they will leave me in peace which may be a decent equivalent for the aversion 
he in worse than last year 
a i with i had an name but elliott 
i am sick of it 
the name of alter i can drop thank god 
and i desire you will never insult me with my second w 
again meaning for the rent of my life 
to be only your

idiot 
such a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow 
and my smith observing the high colour in her face afraid 
he 
the in e i know in being disrespectful 
though i havgemfgrgot the exact terms have a perfect impression of the general meaning 
but it shows you the man 
mark her professional to my poor husband 
can anything be longer i 
anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father 
she obliged to recollect that her feeling the letter war a violation of the laws of honour that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such heatimonies that no rank corner whence could bear the eye of them be more the cool recover calmness enough no

i can not note written proof again but i an give an nuthenuc moral acrimony as you can desire of what he it now wanting and what he in now doing

on monday evening my good friend on looked let me that much into the accustom marlborough building 
when i talked of a whole history therefore you ice i war not remaining of much at you wppoaed.’ my dear mr smith

he made towards reconciliation with my life

i foundthemon theme friendly terms when i arrived a i know you did 
i know it all perfectly but 
indeed mr smith we must not expect to get real information in inch 3 line

which are to through the hands of to many to be conceived wildly in one and ignorance in another you hardly have much truth lee 
only have me a hearing 
you will noon be able judge of the general credit due by listening to come particular which you can yourself immediately contradict or concern 
nobody supposes that you were his list inducement 
he had seen you indeed before he arm to bath and admired you 
but without knowing it to be you 
so lay my human at lent 
it thin true 
did he see you lent summer or autumn 1 somewhere down in the went to use her own words without knowing it to be you in a he certainly did 
so far it ll very true 
at lame 
i happened to be at lame 
a well a continued mrs smith trim hardly a grant my friend the credit due to the employment of the list point asserted 
he saw you then at lame and liked you so well up to be exceedingly pleased to meet with us again in came place as him anne idiot and ran that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visit there 
but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain 
if there in anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable into me 
my account farm that your limb friend the lady now staying with you whom i saw heard our mention came to bath with mine idiot and in water so long ago as september in short when they worst came themselves and ha 
been 2 l 2 pmasioii 
saying there ever since 
that ill is a clever inalmllting hardening woman 
poor and plausible and altogetberwchinn'tnationlodmanner utogivea general idea among sir walker acquaintance of her meaning to be lady idiot and as general a that .1.elliot should he apparently blind to the day 
ere men smith paused a moment 
hutannehad not a word to say and the continued 
this wan the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it 
and colonel walls had his eye upon your father enough to be mild of it 
though he did not then wait in came place 
but his regard for mr elliott gave him an interest in watching all that wan going on there and when mr elliott came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the m beginning to prevail 
now you are to undergo into time had worked a very material change in mr elliott opinion as to the value of a baronetcy 
upon all point of blood and connexion he in a completely altered man 
having long had an much man at he could tend nothing to with for on the date of avarice or indulgence he hat been gradually coming to pin he happened upon the consequence he in heir to 
i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it in now a confirmed feeling 
he can not beardxeideaofnotheing sir william 
you may guess therefore 
that the next he heard from his friend could not he very agreeable and you may guess what it produced 
the resolution of coming back to bath an won an public and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the persuasion 
2 i 3 degree of his danger end of circumventing the lady if he found it material 
thin was a upon between the two friend 
an the only thing to done 
and colonel wallis wan to until in every way that he could 
he was to be introduced and my wallis war to be introduced 
and everybody wan to be introduced 
mr elliott came back accordingly 
and on application was forgiven us now admitted into the family 
and there it was his constant object and hit only oléjectvyill your arrival added another motive 
to watch it alter and my clay 
he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way 
all at all hours 
but i need not be particular on thin subject you can imagine what an artful man would do 
and with thin e in perhaps my recollect what you have seen him a 
yet a laid anne 1 you tell me nothing which duet not accord with what i have known or could imagine 
there in always something offensive in the detail of cunning 
the manoeuvre of eelliahnen and duplicity must ever be revolving but i have heard nothing which really surprised me 
i know that who would be shocked by such a representations of mr idiot who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been fatigued 
i have always wanted acre other motive for his conduct than appeared 
i should like to know his prevalent opinion a to the probability of the event he hat been in dread of 
whether he consider the danger to be evening or not 
evening i understand replied my smith 
a he think my clay afraid of him aware that he see through her and not daring to proceed at the might do in his absence 
but since he fun he been some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while the hold her present influence 
mr walking hand amusing idea a nurse tell me that it ll to but i i

a i am very lad to know all this a aid anne after little thought my 
a it will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him but shall know better what to do 
my line of conduct will be more direct 
mr elliott in evidently a ditingenuoun artificial world man who hat had never any better principle to go this than iclﬁnhneu.” but mr elliott want yet done with 
my smith had been carried away from her first direction and anne had forgotten in the interest of her own family concern how much had been originally implied against him 
but her attention was now called to the explanation ofthat lit hints 
and ill listened to a recital which if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of my smith proved him to have been very unfeeling in hit conduct towards 
very deficient both in justice and companion 
she learned that the intimacy between them continuing impaired by mr elliott 1 marriage they had been a before always together and mr elliott had led hit friends into expected much beyond his fortune 
my smith did not want to take blame to herself and am most elder of throwing any on her husband 
but anne rumour 
2 5 5 could collect that their income had never been em to their style of living and that from the line there had been a great deal general and joint extravagance 
from his wife account of him she could discern mr smith to have been a man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong understanding 
much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him led by him and probably despised him 
mr elliott 
raised his marriage to great peace and to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without 
involving himself for with his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man and beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend probableﬁnances but on the contrary had been promptly and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the smiths accordingly had been minced 
the husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it 
hey had previously known embarrassment enough to try the friendship of their friends and to prove that mr elliott s had better not be tried 
but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known 
with a conscience in mr elliott regard more creditable to his feelings than his judgment mr smith had appointed him the execution of his will 
but mr elliott would not act and the difficulties and distressed which thin refusal had leaped on her in addition to the inevitable mutterings of her situation had been such a could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened to without corresponding indignation 
anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to urgent applications from mrs smith which all breathed the same story resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and under a cold civility the name

but there wan nobody to air in it 
5 elliott would do nothing and he could do nothing herself ally disabled from personal exertion by servants of italy wukmmfm no other by her went of money 
she had no in connexion to ruin her even with their counsel and could not afford to rescue the nuisance of the law 
thin was a cruel aggravation of actually frightened menus 
to feel that the ought to be in baker circumstance that a little trouble in the right place might do it and to fear that delay might be even viewing her chair war hand to bear 
it war on this point that the had hoped to engage anne good nicely with mr elliott 
she had previously in the anticipation of their marriage been very ve of long her friend by it 
but on being mutedthathecouldhavemadenomemptofthat nature since he did not even know her to he in bath rnsussron 
31 4 it immediately occurred that something might be done in her fever by the influence of the woman he loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest anne's feelings as far as the observances due to mr elliott character would allow when anne's refutation of the sun engagement changed the face of everything 
i while it took from her the reformed he of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way 
after listening to this full description of mr elliott anne could not but express some surprise at mrs smith's having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation 
a she had seemed to recommend and praise him i a cry dear 2 was mrs smith's reply there was nothing else to be done 
i considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet have made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him 
than if he had been your husband 
my heart boiled for you as i talked of happiness 
and yet he is sensible he is agreeable and with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless 
he was very unkind to his first wife 
hey were wretched together 
but she was too mount and guide for respect and he had never love her 
i was willing to hope that you must are better 
v anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him as made her shoulder at the idea of the misery which must have followed 
it was just possible that she might have been persuaded by lady cassel 
and under such a sun on which would have been most miserable in en time had disclosed all too late 
it was very desirable that lady vessel should be no longer deceived 
and one of the concluding arranges passion

a cart 
11 one went home to think over all that the had heard 
in one her feeling were relieved by this know age of mr elliott 
there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him 
he stood opposed to captain wanton in all hit own unwelcome obtrnl'veneu 
and the evil of his attention an night the immediate mischief he might have done wan coincided with mention an inclined perplexed 
pity for him was all over 
but 31 wan the only point of relief

she was concerned for the disappointment and lady vessel would be feeling 
for the mortiﬁcntionl which man be hanging over her father and finer and had all the silent of foreseeing many evil without knowing how to avert any one of them 
she was most than ill for her own knowledge of him 
she had never considered himself at entitled m mud for not slighting an old friend like me smith but here war a reward indeed springing from it 
mrs smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done 
could the knowledge have been extended through her family 
but thin wan a vain idea she must talk to lady unwell tell her consult g 
her and having done her best wait the event with it much composure at possible

and at noon at it became clear that there their name relations were not arrived with any views of accommodation in that home sir water and elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality and do the honour of it very well 
they were come to bath for a few days with mr grove and we at the white heart 
so much wan pretty anyone understood 
but till sir water and elizabeth were walking nasunsrou

or an explanation of come smiling hint of particular business which had been omtatiou-ly dropped by mary on well an of some apparent confusion as to whom their port convinced of 
he then found that it convinced of my mir-grove henrieua and captain caviller beside their two selves 
he gave her a very plain intelligible account of the whole 1 a narration in which the law a great deal foot characteristic proceeding 
the scene had received in at impelled by captain harville'a wanting to come to bath on business 
he had begun to talk of it a week ago 
and by way of doing something a shooting wan over charles prepared coming with him and my caviller had seemed to like the idea of it very much up an advantage to her husband 
but mary could not bear to be left and had made herself i 
unhappy about it 
that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense or at an end 
but then it had been taken up by his father and mother 
his mother had some old friend in bath whom the wanted to see 
it war thought a good county for henrietta to come and buy wedding other for herself and her till 
and in hurt it ended in being allall mother's pity that everything might be comfortable and eat to paint caviller 
and he and mary were included in it by way of general convenience 
they had arrived late the night before 
my caviller her children and captain brunswick remained with mr grove and louisa at us return 
aunt only surprise was that affair thou d be in forwarded enough for henrietta’e wedding-clothes to be talked of 
she had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as mute prevent the marriage from being near at hand 
but he learned from charge that 24 rnsmsrou

and that their marriage was likely to take place in i few month quite an noon loving 
and i very good living it war charles added only live-ind-twentymiles from uppercrou india in i very one country one part of nowhere 
in the centre of home of the best preserved in the kingdom surrounded by three great proprietor c more careful and jealous than the other 
and to two of the three at lent charlehayter might get i special recommendation 
not that he will value it as he ought he observed a charm it too cool about atoning 
that the worn of him i an extreme ay glad indeed a cried anne 
a particularly glad that thin should happen 
and that of two date who both deserve equal well and who have always been much good friends e plums prospect of one should not he driving those of the other 
that they should be no equal in their prosperity and comfort 
i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both for yet

there was always s such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves 
nothing ever happened on either side hint was not announced immediately 
we are quite near relations you know 3 and mr elliott too whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with 
even attention is due to mr elliott

i am not one of those who he left the reigning power to bow to the rising sun 
i 1 would not go for the sake of your father i should think it scandalous to go for the duke of his heir 
what is mr elliott tone

and in the last words brought is enquiringeyes from charles to herself 
charles and mary still talked on in the same style 
he half serious and hslfjesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she invariably serious renown wantonly opposing it and not omitting to make it known that however determined to go to condemn place herself she should not think herself very well used if they went to the play without her

probably far the lake of walking away from it soon afterwards and taking a nation with in barefaced delight by anne 
you have not been long enough in but aid he a to enjoy the evening panic of the place a oh i no 
the critical character of that nothing for me 
i am no card-player 
a you were not formerly i know 
you dixon use to like card but time makes man changes

to one no time leaf somebody else should come in the were obliged to move 
anne talked of being perfect ready and tried to look it 
but the felt that could anxiety have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair in preparing to quit the room the would have found in 1 her own agitation for her cousin in the very security of his affection shrewish to pity her 
their prepantlone however were wrapped cart 
alarming pounds were heard 
other suitor approached and the door we thrown open for sir walker nod mien idiot who enhance seemed to give a general chill 
anne felt iii inmate operation and wherever the looked iii iylnptome of the lame

after the water of a few minutes in laying the proper nothing the begin to give the invitation which was to comprise ill the remaining due of the mulgrovee

mention 
the truth was that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to undergo the importance of a man than air and appearance ll hire 
the put was nothing 
the pretend that captain weutworth would move thou well in her drawing-room 
the card was pointedly given and sir water and elizabeth arm and disappeared 
the interruption had been short though severe and eye and animation returned to foot of these they left in the door that them out but not to anne 
she could think only of the invitation the had with and amusement witnessed and of the manner in which it had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather than gratification of polite acknowledgment rather than acceptance 
she knew him the law again in by 
eyes and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept inch an offering an an atonement for all the insolence of the past 
her spirit sank 
he held the card in hit hand after they were gone an if ye considering it 
a only think of elizabeth including everybody i 
whispered mary very dimly 
a i do not wonder captain pennyworth in delighted 
you see he can not put the card out of hit hand 
anne caught his eye law his cheek 
glow and hit mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt and turned away that he might neither lee nor hear more to vex her 
the party separated 
the gentlemen hid their own punish the handle proceeded on their own linen and they met no more while anne belonged to them 
she wan comedy begged to return and dine and give them all the rent of the day but her pint had been so long exerted that at present the felt unequal to move and it only for home where he might be cure of being ii alert at she chose confusion

they were reckoning him an certain but with her it was a grain solicitude never appeared for ever minutes together 
he generally thought he would come because the generally thought he ought 
but it wan a case which the could not to shape into an active act of duty or discretion an inevitably to d the suggestion of very appetite feeling 
she only roused himself from the breeding of thin readers agitation to let mr clay know that the had been seen with mr elliott three hours after his being moved to be out of bath for having watched in vain for name intimation of the interview from the lady herself the determined to mention it and it seemed to her that there was guilt in my clay face an the licensed 
it was innocent cleared away in an instant 
but anne could imagine the read there the conecionaneal of heaven in by force complication of mutual trick or come overbearing authority of he been obliged to attend perhaps or half an hour to his lecturer and restriction on her design on in water 
she exclaimed 
however with a very tolerable imitation of nature

one day only had since anna conversation with my birth 
but a feather interest had proceeded and the vicar 
now no little touched by mr elliott conduct except by in effect in one quarter that it became a matter of course the next morning ill to defer her explanatory lit in river street

she had the kindest a good morning god her you i a from captain caviller but from him not a word you look 
he had planned out of the room without i look 1 she had only time however to move closer to the table where he had been writing when were heard returning 
the door opened it was himself f. he w their pardon but he had forgotten luck loves and instantly creating the room toshe writing table 
and moving with hit back towards my grove he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper 
placed it before anne with eye of glowing intently fixed on her for i time and mine collecting his gloves we again out of the room almost before my grove we 
aware of his being in it the work on instant 
persuasion 4 the revolution which one instant had made in anne was almost beyond expression 
the letter with scarce ton hardly audible to a miss a. e

while opposed to be writing only to coming brunswick he had been also addressing her i on the contents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her 
anything was possible anything might be deemed rather than suspected 
mrs grove had little arrangements of her own at her own table 
to their protection the must trust and sinking into the chair which he had occupied succeeding to the very spot where he had turned and written her eyes devoted the following words i can listen no longer in silence 
i must speak to you by such means as are within my reach

i am half agony half hope 
tell me not that i am too late that such precious feelings are gone forever 
i offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it eight years and a half ago

you alone have brought me to bath

but an if indeed a whether to join or to pain on laid nothing only looked 
anne could command himself enough to receive that look and not repnllively 
the checkwhich had been pale now showed and the movements which had hesitated were needed 
he walked by her tide

there could he only a most proper alacrity a most obliging compliance for public view 
and smiles reigned in and spirit dancpersuasion 
a 49 ring in private rapture 
in half a minute charles was at the bottom of noon street again and the other two proceeding together and soon word 
enough passed between him to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk where the war of conversation would make the present hour a indeed and prepare it for all the immortalised which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow 
there they exchanged a in those feelings and drove promises which had once he he seemed to secure everything but which had been followed b so many many years of division and estrangement 
here they returned again into the past more exquisite hasp yes perhaps in their union than when it had been set rejected 
more tender more tried more red in 3 knowledge of each others character truth and attachment more us to act more justified in acting 
and there as they only paced the gradual ascend heedless of every group around them seeing neither sauntering politician humbling housekeeper flirting girls nor nursery-maids and children they could indulge in those retrospection and acknowledgments and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the resent moment which were so poignant and so cases in interest 
all the little variations of the last week were gone through 
and of yesterday and to-day there could scarcely be an end 
she had not listen him 
jealousy of mr elliott had been the reading weight the doubt the torment 
that had begun to operate in the ve hour of first meeting hearing bath 
that had returned after a short suspension 
to ruin the concert 
and that had influence him in everything he had said and done 
or omitted to say and do in the last four-and-twenty hours 
it had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks 
or words or actions occasionally encouraged 
it 25 mum 
had been vanquilhcd at last thoaeaemimeotaaod the tone which had mob him while the walked with captain caviller 
and under the irresistible governing of which he and seized a sheet of paper and poured out his feelings 
of who 
he had then written nothing wan to be retracted or qualified 
he persisted in having loved none but her 
she had never been supplanted 
e never even believed himself to see her equal 
that much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge that he had been content unconsciously nay intentionally 
that he had meant forget her and believed it to be done 
he had imagined himself indifferent when he had only been angry 
and he had been just to her america because he had been a murderer from them 
her character wan now fixed on his mind ii perfection itself maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness 
but he wan obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercroaa had he learnt to do her attire and only at ye had be begun to demand himself 
at l me he had received lesson of more than one sort 
he putting admiration of mr elliott had at least roused him and the scene on the cook and at the caviller had fixed her superiority 
in preceding attempt to attach himself to loving grove the attempt angry pride he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible 
that he had not cared could not care for loving 
thou he till that day till the pleasure for reflection which for owed it he had not understood the effect excellence of the mind with which louisas cool d in ill bear a comparison or the perfect unrivalled hold it pondered over his own 
there he had learnt to distinguish between the model of principle and the ordinary of ill-will between the daring of heedleaaneu and the resolution of a collected mind 
there he had seen everything to persuasion 
25 l exult in his intention the woman he had lost 
and therebegnntodenlorediepride the folly thernadneaa of resentment 
which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way 
from that period he had become severe 
he had no sooner arm the honor and remorse attending the list few day of louisa accident no sooner begun to feel hired alive again than he had be to feel himself though alive not at liberty 
i found a did he that i was considered by caviller an engaged man that neither caviller nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment i wan rattled and locked

and at precisely at he became fully entitled of hit not caring for loud at all he most regard him

he would gladly weaken by any fair meant whatever feeling speculation

it was but a card party it was but a mixture of those who had never met before and those who met too often a commonplace business too numerous for intimacy me rail for variety

do not mistake me 
however 
i am not crying that he did not err in her advice 
it wan perhaps one of those eaten in which advice in good or had only an the event decides and for myself i certainly never should in any circumstance of tolerable similarity give much advice

ho con be in doubt of what followed 
when any two young people take it into their head to marry they are pretty sure by perseverance to carry their point be they ever to poor or ever persuasion 
2 5 7 no imprudent or ever no little likely to be necessary to each other ultimate comfort 
thin ma be bad nobility to conclude with but i believe it to truth 
and if such parties succeed how should a captain pennyworth and an anne elliott with the advantage of rarity of mind eon-domes of right and one independent fortune between them fail of bearing down every opposition 
they might in fact 
have home down a great deal more than they met with for there wan little to distress them beyond the want of gracious and warmth 
sir walker made no objection and elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned 
ca train pennyworth with five-and-twenty thousand pounds a 
and at high in hit profession ii merit and activity could place him wan no longer nobody 
he was now seemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish apendthrift baronet 
who had not had principle or ienaeenough to maintain himself in the situation in which providence had faced him and who could give his daughter at present t a small part of the ill 
of ten thousand pounds which most be here hereafter 
sir walker indeed though he had no affection for anne and no vanity altered to make him really ha on the occasion wan very far from thinking it a match for her 
on the contrary when he law more of captain pennyworth whim repeatedly b daylight and him well he was very much much by his 
parson claims and felt that ill 
superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balance against her superiority of rank 
and all this united by his welleounding name enabled sir water at lot to both his pen with a very good grace for the intention the marriage in the volume of honour 
the only one among them whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety wan lady quell 
anne knew that lady quell must be uttering tone 18 nnsmsron
