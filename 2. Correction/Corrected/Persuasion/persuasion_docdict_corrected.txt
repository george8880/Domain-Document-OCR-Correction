i walter elliot of kellynch hall s in somcraeuhirc was a man who for his own amusement never took up any book but the baronet 
there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a distrened one 
there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents 
there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt 
as he turned over the almost endless relations of the last century and there if every other leaf were powerless he could read his own history with an interest which never failed this was the page at which the favourite volume always opened

vanity wan the beginning and end of sir walter elliot’s character vanity of person and of situation 
he had been remarkably handsome in his youth and at ﬁfty-four wan still a very one man 
few women could think more of.t.heir penonal appearance than he did nor could the value of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society 
he considered the meeting of beauty at inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy 
and the sir walter e it who united these gifts 
wan the constant object of hit warmest t and devotion 
in good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment since to them he must have owed a wife rznsuasron 
3 of v or character in an thin deserved b his ownf'ylflaldeynelliot had been an excellent woman sensible and amiable whose judgment and conduct if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot had never required indulgence afterwards 
she had harboured or softened or concealed his failings and promoted his real rcspccuibility for seventeen years 
and though not the very happiest being in the world herself had found enough in her duties her friends and her children to attach her to life and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them 
three girls the two eldest sixteen and fourteen was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath an awful charge rather to conduce to the authority and guidance of a conceited silly father 
she had however one very intimate friend a sensible deserving woman who had been brought by many attachment to herself to settle close by her in the village of kellynch 
and on her kindness and advice lady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters 
this friend and sir walter did not marry whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance 
thirteen years had passed away since lady elliot’s death and they were still near neighbours and minute friends and one remained a widower the other a widow 
that lady russell of steady age and character and extremely well provided for should have no thought of a second marriage needs no apology to the public which is rather apt to be unreasonably diuonmted when a woman does marry again than when she does not but sir walter’s continuing in singlenesa requires explanation 
be it known then that sir walter like a good father having met with one or two private dish persuasion 
a appointment in very unreasonable applicationa himself on remaining single for his dear daughtzr’a take 
for one daughter his eldest he would really have given up anything which he had not been very much tempted to do 
elizabeth had succeeded at sixteen to all that will possible of her mother rightand connequence 
and being very handsome and very like himself her influence had always been great and they had gone on together most happily 
two other children were of very inferior value 
mary had acquired a little artiﬁcial importance by becoming an charles muugmve 
but anne with an elegance of mind and women of character which must have placed her high with in people of real understanding was nobody with either the or sister 
her word had no weight her convenience wan always to give way 
the was only anne 
to lady rune“ indeed she wan a more dear and highly valued god-daughter favourite and friend 
lady russell loved them all but it was only in anne that the could fancy the mother to revive again 
a few years before anne elliot had been a very pretty girl but her bloom had vanished early 
and as even in it height her father had found little to admire in her so totally different were her delicate features and miss dark eyes from his own 
there could be nothing in them now that she was founded and thin to excite his esteem 
he had never indulged much hope he had now none of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite worlt 
all equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth for mary had merely connected her with an old country family of respectability and large fortune and had therefore given all the honour and received none elizabeth would one day or other marry mitably

it wan no with elizabeth till the same handsome mine elliot that the had begun to be thirteen year ago and sir walter might be excused therefore in mr stating her age or at least be deemed only half a fool or thinking himself and elizabeth 18 blooming on ever amid the week of the good look of everybody else 
for he could plainly lee how old all the not of his family and acquaintance were growing

elizabeth did not quite equal her father in general contentment 
thirteen years had seen her miureel of kellynch hall reading and directing with a eelf-poeaeuion and indecision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than the was 
for three years had last been doing the honour and laying down the domestic law at home and leading the way to the chain and four and walking immediately after lady russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-room in the country

she had had a disappointment moreover which that book and especially the history lift her own family man ever present the remembrance of

he had not been known to them a a boy 
but soon after lady elliot’s death sir walter had taught the acquaintance and though his over had not been met with any want he had persevered in seeking it making allowance for the mode drawing-hack of youth 
and in one of their ring excursion to london when elizabeth was in her at bloom mr elliot had been forced into the introduction 
he was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the law 
and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable and every plan in his favour was confirmed 
he was invited to kellynch hall 
he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year 
but he never came 
the following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeable again encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come 
and the next tidings were that he won married 
instead of pushing hit fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the home of elliot he had purchased independence persuasion

quit tell such hall i 
the hint was immediately taken up or shepherd whose interest was involved in the city of sir walter’s refreshing and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would he done without a change of abode 
a since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate he had no temple he aid 2 in confessing his judgment to be entirely on that side 
it did not appear to him that sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a home which had such a character of hoepitnlitynnd ancient dignity to support 
in any other place sir walter might judge for himself 
and would he looked up to at regaining the mode of life in whatever way he might choose to model hil household 
sir walter would quit kellynch hall 
and after a very few day more of doubt and indecision the great reception of whither he should go wan settled and the 2m outline of thin important change made out 
there had been three alternatives london 
bath 
or another house in the country 
all anne s wishes had been forty liner 
a small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have lady runell's eociety still he near airy and still have the pleasure of persuasion 
r3 sometimes seeing the him and grave kellynch was the object of her ambition 
but the natural fate of anne amended her in having something very of tea from her inclination fixed on 
she disliked shy and did not think it agreed with her 
and bath wan to be her home 
sir walter had at lint thought more of london 
but mr s ride felt that he could not he trusted in london had been painful enough to did him from it end make bath preferred 
it was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament he might there be important at comparatively little expense 
two mterinl advantages of both over london had of course been given all their wei ht inmate convenientdiuanee from kellynch only fifty miles and lady runell’l spending some part of every winter there 
and to the very great unnfaction of lady russell those lines view-entire rojected change had been for bath 
sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither coneequence nor enjoyment by letting there 
lady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear anne’known wialm 
it would he too much to expect sir walter to descend into a full home in hit own neighbourhood 
anne herself would have found 
the niortlﬁcationl of it more than the foresaw and to sir walter’s feeling 
they must have been dreadful 
and with regard to anne’s dislike of bath the considered it up a prejudice and mistake mining hint from the circumstance of her having been three am at school there after her mother death 
and secondly from her happening to he not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which ill 
had agrwnrde spent there with herself 
lady russell wan fond of bath in about and disposed tothink itrnuu auitthern all 
indutoheryoung riend’t health by passing all the warm month with her rug piwasion 
it kellynch lodge every danger would be avoided 
and it was in fact i change which must do both health and spirit good 
anne had been too little from home too little teen 
her spirits were not high 
a larger society would improve them 
she wanted her to he more known 
the nndeainbleneu of any other house in the name neighbourhood for sir walter will certainly much strengthened by one part and a very material part of the scheme 
which had been happily engrafted an the beginning 
he was not only to quit his home but to ice it in the hand of other i trial of fortitude which stronger head than sir walter s have found too much 
kellynch hall wan to be let 
thin however was a proud secret not to be breathed beyond their own circle 
sir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his book 
mr shepherd had once mentioned the word 
advantage but never dared approach it again 
sir walter turned the idea of its being offered in any manner 
ford the list hint being drops of hit having inch an intention 
and it wan on my on the opposition of hit being ntaneoualy solicited by name most unexceptionable app leant on his warm terms and up a great favour that he would let it at i 
how quick come the recent for ap roving what we like 
lady russell had another excel ent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walter and his family were to remove from the country 
elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy which the wishes to see interrupted 
it was with a draught of mr shepherd 
who had returned after an unprolpenonl mnrria e to her father home 
with the additional borders of two children 
she wan i clever young woman who understood the art of pleasing 
the art of pleasing inn at persuasion 
i s kellynch hall 
and who had made herself in uncertahle w elliot a to have been already man there more than once in spite of all that lady rune who thought it a friendship quite out of place could hint of action and reserve 
lady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth and enabled to love her rather became she would love her than because elizabeth preserved it 
she had never received from her‘more than outward mention nothing beyond the observance of complaisance 
lad never succeeded in any point which ill 
wanted to marry again previous inclinalion 
she had been sadly very earnest in trying to get anne inns in the visit to london lende open to in the injustice and all die discredit of the eyes in lmngernenu which shut her out and on many lee-er occaliona had endeavoured or give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgment and experience 
but always in vain elizabeth would go her own way 
and never had he pushed it in more decided opponu'on to lady russell than in chin selection of my clay 
turning from the moiety of so deserving a line to bestow her edition and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility 
from duration mn clay w in lady runell’o minute a very unequal and in her character she believed i very dangerous companion 
and a removal that would leave my clay behind and bring i choice of more irritable intimatewithin min elliot reach was therefore an object of ﬁrm-rate importance 
r6 pnsuasrou 
that 3 
a mistake leave to observe sir walter laid mr shepherd one morning at kellynch hall at he laid down the newspaper that the potent picture in much in our favour 
thin peace will be turning all our rich naval oﬂicen aahore 
they will be all wanting a home 
could not be 1 better time sir walter for having a choice of tears very reasonable tenant many a noble fortune ha been made during the war 
if a rich admiral were to come in our way sir walter 
a he would be i very lucky man s head a sir walter 
a that is all i have to rest or a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him 
rather the greatest prizefof all let him have taken ever to many before 
hey she heard 
mr shepherd aughed no he knew he must at this and then added 
— a i palmer to observe sir walter that in the way of business gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with 
i have had a little knowledge of their method 
of doing butineu 
and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notion and are an likely to make desirable tenant nu any let of people one should meet with 
therefore sir walter what i would take leave to get it that if in consequence of any rumour 
getting abroad of our intention 
which must be contemplated a a possible thing became we know how difficult it in to keep the action and delight of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other 
consequence has its tax 
i john shepherd might conceal any family-matter that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me 
but sir walter elliot hazle eyes upon him which it may be very persuasion 
l 7 difficult to exclude 
and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad 
in the w option of which as i was going to observe since app actions will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to 
and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of real ng 
sir walter on my nodded 
but soon afterwards rising and placing the room he observed musically— there are few among the gentlemen the navy i imagine who would not be surprised to and these m in a house of this description a they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune 1 said mr clay for mrs clay was present her father had driven her over nothing being of so much use to mrs clay’s health as a drive to kellynch but i quite agree with my father in thinking s tailor might be a very desirable tenant 
i have known a good deal of the profession 3 and believe their lihenlity they are so neat and careful in all their ways l these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe 
everything in and about the house would be taken such excellence of l the gardens and shrubberies would he kept in almost as high order all they are now 
you need not be afraid miss elliot of put own sweet lower gardens being neglected 
as to all that rejoined sir walter coolly 1 supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it 
i am not particularly to favour a tenant 
the risk would be open to him of mum and few navy or chest or men of any other description can have had such a range 
but what restrictious i 8 persuasion 
might impose on the are of the plenum-grenade it another thing 
i am not fond of the idea 
of my chm 
a her being always a roach-kale 
and i should recommend miu elliot to on her guard with mpectro her power garden 
i am very little to grant 4 tenant of kellynch hall any stray inary favour i near you be he sailor or soldier 
after a than plate mr shepherd returned to ray 
— 2 in all they can there are embluhed use which make every thing plain and en between landlord and tenant 
our interest sir alter in in pretty safe hands 
depend anon me for taking care that no tenant but more than his jun rights 
i venture to hint that sir walter elliot can not be half jealous for his own at john shepherd will be for him

it seemed an if mr shepherd in thin anxiety to bespeak sir walter s good will towards a naval officers at tenant had been gifted with foresight 
for the very first application for the home war from an admiral croft with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter derision at barton 
and indeed he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent 
by the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make admiral croft wan a native of someneuhire who having acquired a very handsome fortune was within to settle in hit own country and had come down to aunt in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited him

accidentally hearing of the possibility of elpers'jasion

and anne after the little pause which followed added 
he in rear-admiral of the white 
he was in the trafalgar action and ll been in the east indies 
since 
he has been imagined there i believe several years 
then i take it for granted 1 observed sir walter 1 that his face in about an stranger s the coffee and capes of my livery mr shepherd hastened to assure him that admiral croft wan a very hale hearty well-looking man a little weather 
bates to be cure but not much and unite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour 
not likely to make the swollen difficulty about terms only wanted a comfortable home and to get into it at noon an possible 
knew he must pay for his 
convenience 
knew what rent a mdy-fumilhed house of that consequence might fetch 
should not have been surprised if sir walter had talked more 
had inquired about manor 
would be glad of the reputation certainly but made no great point of it 
said he sometimes took out a gun but never killed 
quite the gentleman 
mr shepherd wan eloquent on the subject pointing out all the circumncea ofthe adlniral'a union which made him peculiarly duh-able an a tenant 
e vain a married man and without children

he had seen mr croft too 
the was at mutton with the admiral nndhadheenpmentalmnatall thetirnethey were talking the matter over 
and a very well-epoken genteel shrewd lady he seemed to be continued he 
asked more queea'one about the house and term and take than the admiral himself and seemed more convenient with hulineal 
and moreover sir walter i found the week not quite unconnected in thin country any more than her husband

bless me 
how very odd 
i shall forget my own name soon i suppose 
a name that i am so very well acquainted with 
knew the gentleman no well by sight 
seen him a hundred time 
came to consult me once i remember about a tie-pan of one of his neighbour

quite unconnected 
nothing to do with the smﬂ'ord emily 
one wonder the names of many of our nobility become so common 
ai mr shepherd perceived that thin connexion of the croft did them no service with sir walter he mentioned it no more 
returning with all his zeal to dwell on the circnmamnceu more included in their favour 
their and number and fortune 
the high idea they had read of kellynch hall and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it 
relating it appear an if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness being the tenantelof sad alter elliot an extraordi taue coming so havebeenlu plead in thlea'l’ecret of sir after of the duel of a tenant 
it proceeded however 
and though sir walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think them infinitely too well i 
in being to rent it on the highest terms he was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the entreaty and autinrin'ng him to wait on admiral croft who still remained ll sanction and fix a day for the home being seen 
24 persuasion 
sir wdterwunotvery wile 
hatuillhelnd experience enough of the world to feel that a more unoh‘ ble tenant in all euenﬁalr than admiral cro bid fair to he could hardly offer 
so for went his depending 
and his vanity applied a little additional nothing in the admiral duration in life which was just high enough and not too high 
a i have let my home to admiral croft 1 would sound extremely well 
very much better than to any mere mr

a note of explanation 
an admiral epelltl his own consequence and at the nine time an never make a baronet look email 
in all their dealing and intercom-e sir walter elliot man ever have the proof cadence 
nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth but her inclination war growing no strong for a removal that 
she war happy to have it vexed and expected by a tenant at hand 
and not a word to spend decision was uttered by her 
mr shepherd was completely empowered to act 
and no sooner had each an end been reached than anne who had been a more attentive llltl‘nel to the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheek and at the walked along a favourite grove laid with a gentle high as few months more and be perhaps may be walking here

e war not mr wentworth the former curate of hunsford however miss loud a romancers may be but a captain f erick worth his brother who being made commanded in consequence persuasion 
25 of the action of st comings and not immediately employed had come into somersetshire in the number of 1806 
and having no parent living found a home for half a year at monkfonl 
he war at that time a remarkably one young man with a great deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancy 
and anne an extremely elma 
girl with gentleman modetty taste and feeling 
all the am no attraction on either side might have been enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love 
but the encounter of much faith recommendations could not fail 
they were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and deeply in love 
it would be difficult to lay which had seen highest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest the in receiving his declarations and proposed or he in having them accepted 
a short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short one 
trouble noon arose 
sir walter on being applied to without actually withholding his consent or ca ago it should never be gave it all the negative s great astonishment great coldneu great silence and a profeued resolution of doing nothing for his daughter 
he thought it a very degrading alliance 
and lady russell though with more temper and pardonahle pride received it as a most unfortunate one 
anne elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mind to throw herself away at nineteen 
involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself to recommend him and no 
hope attaining allluerme but in the chance of a most uncertain profession and no connexion to secure even hit farther rise in that profession would be indeed i throwing away which she grieved to think of l anne elliot so young 
known to so few to be matched off by a manner without alliance or fortune 
or rather united by him into a name of most wearing anxiety youth26 msunslox

he had always been lucky 
he knew he should he i will 
such confidence 
powerful in in own warmth and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it must have been enough for anne 
but lady uuell saw it very differently 
his sanguine temper and fearless of mind operated very differently on her 
she law in it but an aggravation of the evil 
it only added a dangerous character to himself 
he wan brilliant he wan headstrong 
lady russell had little not for wit and of anything approaching to impatience a honor 
she deprecated the connexion in every ght 
such opposition at these feelings produced was more than anne could combat 
young and gentle uohe wan it might at have been possible to withhold her ﬁlthcr'l ill-will though unattended by one kind word or look on the part of her lines 
but lad russell whom the had always loved and relied on so d not with such readiness of opinion 
and such tenderness of manner be continually advising her in vain 
she was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing indincreet improper hardly capable of success and not deserving it 
but it we not a merely selﬁsh caution under which she acted in putting an end to it 
had the not imagined henelf conaulting l’lll good even more than her own she could hardly have given him up 
the belief of persuasion 
2 7 being prudent and ielf-denying principally for li advantage was her chief consolation under misery of a parting a final ning 
and every consolation require for the he to encounter all the additional pain of opinions on his side mull unconvinced and unbendin and of his 
feeling him f ill used by in forced a reii’nquiahmenn he had left the country in consequence 
a few month had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance 
but not with a few months ended manners there of suffering from it 
her attachment and regrets had for a in time clouded every enjoyment of youth and an early foot of bloom and point had been their lasting effect 
more than seven year were gone iince thin little history of aorrowﬁrl interest had reached in close 
and time had softened down much perhaps supply all of peculiar attachment to him but he had been too dependent on time alone 
no aid had been given in change of place except in one visit to bath aoon afterthe rupture or in any novelty or enlargement of society 
no one had ever come within the kellynch circle who could bear a comparison with frederick wentworth i he wood in her memory 
no second attachment the only thorough 
natural happy and ancient cure at her lime of miss had been possible to the nice tone of her mind the faan'diuuaneu of her taste in the small spirit of the society around them 
she had been solicited when about two-und-twenty to change her name by the young man who not long afterward found a more willing mind in her you or litter and lady russell had lamented her a for charles muegmve was the eldest son of a man whose landed property and general importance were second in that country only to sir masters and of good character and appearance 
and however lady rnuell might have c 28 
mason 
asked yet for nothing more wluleannewnincreen the would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two no reqectahly removed from the and inquire of her father's house and settled an permanently hear herself 
but in thin cue anne had left nothing for advice to do 
end though ley russell 
a nailed up everwith hernwndilcretion neverwilheddiepmundone she began now to have the anxiety which harden on hopeless for manners being tempted by some man of talent and independence to enter a me for which the held her to be peculiarly ended by her warm affections and domestic habits 
they knew not each other opinion either in conmncy or in change on the one lendinglpointof anne’s conduct for the subject war never alluded to 
but anne at ceven-ind-twenty though very .151 
de from what the lad been made to think at nineteen 
she did not blame ley russell she did not blame herself for having been guided by her 
but she felt that were my young person in familiar circummncec to apply to her for councel they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchednels inch uncertain future good 
she wapenuaded that under every advantage of in approbation at home and every anxiety attending his pm cation all their probable fears delays and dilapntmenu the should yet have been i happier woman in maintaining the engagement that she had been in the sacrifice of it 
and this the fully believed had the usual share had even more than 11 ml uhare ofull ouch uoli' citudee and see been then without reference to the actual 1 of their case which an it happened 
would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could he reuomhly calculated on 
all his sanguine expectation all his confidence had been justiﬁed 
his genial end ardaur had seemed to force and to command his pmpemuc path 
he had very noon after their engagepensmsrou 
29 ment cased got employ and all that he had told her would follow had taken place 
he had diatingniahed himself and early gained the other up in rank and must now by lucceuive capturea have madeahandaome fortune 
she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority but the could not doubt his being rich 
and in favour of his 
company he had no man to believe him married 
how else uent could anne elliot have been 
how eloquent at cut were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment 
and a cheerful confidence in charity again that over-anxioua caution which seem to insist exertion and diurnal providence 
she had been forced into prudence in her youth the learned romance up the grew older the natural quest of an unnatural be nning 
it all these circumstances recollections and feelings she could not hear that captain wentworth’a i'lﬂel‘ was likely to live at kell ch without a revival of former pain 
and many a strong l and many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea 
she often told herself it was folly before the could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the croft and their business no evil 
she war auiated however by that perfect indifference and apparent unconacioueneu among the only three of her own friends the secret of the part which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it 
she could do justice to the mud purity of lad ruuell’s motives in this over thorpe of her father liubeth 
ll could honour all the better feelings of her calmness 
but the general air of opinion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung 
and in the event of admiral croft’s really taking kellynch hall the rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her of the part being known to those three only among her so runsmsrorr 
connexion by whom no syllable the believed would ever be whilperedﬁnd in the trultthatnmonghigthe brothers with whomhehadbeenreidinglud received any information of their than-lived engagement 
that brother had been long removed from the country in being a sensible man and moreover a single mm it the time the had a fond dependence on no human creatures having heard of it from him 
the miller s croft had then been out of england icoonrpanyin her husband on a foreign station end her own sister mary had been at school while all occurred 3 and never admitted by the pride of name and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge of it afterward 
with these oppose the hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the croft which with lady russell ltill reddent in kellynch and mary fixed only three miles oil must be anticipated need not involve any particular awkwardness 
theater 17 
m the morning a invited for admiral and mr croft’t ieeing ellynch hall anne found it met natural to take her almost daily walk to lady ruuell’a and keep out of the way till all was over 
when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had mind the opportunity of seeing them 
thin meeting of the two rtiel proved highly natiofactory and decided the who e business at once 
each lady wan previoutly well disposed for in agreement and saw nothing therefore but good manners in the other 
and with regard to the gentlemen there was inch an hearty good humour such an open muting libemlity on rsnsussrou 
31 the admiral side as could not but inﬂuence sir walter who had besides been altered into his very best and most wished behaviour by mr shepherd assurances of his ‘ng known by report to the admiral as a model of good breeding 
the house and grounds and furniture were approved the croft were approved terms time every thing and every body was right 
and mr shepherd’s clerks were set to work without there having been a single liminary difference to of a that 
this in nature showeth.” sir walter without hesitation declared the admiral to be the finest-looking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to by that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where 
and the admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife as they drove back through the park 
i thought we should soon come to a deal my clear in spite of what they told us at barton 
the baronet will never set the james on are but there seems no harm in him 
reciprocal compliments which would have been esteemed about 2 ll 
the croft were to have possession at michaelmas 
and as sir walter proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month there was no time to be lost in making every dependant arrangement 
lad russell convinced that anne would not be allow to be of any use or any importance in the choice of the house which they were going to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she 
might convey her to bath herself after christmas 
but having engagements of her own which must take her from well much for several weeks she was unable to give the fun invitation she wished and anne 32 mason 
thonghdmtingthepodrlehmofswaherinaﬂ thewhinghnoand mforegoallthe inﬂuenoenneetandao oftheamumnalnootha intbeeountry didnotthinkthat evaytbingoonidemd something occurred however to give her a different duty 
mary often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming anne when anything was me matter was indisposed 
and foreseeing hint she should not have a day health all the autumn entreated or rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to one to us to 
courage and bear her on as long lhtppflmtonld want her instead of gain i can not possibly do without one was mary’maoning 
and elizabeth reply wan then i am gale anne had better stay for nobody will want her in my 
to be claimed at a good though in an improper at e in at 
lent better than being rejected an no good at all 
and anne glad to be thought of some use glad to have anything marked out an a duty and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country and her own dear country readily a need to my 
this invitation of april removed all lady russell difficulties and it was con nently noon settled that anne should not go to bath ti l lady russell took her and that all the interesting time should be divided between a cross cottage and kellynch lodge 
so far a wan perfectly right 
but lady unwell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it hunt on her which was mi'i clay'being engaged to go to bath with sir walter and elizabeth an a most important and valuable assistant to the persuasion 
33 latter in ill the business before her 
lady russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered grieved and feared 
and the affront it contained to anne in mrs clay s being of so much use while anne could be of none was i very sore aggravation 
anne herself was become hardened to such nﬂ'ronu but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement uite st keenly a lady russell 
with a great deal is quiet observation and a knowledge which she often wished less of her father s character the was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible 
she did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind 
mrs clay had freaks and a projecting tooth and s claims wrist which he was continually making severe remarks no in her absence 
but the was young and certainly it either well-looking and possessed in an acute mind and insidious pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merelypersnnal might have been 
anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perc liable to her sister 
she had little hope of success t elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself should never she thought have reason to reproach her for giving no warning 
she spoke and seemed only to offend 
elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantly answered for each party perfectly knowing their situation 
a mrs clay said she warmly 1 never forgets who she is 
and an i am rather better acquaian with her sentiments than you can be i can assure you that upon the of marriage they are particularly nice and that she reprobated all inequality of condition and rank more 34 nasuasrou 
money than most people 
and at to my father i reallyalmldnothave thoughtthathev/hohaakept himoelflin elolnngfor our lkel need be suspected now 
if ll clay were a very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her to much with me 
not that anything in the world i am sure would induce my father to make a degrading match but he might be rendered unhappy 
but mr mu cla who with all her merits can never have no reckon tolerany melt i really think or a clear ma be stab in hire iii perfect safety 
poor would you had never heard my father speak of her personal mi fortune though i know you must fifty times 
that tooth of hen and those freckle 
freckle do not disgust me to very much a they do him 
i have known a nice not materially dilﬁgured by a few but he abominatea them 
you must have heard him notice on clay’a ﬁecklea 
a there is hardly any personal defect replied anne 1 which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to 
i think very differently answer elizabeth shortly 
an ample manner may out off handsome features but can never alter plain ones 
however at any rate at i have a great deal more at stake on thin point than anybody else can have i think it rather unnecessary in you to he advising me 
anne had done 
glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless of doing good 
elizabeth 
though resuming the suspicion 
might yet be made observant by it 
the last choice of the four carriage-hone war to draw sir walter min elliot and mrs clay to bath 
the party drove off in very good spirits 
sir walter prepared with condeacending how for all the selected tenants and concern who might have had a hint to pnsussron 
35 how themselves and anne walked up it the same time in a sort of desolate tranquillity to the lodge where he was to spend the hint week 
her friend was not in better lpll'lll than herself 
lady russell felt this break-up of the family exceedingly 
their respectability was as dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become recious by habit 
it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds and still worse to anticipate the new hsnds they were to fall into 
and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of to altered i village and be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft lim arrived she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up anne 
accordingly their removal was made together and anne was set own at uppercrou cottage in the list stage of lady russell’s va. 
uppercrou was a moderate-sized village which a few years back had been completely in the old english style containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the women and labourers 
the mansion of the squire with its high walls great gates and old trees substantial and modernised and the compact tight panonage enclosed in its own neat garden with a volume and a partner trained round it easements 
but upon the marriage of the young require it had received the improvement of a farm-house eleveted into i cottage for his residence and uppercrou cottage with its viranda french windows and other prettinessel was quite as likely to catch the travellers eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the great house about a quarter of a mile farther on 
here anne had often been staying 
she knew the ways of uppercrou as well as those of kellynch 
the two families were so continually meeting so much in the habit of running in and out of each other house at ill 36 newnsrou 
honmthnitwunthereurpﬁcm her toﬁndmary alone 
but being alone her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course 
though better endowed than the elder liner mary had not assert undertttnding nor temper 
while well and happy and properly attended to the had great humour and excellent spirits 
but any in titlon trust her completely 
she had no resources or solicitude 
and inheriting a conﬁdenhle isle of the elliot telf-importonce wet very prone to add to evil other times that of fancying himself neglected and ill used 
in person the want inferior to both sisters and had even in her bloom only reached the die it of being 
a one girl 
she was now lying on the bed tops of the pretty little drawing-mom 
the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing thahhy under the influence of four manner and two children 
and on anne's appearing greeted her with 
a so you are come at him 
i began to think i should never see you 
i am to ill i can hardly speak 
i have not seen a creature the whole morning 
a i am sorry to and you unwell replied anne 
a you tent me such a good account of yourself on thursday 
yet i made the heat of it 
i always do but i was very far from well at the time 
and i do not think i ever want to ill in my life at i have been all this morning very unfit to he left alone i am tore 
so polite i were to he size of a sudden in tonic dread ul way and not able to ring the bell i so lady russell would not get out 
i do not think the hat been in this house three time this turnrner 
anne said what was proper and enquired after her husband 
a 0h 
charles it out shooting 
i have not seen him since seven o'clock 
he would go though i told him how ill i was 
he said he should not stay persuasion 
3 7 outlong 
but he hat never come back and now it in alrnottone 
iamreyoui have not seen a too thin whole long morning 
you have had your little by with you i a yes an long an i could bear their noise 
but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good 
little charles does not mind i word i any and walter it growing quite as bad 
a well you will noon be better now a replied anne cheerfully 
you know i always cure you when i come 
how are your neighbour at the great home e 
i can give you no account of them 
i have not seen one of them to-day except mr mangrove 
who just stopped and spoke through the window but without getting all hit home 
and though i told him how ill i was not one of them have been near me 
it did not happen to suit the mind grove i suppose and they never at themselves out of their way 
you will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone 
it in early 
a i never want them i assure you 
the talk and laugh a great deal too much for me 
oh 
sure i am in very unwell 
it was quite unkind of you not to come on thunday.” 1 my dear mary recollect what comfortable account you lent me of yourself 
you wrote in the cheerful manner and aid you were perfectly well and in no hurry for me 
and that being the case you must be aware that my will would be to remain with lady russell to the last and besides what i felt on her account i have all been so busy have had it much to do that i could not very conveniently have left well much sooner 1 ear me 
what can jon possibly have to do 2 1 a great many things i assure you 
more than i can recollect in a moment 
but i can tell you some 
i 38 persuasion 
hevebeen making i duplicate of the dialogue of my other books and i have been several times the men with mackenzie trying to understand and make him under which of elizabeth plants are for lady russell 
i have had all my own little con 
term to arrange book and music to divide and all my trunkno reproach from not having understood in time what wan intended as to the wagon and one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying nature going to almost every house in the parish up a son of takelenve.. i was told that they wished it 
but all these things took up i great deal of time 
a oh well i 
and after a moment's pause 1 but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the plea yenerday 
did you go then 
i have made no enquiries because i concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party 
oh yes 
i went 
i was very well yesterday 
nothing at all the matter with me till thin morning 
it would have been strange if i had not gone 
do i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party 
nothing remarkable 
one always known beforehand what the dinner will be and who will be there 
and it it to very uncomfortable not having a carriage of once own 
mr and mr mangrove took me and we were in crowded 
they are both go very large and take up so much room 
and mr mangrove always rises forward 
so there was i crowded into the back meat with henrietta and louisa 
and i think it very likely that my illness to-day may be owing to it a little farther perseverance in patience and formed cheerfulness on anne’s aide produced nearly a cure on to 
she could noon at upright on the sofa and begun to hope the might be able to leave it by dinnerpersuasion 
39 time 
then forgetting to think of it she was at the other end of the room beautifying a note 
then she ate her cold melt 
and then she war we enough to i little walk 
a where shall we go 
a said the when they were ready 
i you will not like to call it the game house before they have been to lee you 
a i have not the smallest 
objection on that account a replied anne 
i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as men and the miss mungmves 
a 1 
oh 
they ought to call upon you as soon as possible 
they ought to feel what in due to you an m deter 
however we may as well go and sit with them a little while and when we have got that over we can enjoy our walk anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly in kent 
but she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing that though there were on each side continual subjects of offence neither family could now do without it 
to the got home accordingly they went to sit the full half hour in the old-fuhioned square parlour with a small pet and thinking floor to which the present daughter of the house were gradually giving the proper sir of confusion by a grand piano-forte and a harp ﬂower-stands and little tables placed in every direction 
oh 
could the original or the portrait 
against the wainscot could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue susan have seen what wan going on have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and greatness 
the portraits themselvel seemed to be staring in astonishment 
the musgroves like their houses were in a state of alteration perhaps of improvement 
the father and mother were in the old english style m the young people in the new 
mr and mr musgron were a l 40 persuasion 
ve good sort of less 
friendly and irritable not much educated audit at all elegiint 
ll‘oh'eh children had more modern mind 
and manners 
there was a numerous family 
but the only two grown up sex in charles were henrietta and louisa young keys of nineteen and twenty who had brought from a school at enter all the usual stock of accomplishments and were now like thousand of other young ladies living to he fashionable happy and merry 
their dress had every advantage their faces were rather pretty their spirits extremely good their manners embarrassed and lament 
they were of consequence at home and iamuritea abroad 
anne always contemplated them at some of the happiest creature of her acquaintance but still avoid as we all are by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyment 
and envied them nothir‘tlg but that seemingly perfect good understanding an agreement together that good-humoured mutual affection of which she had known so little hero self with either of her sisters 
they were received with great cordiality 
nothing seemed amiu on the side of the great house family which was general at anne very well knew the lean to blame 
she half hour wan chatted sway pleamntly enough 
and she war not at all surprised at the end of it to have their walking party joined by both the mind mulgroveu at mary’s particular invitation

none had not wanted this visit to uppercua to learn that a removal from one net of people to another though at a distance of only three miles will often include a total change of conversation opinion and idea 
she had never been staying there before without being struck by it or without wishing that otherelliota could have her advantage in seeing how unknown or unconlidered there 
were the affair which at kellth hall were treated an of such eoenl publicity and providing interest 
yet with all this experience the believed the man 
now submit to feel that another less in the art of knowing our own nothing beyond our own circle wan become necessary for her 
for certainly cumin 11 the did with a heart full of the subject which had en completely occu ying both how in kellynch for many weeks the had seated rather more curiosity and ayrnputhy than the round in the ieparntc but very rimilar remarks of mr and mr mangrove so marianne sir w tear and your sister are gone 
and what it of bath do you think they will settle in 
.auclnthis without much waiting for an answer 
or in the young ladies addition of l hope we shall be in bath in the winter 
but remember papa if we do go we must be in a good duration none of your queen 8 uneasy for us 
or in the anxious supplement from any of 
just upon my word i shall be pretty well all 
when you are all gone away to be happy at bath 
she could only resolve to amid ruch aelf-delmion in frame and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly lympathiaiog friend at lady russell 
the mr mulgrovel had their own game to guard 4 2 persuasion 
and to delay their own horses dogs and news to engage them and the females were fully occificdfl'i all the other common object of homelreepiog na'ghhoun dreu dancing and music 
she acknowledged it to be very finding that every little local commonwealth ihould dictate its own master of dinooune 
and hoped ere long to become a not unworthy member of the one the was now tnoaplanted into 
with the prospect of leading at least two month at i’hei’ci'di 
it w highly incumbent on her to clothe her ima notion her memory and all her idea in a much of ppercrou up she had no dread of then two months 
mary me not it repulsive and unﬁlterly an elizabeth nor to inacce-the to all innocence of hen 
farther was there anything among the other com nent part 
of the cottage inimical to comfort 
he wan always on friendly permit her brother-in-law 
and in the children who loved her nearly ii well and repeated her a great deal more than their mother she had an object of interest amusement and whole-om exertion 
charles mangrove was civil and agreeable 
in sense and temper he was undoubtedly inferior to his wife but not of powers or conversation or grace to make the past as they were connected together at all a dangerous contemplation 
though at the lame time anne could believe with lady russell that a more equal match might have greatly improved him 
and that a woman of real undermnding might have given more consequence to ill 
carter and more ueefulneu rationality and elegance to hit habit and pursuits 
a it was he did nothing with much zeal but sport 
and his time was otherwise trilled away without benefit from bookcase or anything else 
he had very good spirits which never ieemed much affected by his wife occasional lownel bore with her unrealonablcnm sometimes to anne’s wuasion 
43 admiration and upon the whole though there war very often a little diugreernent in which the had sometimes morerhuethanuhewinhed heing appealed to both parties they might put for a happy couple 
they were a way perfectly agreed in the want of more money and i strong inclination for a handsome present from his father 
but here an on most topics he had the superiority for while mary thought it a great than that such a t was not made he always contended for his far i having many other safe for ‘llil money and a right to mend it us be liked 
as to the management of their children he henry war much better than hit wife and his practice not no bad 
i could manage them very well if it were not for mary interference wan what anne often heard him lay and had a good deal of faith in 
but when litteniug in turn to mary reproach of a charles la the children do that i can not get them into any of her 6 the never had the intellect temptation to lay a very true 
one of the lean 
agreeable circuit of her residence there wan her being treated with too much confidence ball and no too much the secret of the complaint of each house 
known to have nine influence with her lines they wan continually requelted or it lean receiving hints to exert it beyond what was amiable 
a i wish you could penua e mary not to always fancy g herself ill was charlet’u language 
and inn an ppy mood thus spoke mary i do believe if charles were to see me dying he would not think there war anything the matter with me 
i am sure anne if you would you might persuade him that i really am very ill 
a great deal worse than i ever owu 
mary'declaration war 
i hate tending the children to the great home though their grandpapa ll d 44 nesmsrou 
always wanting to see them for the humour and indulge them to such i degree 
and given them to much trash and sweet things that the are our to come back pick and group for the rent of the day 
and mr mangrove took the list opportunity of being love with anne to my 1 oh i mine anne i can not help wishing mn charles had a little of your method with that children 
they are quite different 
nature with you 
but to measure in general they are no spoil it in a pity you can not put your litter in the way of managing they are a one healthy children s ever were seen poor little dear 
without partiality 
but my charles known no more how they ihould be treated 
l bleu rue 
how troubleeome they are sometimes 
i nature you miss anne it prevent my wishing to to them it our home it often at i otherwioe ehould 
i believe my charles it not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener 
but you know it ll very bad to have children with one that one in obliged to be checking every moment 
do n't do this a and do n't do that 
a or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than in good for them 1 she had this communication moreover from mary 
a mr mangrove think all her servant to lady that it would be high union to call it in question 
but i am sure without exaggeration that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid instead of being in their business are gadding about the village all along 
i meet them wherever i go 
and i declare i never go twice into my uurlery without seeing something of them 
if emma were not the truan'eet oteadiest creature in the world it would be enough to spoil her 
for she tells me they are away i tempting her to take a walk with them 
a and on a muegrove’l ride it was a i make 3 rule of never interfering in any of my daughter-in-la’w'l eon.ceml for i know it would not do 
but i shall tell you persuasion 45 miss anne because you may be able to set things to right 
that i have no very good opinion of my charlee’u nursery-maid i hear mange stories of her 
the in away upon the sad 
and from my own knowledge i can declare the in such a line-dressing lady that the in enough to ruin any servant the come near 
my charles quite mean by her i know 
but i just ve you this hint that you may be upon the watch 
use if you see anything miss you need not be afraid of mentioning it again 
it won mary s complaint that my mangrove wuveryapt not to give her the presence that her due when they dined at the great home with other family 
and the did not lee any remains why the wutobeconlidered to much it home one lose her place 
and one day when anne wan walking with only the mind mulgrovee one of them after talking of unit people of rank and jealousy of rank laid 1 i have no scruple of observing to you how noneensical some persons are about their place become in the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it 
but i with anybody would give mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if the were not to very tenncioua especially if she would not be always of putting herself forward to take place of emma 
nobody doubts her right to have prescience of mr but it would be more becoming in her not to be all intending on it 
it ll not that man can about it the lent in the world but i know it is taken notice of by many per 
note how was anne to let all these matters to rights 
she could do little more than linen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each to the other 
give them all hint of the forbearance neceuary between such near neighbours and make those hint broadest which were meant for her linter’e beneﬁt 
46 persuasion 
in another reapectyherviait began and proceeded very well 
her own spirits improved by change of lace and rub cut by being removed three miles from kellynch 
mary ailments lessened by having a constant no notion and their daily inrereoune with the other fam yet since there wan neither euperior affection conﬁdence nor employment in the cottage to be interrupted by it wan rather an advantage 
it war certainly carried near or far as possible for they met every morning a hardly ever spent an evening minder 
but the believed they ihould not have done to well without the eight of mr and mr muegrvve’l able form in the usual places or without the talking laughing and singing of their daughters 
he played a great deal better than either of the mind muegrovee but having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parents to sit by and fancy themselves delighted her performance wan life thought of only out of civility or to regret the other as the war well aware 
she knew that when the played the was giving pleasure only to herself 
but this was no new sensations 
excepting one short period of her life the had never since the age of fourteen never since the loan of her dear mother known the happiness of being listened to or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste 
in music she had been always used to feel alone in the world 
and mr and mr mulgrnve’e fond partiality for their own daughters performance and total indifference to any other person gave her much more pleasure for their lakes than mortification for her own 
the stay at the great home war enmetimee increased my other company 
the neighbourhood was not large but the murgroves were visited by everybody and had more dinner-parties and more called more visitor invitation and by chance than any other family 
hey were more completely popular 
march 47 thegirllwerewild for dancing 
and the evening ended occasionally in e nnpremeditated little had therewulfamilyofcouainlwithinawnlkofu emma in lea aﬂlnent circumuncee who deyzndmn the mugmveeforall theirplunuea theywouldcome at any time or help to play at anything or dance anywhere 
and anne very much preferring the office of militia to i more active poet played country dance to them by the hour together

and now anne’s heart man he in kellynch again 
a beloved home made over to them 
all the precious room and furniture m and he running to own other eyes and offer limbs less could think of much clue on the 24th of september 
and she had thin lympathetic touch in the evening from mary who on having occasion to note down the day of the month exclaimed dear me in not thin the day the croftwere to come to kellynch 
i am glad i did not think of it before 
how low it make me i 
the croft took union with true naval alertness and were to be used 
mary deplored the necessity for herself 
a nobody knew how much the should suffer 
she ihould put it of an long an she could 
a but was not easy till the had talked charles into driving her over on an early day and war in a very animated comfortable at 
of imaginary agitation when she came back 
anne had very sincere rejoiced in there being nomeanlofhergoing 
she ever toeeethe croft and was glad to be within when the visit was returned 
they came the master of the house viii 48 persuasion 
notlthome butthetwoslltenwere together 
and as it chanced that mrs croft fell to the share of anne while the admiral sat by mary and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little ha i 
she was well able to watch for a likeness and if it fair eyed her in the features to catch it in the voice drain the turn of sentiment and expression 
mrs croft 
though neither tall nor fat had a sameness upright and vigour of form which gave importance to her person 
she had bright dark eyes good teeth and altogether an agreeable face 
though her reddened and wather-beaten complexion the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eightand-thirty 
her manners were open easy 
and decided like one who had no distrust of herself and no doubts of what to do 
without any approach to coarseness however or any want of good humour 
anne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration towards herself in all that related to kellynch and it pleased her especially a she had satisfied herself in the very warm half minute in the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest s m in of any knowledge or susan in on mrs croft’s idlemto give a bias of an sort 
she was quite easy on that head and consequent y full of enough and courage till for a moment electriﬁed by mrs cross as suddenly saying 
a it was you and not your sister i and that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this country 
anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing 
but the age of emotion she certainly had not 
a perhaps you may not have heard that he in married 1 added mrs croft 
she could now answer as she ought 
and viii happy persuasion 
49 to feel when mr croft s next word explained it to be mr wentworth of whom the spoke that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother 
she immediately felt how reasonable it was that mrs croft should be thinking and speaking of edward and not of frederick 
and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former nei libonr’s present state with proper interest 
he rose 
was all tranquillity 
till just as they were she heard the admiral ay to mary 
— a e are expecting a brother of my cross here soon 
i dare any you know him by me 
he was cut short by the eager attack of the little boys clinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go 
and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pocket am to have another moment for wishing or recollecting what he had begun anne was left to persuade herself an well an she could that the name brother must still be in question 
she could not however reach such a degree of certainly as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house where the croft had previously been calling 
the folly of great house were to spend the evening of this day the cottage 
and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot the coach wan beginning to be listened for when the youngest mice ntgrove walked in 
that she was coming to apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves war the first black idea 
and ma was quite ready to be affronted when louisa made a 1 right by saying that the only came on foot 
to leave more room for the harp which was bringing in the carriage 
a mud i will tell you our reason 1 she added and all about it 
i am come on to give you notice that so nasuasrou 
papa and mamma are out of appear a thieevening 
mamma 
the in thinking to much of poor richard and agreed it dbebeettohavetheharp for it seems to assure her more than the comforts 
i will tell you why the in out of spirits 
hen the croft called his morning they called here afterwardl did not they vi they happened to ray that her brother captain entworth 
ll just returned to england or paid or something and in coming to see rh almost directly 
and most unluckily it came into mamma’a head when they were gone that wentworth or something very like it was the name of poor richard plain at one time 
i do not know when or where but a great while before he died poor fellow and upon looking over his letters things the found it war no and it perfectly ante that thin moat be the very man and her head it quite full of it and of poor richard i so we must all be an merry ii we can that the may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things the real crrcumnancea of thin pathetic piece of family hintery were that the muagrovea had had the ill fortune of a very uoubleaome hopeleu son and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year 
that he had been sent to sea because he wan stupid and unmanageable on shore 
that he had been very little cared for at any time by bit family though quite at much at he deserved 
seldom hard of and scarcely at all regretted when the intelligence of hit death a road had worked in way to uppercrou two year before 
he had in fact though his line were now doing all they could for him by calling him a poor richard 1 been nothing better than a thick-headed unfeeling unproﬁtable dick mangrove who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the alleviation of hit name living or dead 
he had been several years at m and had in the persuasion 
5 l eonneofthoee removal which all midnhipmen are single my ielleuchmi i have ca no wish to or been six mori’tnli on mac-ﬂu frederick wentworth’l frighten the agonies 
and from the acacia he had under the influence of his captain written the only two learn which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of hit abet-nee 
that in to lay the only two diainterened letter all the mist had been mere i licationl for money 
to each letter he had spot well ofhie rapt-in 
but yet no little were they in the habit of attending to inch latter no unobeervant and injurious were they i to the name of men or chips that it had made scarcely any impression at the time 
and that my mugmve should have been suddenly muck thin very day with a recollection of the name of wentworth an connected with her son seemed one of those extraordinary buzz of mind which do sometimes occur 
she had gone to her letters and found it all as the supposed 
and the perpetual of these letters after so long an interval her poor ion gone for ever and all the strength of his faults forgotten had accepted her spirit exceedingly and thrown her into greater grief for him than ill 
had known on lint hearing of his 
death 
mr mangrove wan in a lesser degree affected likewise 
and when they reached the cottage they were evidently in want rest of being listened to new on thin object and afterwards of all the relief which cheerful companions could give 
to hear them talking so much of captain wentworth repeating his name to often puzzling over put can an at last ascertaining that it night that it proudly would turn out to be the very same captain wentworth whom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back from clifton 
a very one young man

very few day 
more and captain wentworth w known to be at kellynch and mr mangrove had called on him and come back warm in ma place and he was engaged with the croft to dine at speech by the and of another week 
it had been 2 gm dinppcinunent to mr mulgrovc to and that no earlier day could be fixed to impatient was he to about his gratitude by being ca min wentworth under his own roof and welcoming him to all that wan nmngeu 11nd but in his calling 
but a week must pass 
only a walk in anne’s reckoning and then the supposed the muutmcet 
london the began with that she can 4 feel secure even for a week 
captain wentworth made a very early return to mr mulgmve't civility and the wan all but calling thenin rnsmsron

learnt they must inevitath have found him when they were stopped by the eldest boys being at that moment brought home in consequence of i had fall 
the child iituation put the will entirely aide 
but she could not heat of her name with indiﬂ'erenee even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account he collar-hone was found to he dielocated 
and such injury received in the back an roused the mot 
alarming in it wan an afternoon of times 
my anne had everything to do at once 
the apothecary to send for the father to have pursued and formed the mother to support and keep from hynerice 
the servants to control the youngest child to banish and the poor suffering one to attend end ooothe 
besides lending at soon as the recollect it proper notice to the other house which brought her an accession rather of frightened enquiring cnmmnionc than of very useful anietantu 
her brother s return wan the in comfort 
he could take best care of hit wife 
and the second blessing was thean-ival of the apothecary 
till he came and had examined the child their appnhenlionl were the worse for being vague 
they spend great injury but knew not where 
but now the collar-hone wan anon placed and though mr robinson felt and felt and moved and looked grave and polite low word 
both to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the bent and to he able to it and eat their dinner in tolerable clue of mind 
a then it was just before they parted that the two young aunt were able to far to direct from their s free state at to give the information of captain entworth’u viit 
musing over minutes behind their father and mother to endeavour to express perfectly deiighted they were with him how much hand54 pbs‘uasion

how glad they had been to hear papa invite him to my dinner how sorry when he did it was quite out of his power and how glad again when he had promised to reply to papa and mamma farther pressing invitation to come and dine with them on the morrow 
actually on the morrow 
and he had promised it in so plans i answer at if he felt all the motive of their attention but ii he ought

the came story and the name raptum were repeated when the two girl came with their father through the room of the evening to make inquiries 
and mr ulgrove no longer under the east matineeabout hit heir could add hll conversation and praise and hope there would be now no occasion for putting captain wentworth off and only he sorry to think that the cottage party probably would not like to leave the little boy to give himthemeetin 
oh 
no 
up to leaving the little boy both her and mother were in much too snug and recent alarm to hear the thought 
end anne in the joy of the scrape could not help adding her warm pmtenatione to theirs 
charles mangrove indeed nfterwardl showed more of inclination 6 the child going on to well and he wished to much to be introduced to captain wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening 
he would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour 
but in thin he was eagerly opposed by his 
wife with a 0h 
no indeed charles 
can not hear to have you go away 
only think if anything should happen 2 
pensumou 
39 the child had a good night and we 
going on well the next day 
it must be a work of time to ascertain that no inquiry had been done to the epine 
but mr opinion and nothing to increased alarm and charles mungmve began come uently to feel no necessity for longer conceal 1 child wan to be kept in bed and amused a quietly at possible 
but what wan there for a father to do 
thin was quite ferrars came and it would be highly abound in him who could be of no name at home to shut himself up 
his father much 
wished him to meet captain wentworth a there being no inﬂicient reason against it he ought to go 
and it ended in his making a. bold public declaration when he came in from shooting of his meaning to dress direct and dine at the other home 
nothing can be going on better than the child a laid he 
a is i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me quite right 
your litter being with on my love i have no temple at all 
you would not like to leave him ynnnelf but you see i can be of no use 
anne will send for me if anything in the matter hnnhandn and wives generally understood when oppouition will he vain 
mary knew doom charlee’a manner of speaking that he in quite determined on going and that 
it would be of no one to tease him 
she said nothing therefore till he wan out of the room 
but a noon us there wan only anne to hear

you who have not a motherly feelings are a great deal the properer person

it will be i great deal better than leaving him with only jemima 
only i will certainly go

an excellent thought of your indeed anne 
i will go and tell charles and get ready directly 
you can send for nl you know 
1 moment'l notice if anything is the matter 
but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you 
i should not go you may he sure if i did not feel quite at one short 
my dear child 
the next moment she was stopping at her husband's drawing-room door and a anne followed her up in the war in time for the whole conversation which began with mary dying in a tone of great exultation 
i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more see at home than you are 
if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child i should not be able to de him to do anything he did not like 
anne 17 may 
anne undertakes to nay at home and take cure of him 
it in anne’s own soul and no i dull go with you which will be a great deal better for i have not dined at the other house iince tneodn 
this in very kind of anne 1 was her huahnnd’l 58 mum 
newer and i should beveryglnd to have you go 
hutitneemntherhnrdtlntnhenhauldheleﬁnthome by herself 
to nun our sick child 
anne was now i 
hand to take up her own entree and the sincerity of her manner being noon sufficient to convince him where conviction me it lean very agreeable he had no farther ucrupleo s to her being left to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the evening when the child might be 1 rent for the night and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her but the value quite an eye and thin being the use the had ere long the place of ieeing them net of together in high spirits 
they were gone 
the hoped w behnppy haweveroddl conltructedmch happineu might seem 
as for herself the was left with us may sensation of comfort 
i were perhaps ever likely to he hen 
she knew herself to be of the hot utility to the child 
and what wan it to her if frederick wentworth were only half a mile ii-um making himself ngmenble to other 
she would have liked to know how he felt an to a meeting 
perhaps indifferent 
if indifference could exist under inch cireumttancel 
he must be either indifferent or unwilling 
had he wished ever to see her again he need not have waited till thin time 
he would have done what she could not but believe that in hit place the should have done long ago when even had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting 
her brother and time came back delighted with my new acquaintance and their visit in general 
there had been music singing talking laughing ill that wan most agreeable 
charming manner in captain wentworth no uhyneu or reserve 
they ieemed all we know each other perfectly and he was coming the very next morning m shoot with charles 
he was in come persuasion 
15 to hreakl'an but not at the cottage though that had bunpmpoeedat lint 
better hehadbeen present come to the great home indeed and he ieemed afraid of being in my charles muagrove’l way on account of the child and therefore eornehow they hardly knew how it ended in charles being to meet him to breakfast at his father 
anne understood it 
he wished to avoid ieeing her 
he had inquired after her she found slightly as might suit a former alight uaintance seeming to acknowledge each a she had a knowledge actuated perhaps by the me view of securing introduction when they were to meet 
the morning hours of the cottage were always later than those of the other house end on the morrow the difference was no great that mary and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when charles came in to ray that they were just setting off that he was come for his dogs that his sister 
were following with ca n wentworth 
his rum meaning to visit mary an the child and captain wentworth proposing alloy to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient

she had already acknowledged it to herself and she could not think difenndy let him think of her ii he would

they were of sobering tendency

and other meetings 
a whether former feelings were to be renewed must he brought to the proof

and she was in the year nix 
a they happened before i went to tea in the year fix a occurred in the course of the first evening they spend together and though his niece did not far tear and though she had no means to oppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke anne felt the utter impo-ihility from her knowledge of being mind that he could be visited by remembrance any more than herself 
there man he the same immediate association of thought though the vicar 
ve far from conceiving it to he of equal pain 
hey had no conversation together no interest but what the common civility required 
once to much to each other i now nothing 
there bad been a time when of all the large party now filling the drawing-room at uppercrou they would have found it man difficult to cease to to one another 
with the exception perhaps of admiral and mr croft 
who seemed particularly attached and anne could allow no other exception even among e married by 
mum 
couple there could have been no two heart is open no truth is familiar no feelings no in unison no countenance

now they were an ltnngeu

there we a very general ignorance of all naval matter throughout the party 
and he wan very much questioned and lay by the two miamuagrovet who accrued ha to have anyone but for him an to the manner of living on board daily regulationl food houra c. 
and their surprise at his accounts at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which wan racticahle drew from him inme leannt ridicule w ich reminded anne of the early tray when the too had been ignorant and the too had been accused of opposing salmon to be living on board without anything to eat or any cook to diet 
it if there were or any servants to wait or any knives and for to me 
from thun listening end thinking the was round by i whisper of my mulgrove’t who overcome by fond regrets could not help laying

miss anne if it had ceased heaven to spare my poor son i dare ray he would have been just such another by thin time anne iupprened a smile and listened kindly while mr mangrove relieved her heart a little more 
and for a few minutes therefore could not keep page with the conversation of the others 
when she could let her attention sake in natural course again the found the miss muagroven just fetching the navy list their own navy list the first that had our been at uppercrou and sitting down together to pore over it with the professed view of finding out the ship which captain entworth had commanded

by rnsunsxou 
there was a momentary expression in ca n wentworth s face at this speech a certain case of his bright eye and curl of his handsome month which convinced anne that indeed of sharing in mrs musgmve's kind wishes as to her son he had probably been at some nltoget rid of him 
but it was tootransient an in urgency of self-amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself 
in mother moment he was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterward coming up to the sofa on which she and mrs mus ve were sitting 
took a place by the latter and enter into conversation with her in a low voice about her in doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace st there the kindest consideration for all that was real and unahourd in the parents feelings 
they were actually on the same sofa for mrs mangrove had most readily made room for him they were divided only by m rove 
it was no inrigniﬁcant barrier indeed 
my grave was of a comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment 
and while the agitations of anne’s slender form and pensive face may be considered as very completely screened captain wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat sighing over the destiny of a son whom alive nobody had cared for 
personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proponinnr 
a large bulky sure has as good a right to be in deep affliction as the most graceful net of limbs in the world 
but fair or not fair there are unbecoming connections which reason will patronage in vain 
which taste can not tolerate 
which ridicule will seize 
the admiral after taking two or three refreshing masonsron 
6 turnabout the room with his hand behind him being called to order by his wife now came up to captain wentwtmh 
and without any observation of what he might be interrupting thinking only of his own though began with 
if you had been a week later at lambton lent apring fredeﬁchyonwmddhavebeeoukedcogiveapulage to lady mary grieving and her daughter should i 
i am glad i wan not a week later then in the admiral abused him for his want of gallantry 
he defended himself though pleasing that he w d never willineg admit any lydia on board a tip of his excepting for a ball or a visit which a few hours might comprehend 
but if i know myself a said he a thin in from no want of gallantry toward them 
it is rather from feeling how impmeihle it is with all one effort and all one sacrifices to make the accommodations on board such an women ought to have 
there can he no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women to every perusal comfort so and thin in what i do 
i hate to hear of women on board for to lace them on board 
and no chip under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it this brought hie deter upon him 
a oh l frederick 
but i can not believe it of you 
— all idle reﬁnementl 
women may be as comfortable on board an in the best home in england 
i believe i have lived a much on board as most women and i know nothing superior to the accommodation of a manof-war 
i declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch ball with a kind how to anne 1 beyond what i always had in most of the chief 
l have lived in 
and they have been ever altogether a to summon 
nothing to the spare a her born 
a you were living with your hunlnm were the only women on board a but you yourself brought on harville her near her cousin and the three children round from portsmouth to plymouth 
where wan thie eurerﬁne extraordina none of gallantry of your then put a 1 ill urged in my frieudahip s in 
i would and any brother oﬂioer'c wife that could and i would bring anything of harville from the worlds end if he wanted it 
but do not imagine that i did not feel it an evil in itself au“pep€iid upon it they were all perfectly comfortable 
a i might not 
like them the better for at perhapo 
such a number of women in children have no right to be comfortable on board a my dear frederick you are talking quite idly 
pray what would become of our poor nailon’ wives who often want to be conveyed to one port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feeling 1 
a feeling 
you see did not prevent my taking an hydrv'ille and all her family to i‘llymouthl 1 but i hate to hear you talk in to like a one gentle 
man and an if women were all one ladiet innenrl of rational cmturee 
we none of in expect to be in tmooth water all our daye 
ah 
my dear aid the admiral 1 when he he 
got i wife he will sing a different tune 
when he ll married if we have the good luck to live to another war we shall ice him do as on and i and a great many others have done 
e shall have him very thankful to nobody that will bring him hit wife 
ay that we shall 1 now i have done a cried captain wentworth 
a when once married people begin to attack me with 
persuasion 
7 l soul you will think very differently when you are married a i can only say no i shall not 
a and then they again yes you will a and there in an end of it he got up and moved away 
what a great traveller you must have been many a mind my mangrove to my croft 
pretty well ma'am in the after year of my marriage 
though many women have done more 
i have closed the atlantic four time and have been once to the eat indies and back again and only once 
besides being in different place about home york and limbs and gibraltar 
but i never went beyond the strength and never veil in the west india 
we do not call bermuda or blame you know the went india mn mangrove had not a word to say in distant 
she could not accuse herself of having ever calledthem anything in the whole course of her life 
a and i do nature you ma'am a purse croft that nothing can exceed the accommodation of a man-of-war speak you know of the higher ram 
when come to a rights of course you are more conﬁn 
though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them 
and i can safely say that the part of my life he been spent on board a slap 
while we were together you know there was nothing to be feared 
thank god 
i have always been blessed with excellent health and no climate disagree with me 
a little disordered always the list twenty-four hours of going to tea but never knew what quickened was afterwards 
the only time that i ever really suffered in body or mind the only time that i ever fancied mytelf unwell or had any ideas of danger 
was the winter that i saved by myself at deal when the admiral captain raft then was in the north 12 rnsmsxox

lived in perpetual ﬁ-ightatthattimenndhnd all manner of innglnnry eornplainta from not knowing what to with myself or when i should hear from him next 
but a long us we could be together nothing ever ailed me end i never met 
with the intellect inconvenienee 
a ay to he one 
yes indeed oh i i am quite of your opinion on croft wan git mungmve'l hearty nnlwer 
there it nothing so bed at i question 
i am quite of your opinion 
i know what it in for mr mangrove always attended size and 1 am no glad when they ire over and he is safe back again the evening ended with dancing 
on in being propoeed anne offered her services ii veal 
and though herewwould iometimet all with tear 
up the not it the instrument the war extremely glad to be employed and desired nothing in return but to he unobserved 
t war a merry you stay and no one seemed in higher spirits that pain entworth 
she felt that a he had everything to elevate him which general attention and deference ind e all the mention of iii the young woman could or he mill hayterl the females of the family of caution already mentioned were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him 
and ii for henrietta and louisa they both named an entirely occupied by him that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could have made it incredible that t were not decided rivals 
if he were a little t by inch universal ouch eager admintion who could wonder 1 there were come of the thought which occupied anne while her longer were mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together equally without error and without con-cioulneu 
one the felt that he was looking at herself observing her altered imam perhaps pmunsrou 
48 trying to trace in them the mind of the face which had once charmed him 
and out she knew that he must have spoken of her 
she was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer 
but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced 
the answer was a oh no never 
she has quite given dancing 
she had rather play 
she is never tired 3 playing 
once too he woke to her 
she had left the instrument on the dancing being over and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the miss musgroves an idea of 
unintentionslly she returned to that part of the room 
he saw her and instantly rising said with studied politeness 
a i beg your pardon madam this is your seat 
a and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative he was not to induced to sit down again 
anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches 
his cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything 
cost 8 
captain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home to stay as in as he liked being as thoroughly the object of the admiral paternal kindness as of his wife 
he had intended on first arriving to proceed very soon into sh ire and visit the brother settled in that country 
but e attractions of uppercrou induced him to put this off 
there was so much of friendliness and of flattery and of everything must bewitching in his reception there 
the old were so hospitable the young so agreeable that he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take all the charms and perfection of edward's wife upon credit i little longer 
7 murmur 
itwnnoon a man with him almost 
day 
the muagmvel m hardly be more readyﬂtzryinvite than he to come particularly in the morning when he hadnocnrnpanionathnme 
farther admiral and mr croft were generally out of door 
wptherﬁnreruting thomas in their new theirgnaa made their and dawdling about in 3 way not endurable to a thing pom driving out in a i tell added to their enablinth g g go my hitherto there had been but one son of captain wentworth among the mangrove ad 
their dependencies 
it was unvarying warm admiration everywhere 
but thiindrnate footing war not more than enablilhed when a certain charlehayter returned among them to he a good deal disturbed by it and to think aptain wentworth very much in the way 
charles walter was the eldest of all the confined and i very amiable pleasing young man between whom and henrietta there had been a oonridemble appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworth introduction 
he war in order and having a curacy in the neighbourhood where reridence war not tired lived up his father home only two mile fwd-nub emu 
a short absence from home had left l'lll fair one guarded by his attention at thin critical road and when he came back he had the pain of doing very ill-bred manners and of ieeing captain wentworth 
my mangrove and on after were timers 
they had each had money but their marriage had made a mutual difference in their degree of consequence 
mr llnyter had come property of hit own but it wan inrigniﬁcnnt compared with mr mulgmve'e 
and while the summer were in the east clay of society in the misery the young hayterl would from their parents inhaler 
retired and unpolished way of living and their am defective education have been hardly in any claim punsuuron 
75 at all but for their connexion with up rcrou this eldest can of comic excepted who had c s to be a scholar and a gentleman and who won very superior in cultivation and manner to all the rent 
the two families had always been on excellent terme there being no pride on one tide and no envy on the other and only much a conncioumcel of superiority in the mist mangrove at made them pleased to improve their cause 
charles attendant to henrietta had been observed b her father and mother without any diea robution. 
twould not be a great match for her 
but henrietta liked him a 
and henrietta 5 
seem to like him 
henrietta fully thought no herself before captain wentworth tame 
but from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten 
which of the two sisters was preferred by captain wentworth wan as yet quite doubtful as far as anne’s observation reached 
henrietta was perhaps the prettiest louisa had the higher lpll'ltl 
and the knew not new whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him 
mr and mrs mangrove either from seeing little or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughter and of all the young men who came near them seemed to leave everything to take its chance 
there was not the smallest up assurance of solicitude or remarks about them in the maiden-house 
but it was different at the cottage the lungs couple there were more disposed to calculate an wonder 
and captain wentworth had not been above four or have times in the mind mutgrovea’ company and charles walter had but just ren passed when anne had to listen to the opinion of her brother and sister an to 1055 waft the one liked but 
charles gave it for louisa mary for henrietta but quite agreeing that to have him marry either would be extremely delightful 
76 persuasion 
charles 
had never seen i pleaunter nun in his life 
and from what he had once heard captain wentworth hinuelfuy war very cure that he had not made lead than twenty thousand pounds by the war 
here war a fortune at once besides which there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war 
and he was rare captain wentworth war a likely a man to dinner herself at any officer in the navy 
oh 
it would i upirnl match for either of hit time 
upon my word it would replied mary 
a dear me 
if he ihould else to any very great honour if he ihould ever he made i baronetl lady wentworth a round 
very well 
that would be a noble thing 
indeed for henrietta 
she would take place of me then and henrietta would not dislike that 
sir frederick and lady wentworth 
it would be but a new creation however and i never think much of your new creations.” it united mary bent to think henrietta the one preferred on the very account of charles walter whoee retenuiom she wished to see put an end to 
she looked down very decidedly upon the hunters and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed 
very sad for herself and her children 
you know a raised the 1 i can not think him at all a t match for henrietta 
and considering the alliance which the murgrover have made the bar no right to throw herself away 
i do not think any young woman ha 
a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family and be giving had connections to those who have not been used to them 
and my who in charles hnyter 
nothing but a country curate 
a most improper match for miss mangrove of uppercrou 
her husband however would not agree with her rmussrou 
77 here 
for besides having a regard for his cousin charles walter was an eldest son and he saw things as an eldest son himself 
now you are talking nonsense mary 1 was therefore his answer 
a it would not be a pen match for henrietta but charles has a very fair chance through the auspices of getting something from the bishop in the course of a year or two 
and you will please to remember that he is the eldest son 
whenever my uncle dies he steps into very pretty property 
the estate at winter is not less than two hundred and fifty acres besides e farm near union which is some of the best land in the country 
i grant you that an of them but charles would be a very shocking match or henrietta and indeed it could not be 
he is the only one that could be possible 
but he is a very good-natured good sort of a fellow 
and whenever inthrop comes into his hands he will make a different sort of lace of it and live in s vc different sort of way 
an with that property he will 
never be a contemptibk man 
good freehold property 
no 
no 
henrietta might do worse than many charles walter 
and if she has him and louisa can get captain wentworth i shall be very well satisﬁed.” 1 charles may say what he pleases cried mary to anne as soon as he was out of the room 
but it would be shockiu so have henrietta marry charles sister i ve be thing for her and still worse for m g and the more it is very much to he wished that captain wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head and i have very little doubt that he has 
she took hardly any notice of charles walter yesterday 
i wish you had been there to see her behaviour 
and as to captain wentworth s liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsense to say so 
for he certainly him like henrietta a great deal the best 
but charles is so positive 
48 pnnsussmn 
i wish you had been with us yesterday for then you might have decided between us 
and am sure you would have thought as i did unless you had been determined to give it against me 
a dinner at mr mus rove’s had been the occasion when all these things should d have been seen by anne 
but she had staid at home under the mixed plea of a headache of her own and some return of indisposition in little charles 
she had thought only of avoiding captain wentworth 
but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening 
as to captain wentworth’s views she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endanger the happiness of either sister or impeaching his own honour than that he should prefer henrietta to louisa or louisa to henrietta 
either of them would in all probability make him an affectionate humoured wife 
with regard to charles walter she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman and a heart to |pgilrathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned 
but enrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings the alteration could not be understood too soon 
charles walter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousins behaviour 
she had too old i regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings distinguish every past hope and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from uppercrou but there was such a change as became very alarming when such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause 
he had been ailment only two sundays and when they parted hid left her interested even to the height of his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy and obtaining runsussron 
45 that of uppercmss instead 
it had then seemed the object nearest her hurt that dr shirley the rector who for more than for years had been zealoiuly discharging all the duties of his office but was now growing too infirm for many of them should be quite xed an engaging a curate 
should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford and should give charles walter the promise of it 
the advantage of his having to come only to uppercrou instead of going six miles another war 
of his having in every cost a better curacy 
of his belonging to their dear shirley 
and of dear good dr shirley s being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue had been a great deal even to louisa but had been almost everything to henrietta 
when he came back all the zeal of the business was gone louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had held with dr shirl she was at the window looking out for ca tam wentworth 
and even henrietta had at best on x a divided attention to give and seemed to have forgotten all the former don t and solicitude of the association 
well i am very glad indeed 
but i always thought you would have it 
i always thought you sure 
it did not appear to me that 
in short you know dr shirley mu 
have a curate and you had secured his promise 
ii he coming louisa 
a one morning very soon after the dinner at the musgroves at which anne had not been present captain wentworth walked into the drawing-room it the cottage where were only herself and the little invalid charles who was lydia on the sofa 
the surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliot deprived his manners of their usual composure he started and could only say a i thought the 8th masuasron 
miss grove had been here mrs mangrove told me i should and them here before he walked to the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behave 
they are upstairs with my sister they will be down in a few moments i dare say a had been anne’s reply in all the confusion that was natural 
and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him she would have been out of the room the next moment and released captain wentworth as well as herself 
he continued at the window 
and after calmly and politely saying a i hope the little boy is better 1 was silent 
she was obliged to kneel down by the sofa and remain then to satisfy her patient 
and thus they contained a few minutes when to her very great satisfaction she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule 
she hoped on turning her head to see the master of the house 
but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy 
charles walter probably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain lventworth than captain wentworth had been by the sight of anne 
she only attempted to say how do you do 
will not you sit down 
the others will be here presently 
captain wentworth however came from his window apparently not ill-disposed for conversation 
but charles walter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table and taking up the newspaper 
and captain wentworth returned to his window 
another minute brought another addiu'on 
the younger boy a remarkable stout forward child of two years old having got the door opened for him by some one without made his determined appearance among pluuuron’ 
8 them 
and went night to the case to see what wan going on and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away 
there being nothing to be eat he could only have some play 
and his aunt would not let him seize hiiick brother he began to fasten himself upon her an the knelt in such a way that busy as the win about charles the could not shake him oil she spoke to him ordered stream and inspired in vain 
once she did contrive to 12th him away but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly 
walter 1 laid the 1 get down this moment 
you are extremely troublelome 
i am very angry with on 
or x a walter 1 cried charlenyter 1 why do you not do a on are bid 
do not you huryournunt l k 
me to me walter 
come to consign eden 
but not a hit did walter itir 
in another moment however she found herself in the state of being released from him 
name one was taking him from her 
though he had bent down her head to much that his little uurdy hand were softened from around her neck and he was resolutely borne away before she knew that captain weston had done it 
her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly ipeechleu 
she could not even thank him 
she could only hung over little charles with most dilordered feelings 
his kindness in stepping forward to her relief the manner the silence in which it had passed the little particular of the circumstance with the conviction noon forced on her by the noise he was itudioualy making widi the child that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks and rather sought to satisfy that her conversation wan the last of his wants produced such a 82 prisuasioh 
condition of varying but agitation at the could not recover from till by the entrance of mary and the mind mangrove to truth over her little patient to their cares and give the room 
she could not my 
it might have been an opportunity of watching the love and jealousies of the fair 
they were now altogether 
but the could any for none of it 
it was evident that clmrlct haytcr was not well inclined towardl captain “'cntworth 
she had a strong imi period of his having laid in a vast tone of voice after captain wentworth interference 1 you ought to have minded nu walter 
i told you not to tune us in 5 
and could comprehend his n-gretu'ng that pass 
in wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself 
but neither charles haytel’t feelings nor mybody’l feelings could interest her till she had a little better arranged her own 
she wan ashamed of self quite ashamed of being to servant to overcome by such a trifle 
but to it war and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her 
chutn5. ther opportunities of making her observation could not fail to occur 
anne had noon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion though too wine to acknowledge at much at home 
where the knew it would have wliuﬁcd neithzrhmband nor wife 
for while the confidence louisa to be rather the favourite he could not but think ml far at the might llll’l‘ to judge from memory and experience that captain wentworth was not in love with either 
they were more in love with him 
yet there it war not love 
it won a little fever pnsmtsrorv 
8 of admiration 
but it might probably must end in love with some 
charles walter seemed aware of being delighted and yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them 
anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about and of pointing out some of the evila they were expoaing tlienuclm to 
she did not 
attribute guile to any 
it war the highest satisfaction to her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning 
there was no true he no pitiful triumph in bits 
manner 
he had put by never heard and never thought of any claim of charles walter 
he only wrong in a thing the exertions for accepting must be the word of two young women at once 
after a short struggle however charles walter seemed to quit the old 
three day had passed without his coming once to uppercrou 
a most decided change 
he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner 
and having been found on the occasion by mr mangrove with some large book 
before him mr and mr mangrove were sure all could not be right and talked with grave faces of his studying himself to death 
it war mary’a ho and belief that he had received a positive minarﬁorn henrietta and her husband lived under the constant attendance of ieeing him to-morrow 
anne could only feel that charles huger wu wise 
he morning about this time charles move and captain wentworth being gone s-ahooting together at the sister 
in the cottage were sitting quietly at work they were visited at the window by the sisters from the 
martina-house 
it wan a very line november day and the mill muagrovel came through the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to say that they were going by persuasion 
to take i long walk and therefore concluded mary could not like to go with them 
and when mary immediately lined with some jealouty at not being supposed no g walker 1 oh yes 
i should like to join you very much i am very fond of a long walk 
a anne felt 
persuaded by the look of the two girls that it was precisely what they did not wish and admired again the son of necessity which the family habit served to produce of everything being to be communicated and everything being to be done together however undesigned and inconvenient 
she tried to dissuade mary from going but in vain 
and that being the case thought it beat to accept the mind muegrovel much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise a she might be useful in turning back with her ill and lessening the interference in any plan of their own 
a i can not imagine why they should suppose i ihould not like a long walk said mary an she went up in 
a everybody in any supposing that i am not a good walker 
and yet they would not have been pleased if we had refused to join them 
when people come in this manner on purpose to ask us how can one my no 2 
just at they were letting off the gentlemen returned 
they had taken out a young dog which had post their sport and sent them back early 
their time and strength and irish were therefore exactly ready for thin walk no they entered into it with pleasure 
could anne have foreseen web a junction the would have amid at home 
but from name feelings of interest and curiosity he fancied now that it war too late to retract and the whole six not forward together in the direction chosen b the miss mulgl'ovel who evidently considered the way it an under their guidance 
anne’s object was not to be in the way of an body 
and where the narrow path across the old made many nnsmtsxon 
85 rations necessary to with her brother and 3 
her plruu'ry in dimk must arise from the exercise and the day from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the town leaves and withered hedges and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extent of autumn that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness that season which has drawn from every poet worthy of being read some attempt at description or some lines of feeling 
she occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations 
but it was not possible that when within reach of captain wentworth s conversation with either of the miss musgmves she should not try to hear it 
yet she caught little very remarkable 
t was mr live y chat such as any young persons on an intimate footing might fall into 
e was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta 
louisa certainly at more forward for his notice than her sister 
this stinction appeared to increase and there was one speech of louisas which struck her 
after one of the man praises of the day which were continually bursting forth captain wentworth added 
what glorious weather for the admiral and my sisters they meant to take i long drive this morning 
perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills 
they talked of coming into this side of the country 
wonder whereabouts they will set today 
oh it does happen very often i assure you 
but my sister makes nothing of it 
she would as love be tossed out it not ah 
you make the most of it i know cried louisa 
but il'it were really so i should do just the same in her place 
if i loved a man an she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever separate us and i would rather be returned by him than driven safely by anybody else 
he szsuasrorr 
it wan porter with enthul'aem 
a had you i 
cried he catching the lame tone 
i honour you 
a and there wan silence between them for a little while 
anne could not immediately fall into a question again 
the sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by unless some tender regret fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year with declining happy news and the images of youth and hope and ring all gone together 
blunted her memory 
she to herself to nay ll they struck by order into another this a ii not thin one of the way i to winthrop 
a gift nobody heard or at least nobody answered her 
winthrop however or it 
environs 
jane young men are sometimes to be met with struggling about near home 
wan their deetination 
and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large cnclorurel where the laugh at work and the fresh made ipath spoke the farmer counteract the sweets of politics dependence and meaning to have spring again they gained the summit of the most considerable hill which parted uppercrou and with and noon commanded a full view of the latter at the not of the hill on the other side 
winthrop without beauty and without dignity wastretched before them an indifferent house standing low and beamed in by the baron and building of a forward 
yes mary exclaimed 1 13ch me 
here in winter 
i declare i had no idea 
well now i think we had better turn back 
i am excessively tired 
henrietta conscious and ashamed and ieeing no cousin charles walking along any the or leaning against any gate war ready to do an new wished 
but no l a d charles mangrove and no no i a cried louisa more eagerly and taking her lines aide mum 
to be arguing the matter warmly 
reasus’sron 
87 charles in the meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt now that he was so near 
and very evidently though more fearfully t rug to induce his wife to go too 
but this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength 
and when he recommended the advantage cheating herself a quarter of an hour at winter as she felt so tired he resolutely answered a oh no indeed 
walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good 
and in short her look and manner declared that go she would not 
after a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations it was settled between charles and his two sisters that he and henrietta should run down for a few minutes to see their aunt and cousins while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill 
louisa seemed the principal stranger of the plan 
and as she went a pink way with them down the hill still talking to henrietta mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her and saying to captain wentworth 
a it is very unpleasant having such connexions but i assure you i have never been in the house above twice in my life 
she received no other answer than an artificial assenting smile followed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which anne perfectly knew the meaning of 
the brow of the hill where the remained was a cheerful t louisa returned 
an mary mending a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a smile was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her 
but when louisa drew cupmin wentworth away to try for a pleasing of nuts in an adjoining hedgerow and the were gone by degrees quite out of right and sound perry was happy no longer she quarrelled with 88 rusmsxou 
her own tea was sure louiehad got a much better somewhere and nothing could prevent her from going to look for at better also 
she turned through the name to but could not see them 
anne found a nice out it her on a dry runny bank under the hedgerow in which the had no doubt of their skill being in time or other 
mary at down for a moment but it would not do 
the wan lure louisa had found a better teat nowhere else and the would go on till she overtook her 
anne really tired herlelf wan glad to sit down 
and she ve noon heard captain wentworth and louisa in the b ge-row behind her an if making their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down the centre 
they were speaking no they drew near 
i louion’t voice wan the list dittinguithed 
she opened to be in the middle of some eager tpeech 
what anne ﬁnt heard was 
and to i made her go 
i could not bear that the ihould be far htened from the visit by such nonsense 
what 
would f be turned back from doing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right by the air and interference of such i person or of any person i my my 
no i have no idea of being i can persuade 
when i have made up my mind i have made it 
and henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hero to call at winthrop to-day 
and yet the was ll near giving it up out of nomenuical com laimncel 1 1 she would have turned back then but or you 2 1 1 she would indeed 
i am almost ashamed to say in 
a happy for her to have such a mind at yourself at hands after the hints you give just now which lid but 
concern my own observation the last rim 1 won in company with him i need not affect to have no comprehension of what it going on 
i see that more than i msussron 
5 mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question 
and woe besides him and her too when it comes to things of consequence when they are placed in circumuaocesrequiring fortitude and strength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this 
your sister is an amiable creature 
but your is the character of decision and archness i see 
if you value her conduct or happiness confused as much of your own spirit into her as a can 
but this no doubt you have been always doing 
it is the worst evil of too yielding and decisive a character that no influence over it can be depended on 
you are never sure of a good impression being durable 
everybody may say it 
let those who would be happy be warm 
here is a not a said he catching one down from an upper brought to exemplif s beautiful glossy out which blessed with origin strength outlived all the storms of autumn 
not picture not a weak spot anywhere 
this but he continued with pl fully so enmity a while so many of its brethren have far less and been trodden under foot is still in possession of all the harp iness that a gaze but can be supposed capable of hen returning to his former earnest tone 
a my first wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be warm 
if louisa mangrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life she will cherish all her resent powers of mind 
e had done and was unanswered 
it would have surprised anne if louisa could have readily answered such i speech words of such interest spoken with such serious warmth 
she could imagine what louisa was feeling 
for herself she feared to move lest she should be seen 
while she remained a hush of low marbling holly protected her and the were moving on 
before they were 
beyond her hearing however louisa spoke again 
5 reasussrou 
mary is good-natured enough in many respects said she 
a but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense and pride 
the elliot pride 
she has a great deal too much of the elliot pride 
we do so wish that charles had married anne instead 
i you know he wanted to marry anne e 1 after a moment s pause captain wentworth said 
a do you mean that she refused him 
a mob 
yes 
certainly 
when did that happen p 
i do not exactly know for henrietta and i were at school at the time 
but i believe about a year before he married ma 
i wish she had accepted him 
we should all have liked her a great deal better 
and papa and means always think it 
was her great friend lady russell’s doing that she did not 
they think charles might not be learned and foolish enough toplcasc lady russell and that therefore she persuaded anne to refuse him the sounds were retreating and anne distinguished no more 
her own emotions still kept her ﬁxed 
she had much to recover from before she could move 
the listeners proverbial fate was not absolutely hers she had heard no evil of herself but she had heard a great deal of very painful import 
she saw how her own character was considered by captain wentworth and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation 
as soon as she could she went after mary and have 
in found and walked back with her to their former station by the still felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected and once more in motion together 
her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give 
charles and henrietta returned bringing as may be 
humph 
a 9 i conjectured charles walter with them 
the minutiae of the main anne could not attempt to understand 
even captain wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here 
but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman's tide and a relenting on the lady s and that they were now very glad to be together again did not admit a doubt 
henrietta looked a little ashamed but very well pleased 
— charles walter exceedingly happy end they were devoted to each other nlmoet m the list instant of their all netting forward for uppercrou 
everything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth nothing could be plniner 
and where many divisiom were necessary 
or even where they were not they walked idea by side nearly an much as the other two 
in a long of fellow land where there was ample brace for l d3 were thindivided forming three distinct parties 
a to that party of the three which bounded lent animation and lean complainance anne neceuarily belonged 
she charles and mary and was tired enough to be very glad of charles other arm 
but charles though in very good humour with her wan out of temper with his wife 
mary had shewn herself obliging to him and was now to reap the con uncle which consequence we hit drown her inn moot every moment to cut soil the hen i of income settle in the hedge with his witch 
and when mary began to complain of it and lament her being ill-uned according to come in being on the hedge side while anne was never inoomrnoded on the other he the am of both to hunt after a vessel which he had a momentary glance of and they could hardly get him along it all 
this long meadow bar end a lane which their forth at the end nfit wan to crown and when the party at all reached the gate of exit 
the carriage advancing 6 9 rensussron 
in the same direction which had been some time heard was just coming up and proved in be admiral croft’s gig 
he and his wife had taken their intended drive and were returning home 
upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired 
it would have her full a mile and they were going through uppercrou 
the invitation was general and generally declined 
the miss muagmves were not at all tired and mary was either offended by not being asked before any of the others or what louisa called the elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one-horse chaise 
the walking party had crossed the lane and were surmounting an opposite stiles and the admiral was putting his horse into motion again when captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to any something to his sister 
the something might be guessed by its effects 
v amiss elliot i am sure you are tired cried mr croft 
a do let us have the pleasure of taking you home 
here is excellent room for three i assure you 
if we were all like you i believe we might sit our 
you must indeed you must 
anne was still in the lane and though instinctively beginning to decline the was not allowed to proceed 
the admiral s kind urgency came in support of his wife s the would not be refused they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner and captain wentworth without saying a word turned to her and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage 
yes 
he had done it 
she was in the carriage and felt that he had placed her there that his will and his hands had done it that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue made his resolution to give her rest 
she msuasrou 
48 wan very much affected ivory the view of his disposition towards her which all these thing made apparent 
thin little circmmtanoe ieemed the completion of all that had gone before 
she understood him 
he could not forgive her but he could not be unl'eeling 
though condemning her for the past 
and considering it with high and unjust reoenonent though perfectly careless of her and though becoming attached to another still he could not see her elder without the desire of giving her relief 
it wan a remainder of former aentiment 
it was an impulse of me though unacknowledged friendship 
it was a poor his own warm and amiable heart which she could not céhtemplate without emotions ao compounded of pleasure and pain that the knew not which prevailed 
her answer to the kindness and the remarks of her companion were at lint unconscioualy given 
they had travelled half their way along the rough lane before the was quite awake to what they paid 
she then found them talking of a frederick 1 he certainly mean to have one or other of than two girls copy a raised the admiral 
a but there in no laying which 
he ha been running after them too long enough one would think to make up his mind 
ay this come 
of the peace 
if it were war now he would have settled it long ago 
we uilora miu elliot can not afford to make long courtahipa in time of war 
how many days was it my dear between the first time of my lacing you and our sitting down together in our lodging at north yarrnouth l i we had better not talk about it in dear replied mr croft pleasantly 
a for if miss e liot were to hear how noon we came to an understanding 
the would never be persuaded that we could be ha py together

and anne being engaged to join her noon at the was folded wan looking forward to arm early removal to tell such and beginning to think how her own comfort wan likely to be affected by it 
it would place her in the same village with captain wentworth within half a mile of him 
they would have to frequent the nine church and there must be intercourse between the two families 
this was against her 
bates the other hand he spent so much of hipersuasion 
45 time at uppercrou that in removing thence the might be considered rather an leaving him behind than a going towards him 
and upon the whole she believed the most on thin intereeting quenion be the gainer almost an certainly a in her change of domestic society in leaving r mary for lady russell 
she wit it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing captain wentworth at the hall those room had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her 
but she wan yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and ca tain wentworth never meeting anywhere 
they not like each other and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good and were lady russell to see them together she might think that he had too much delaford and she too little 
these points formed her chicfwlicitude in anticipating her removal from upperch where she felt she had been mtioned quite long enough 
her usefulness to little charles would always give some awectneulto the i memory of her two months visit there but he was gaining strength pace and the had nothing else to my or 
the conclusion of her visit however was diversion in a way which she had not at all imagined 
captain gentworthkaﬂer being seen and unheard of at p rcmu or two whole days appeared a sin among their e to fortify herself by a relation of what had kept him away 
a letter from his friend captain harville having found him out it in

of their being therefore 
quite unknown within twenty miles of each other 
captain harville had never been in good health iince a chest wound which he received two year before and captain weigh nosunsrou

hit acquittal wan complete his friendship warmly injured a lively interest excited for his friend and his description of the line country about some is feelingly attended to b the party that iii must desire to see laying themselves and a project for going thither will the consequence 
the young people were all wild to lee lyme 
captain entworth talked of going there again himself it war only aeventeen miles from uppercrou 
though november the weather war by no man had 
and in short louisa who war the most eager of the eager having formed the resolution to go and beside the pleasure of doing as she liked being new arms with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till tummcr 
nod to some they were to go 
charles mary anne henrietta lenin and captain wentworth 
the first hecdleu scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night 
but to this mr mangrove for the take of his home would not content 
and when it came to be rational considered a day in the middle of november would not leave much time for lacing a new place nfter deducting seven hours as the nature of the country required for going and jumping 
they were consequently to my the night there and not to be expected ck till the next day dinner 
this war felt to be a considerable amendment 
and though they all met at the great home at rather an early breakfast hour and net off very punctually it was so much part noon before the two carriages mr mutgrove‘a coach containing the four ladies and charles curricle in which he drove captain wentworth were descending the long hill into some and entering upon persuasion 
14 the still deeper street of the town itself that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them before the light and warmth of the day were gone 
v after assuring accommodations and offering a dinner at one of the inns the next thing to he done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the least

captain wentworth v turned in to call on his friend 
the others walked on and he was to join them on the lobby 
they were by no means tired of wondering and admiring 
and not even louisa leaned to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long when saw him coming after them with three companions l well known already by description m be captain and mr harville and a captain nwick who was laying with them 
captain benwick had some time ago been lint lieutenant of the acacia 
and the account which cg tnin wentworth had given of him on his return from some before his warm price of him an an excellent young man and an officer 
whom he had always valued highly which must have mm him well in the esteem of every linener had been for owed by a little history of being private life which rendered him perfectly interesting in e eyes of all the ladies 
he had been engaged to captain harville’a winter and we now mourning her longer 
they had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion 
fortune came he prize 
made an lieutenant being great 
promotion too came at no but fanny harville did not live to know it 
she had died the preceding eummer while he wan at least 
captain wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more nusuasron 
45 attached to women than poor benwick had been to fanny harville or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change 
he confirmed his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily uniting very strong feelings with quiet serious and retiring manners and a decided taste for reading and sedentary reuiu 
to banish the interest of the story the fricnd’e‘hip between him and the harville seemed if possible augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance and captain benwick was now living with them entirely 
captain harville had taken his present house for half a year 
his taste and his health and his fortune all directing him to a residence extensive and by the sea 
and the grandeur of the country and the retirement of some in the winter appeared exact adapted to captain benwiclt’u ray of mind 
she sympathy and good-will excited towards captain benwick was very l 1 and yet a rapid anne to herself as they now moved forward to meet the party he has not perhaps more sormwing heart than i have 
i can not believe his prospects i slighted for ever 
he is younger than i am 
younger in feeling if not in fact 
younger as i man 
he will rally again and be happy with another they all met and were introduced 
captain harville wan a all dark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lame 
and from strong features and want of health looking much older than captain wentworth 
captain benwick looked and war the youngest of the three and compared with either of them a little man 
he had a leaning face and a melancholy air just at he ought to have and drew back from conversation 
captain harville though not equally captain wentworth in manners was a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging 
mrharville i degree roo persuasion 
la polite than her husband neerned however to have the lame good feelings and nothing could he more please than their desire of considering the whole party no friend 
of their own became the friend of captain wentworth or more kindly hoepitablc than their cntmtiee for their all promising to dine with them 
the dinner already ordered at the inn wan at last though unwillingly accepted an an excuse 
but they ieemed almost hurt that captain wentworth should have brought any such party to some without considering it at a thing of course that they should dine with them 
there was to much attachment to captain wentworth in all this and such a hesitating charm in a degree of hospitality to uncommon is unlike the usual style of givevand-take invitations and dinner of formality and i lay that anne felt her spirits not likely to he bennet by an increasing acquaintance among hu hrother-oiﬁeert 
there would have been all my friends wan her thought 
and the had to struggle against great tendency to iowneu 
on quitting the lobby they all went in-doorl with their new friends and found wants as usually are none but than who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating in many 
anne had a moment astonishment on the subject herself 
but it was noon lost in the ple‘mnter feelings which sprung from the night of all the in serious connivance and nice arrangement of captain caviller to turn the actual space to the but purple account to supply the deficiencies of lodging-home furniture and defend the windows and door against the winter stone to he expected 
the variety in the ﬁtting-up of the more where the common necessaries revived by the owner in the common indifferent pay might 
were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood excellently persuasion 
i or i worked up and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries captain harville had visited were more than amusing to anne connected as it all was with his profession the fruit of its labours the effect of its influence on his habits the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented made it to her a something more or less than gratiﬁcation 
captain harville was no reader 
but he had contrived excellent accommodations and fashioned very pretty shelves for a tolerable collection of well-hound volumes the property of attain benwick 
his tameness prevented him rorn ng much exercise 
but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within 
he drew he furnished he carpentered he eluded 
he made toys for the children 
he fashioned new netting-needles and pains with improvements and if everything else was done sat down to his large ﬁshing-net at one comer of the room 
anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house 
and use by whom she found herself walking burst forth into raptures admiration and delight on the character of the navy 
their friendliness their brotherliness their openness their uprightness 
protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in england 
that they only knew how to live and they only deserved to be respected and loved 
they went back to dress and dine 
and so well had the scheme answered already that nothing was found amiss 
though its being a so entirely out of the season and the 5 no thoroughfure of hymen and the 5 no expectation of corn nay had brought many apologies from the heads of inn 
anne found herself by this time owing so much more hardened to being in captain \gentworth’s coming on persuasion 
pony than the had at lint imagined could ever be that the sitting down to the tame table with him now and the interchange of the common civility attending on it they never got beyond what become a mere nothing 
he night were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow but captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening 
and he came burying his friend arts which was more than had been expected it having been agreed that captain benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the pretence of to many strangers 
he ventured among them again however though hit tpiritt certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the part in general 
while captain north and harville led the talk on one ride of the room and by recurring to former days supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy ay and entertain the others it fell to anne’s lot to placed rather apart with captain llcnwick 
and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him 
he was thy and disposed to attention 
but the songs ng mildness of her countenance and gentleness of her manner too had their effect 
and anne was well repaid the rest trouble of exertion 
he was evidently a young man of considerable tune in reading though principally in poetry 
and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening indulgence in the discussion of subjects which his usual companion had probably no concern in the had the hope of being of real use to him in some tug getting at to the duty and benefit of struggling against affection which had naturally grown out of their conversation 
for though shy he did not seem deserved it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual rettraintt 
and having talked of poetry the richest of the present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the ﬁrttrrate poem trying “humor 
103 toascertain whether mutational tbeladyqflbelah were to be preferred and how ranked the gay and the bride of 15110 and moreover how the gl'aaur was to be pronounced he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other 
he repeated with such trcmulous fearing the various lines which imagined a broken heart or a a mind destroyed by wretchedness and looked so securely as if he meant to he understood that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry and to say that the thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely 
and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it tnrly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly 
his looks showing him not pained hut leaped with this allusion to his situation she was embol end to go on 
and feeling in herself the right 
of seniority of mind she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study 
and on being requested to pnmculatizc mentioned such works of our best morality such collections of the rest letters ruch memoirs of cloisters of worth and suffering as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest presents and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances 
captain bcnwiclr listened attentively and seemed grate us for the interest implied 
and thou he with a shake of the head and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his noted down the names of those she recommended and promised to procure and read them 
when the evening was over anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to some to press patience and resignation to a young man whom she had my nuumox 
nevereeen before 
mromlddtehelpfaﬁnbonmore serious reflection that like man other great morals and reached the had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill hear examination 
than 18 
none and henrietta ending themselves the earliest of the party the next morning agreed to mull down to the tea before breakfast 
they went to the hands to watch the knowing of the tide which i line south-catterly breeze wan bringing in with all the grandeur which is at a horse admitted 
they pulled the morning 
lord in the tea 
sympathise in the delay host of the fresh-feeling breeze 
and were silent 
till enrietta ruddenly began again with 
oh yes i am quite convinced that with very few exceptions the lea-air alwayt duel good 
there can be no doubt of in having been of the greatest service to dr shirl ifter l’lll illnele last spring twelvemonth 
he dcc am himself that coming to same for a month did him more good than all the medicine he took 
and that being by the least always make him feel young again 
now i can not help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the tea 
i do think he had better leave uppercrou entirely and sex at some 
do not you anne 
do not you agree with me that it in the hen thing he could do both for himself and mr shirley 
she has cousin here you know and many acquaintance which would make it cheerful or her and i am sure the would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand in case of his having another teizuret indeed i think it quite melancholy to have much excellent a 
a al.1414915 mum 
mtnsussron 
105 people as dr and mrs shirley who have been doing good all their lives wearing out their last days in a place like uppercrou where excepting our family they seem shut out from all the world 
i wish his friends would propose it to him 
i really think they ought 
and as to procuring a disposition there could be no difficulty at his time of life and with his character 
my only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish 
he is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions 
over-scrupulous must say 
do not you think anne it is being overscrupulous 
do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience when a clergyman sacriﬁces his health for the sake of duties which may be as well performed by another mean 
and at some too only seventeen miles or he would be near enough to hear if people thought there was anything to complain of anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech and entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man though here it was good of a lower standard for what could be altered but general acquiescence 
she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business 
felt the claims of dr shortly to repose as she ought 
saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man as a resident curate and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate’s being married 
i wish said henrietta very well pleased with her companion 1 i wish lady russell lived at 
uppercross and were intimate with dr shirley 
i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody i always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything 
i am afraid of her as i told you before quite afraid of 105 pwasion 
lumber-jule the ii an veryclever 
but i respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbour at a reproof 
no war amused by henrietta’t manner of being grateful and amused alas that the course of events and the new interests of henrietta’a view would have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the muegmve fund 
3 the had only time however for a general answers an a wish that each another woman were at uppercrou before all subjects suddenly ceased on seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming toward them 
they came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready 
but louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that the had something to procure at a shop invited them all to go hack with her into the town 
the were all at her hen they name to the steps leading spared from the back a gentleman at the more moment preparing to come down politely drew hack and hoped to give them way 
they amended and pained him 
and no they parted anne’s face caught his eye and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration which the could not be insensible of 
she war looking remarkably well 
her very regular ve rett featurel having the bloom and fro-linear of yoiiytlrp restored by the line wind which had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of eye which it had also produced 
it was evident that the gentleman corn letter a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly 
pain wentworth loo round at her intently in a way which shewed his noticing of it 
he gave her a moment glance a glance of heightened which seemed to ray a hat man in much with you and even i at thin moment see something like anne elliot again after attending louisa through her guineas and loitering about a little longer they returned to the inn 
persuasion 
i 07 end anne in paling afterward quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room had nearly run against the very name gentleman s he came out of dining upurtvnent 
she had before conjectured him to be a manager like themselves and determined that a well-looking groom who was struggling about near the two in a they came back ihould be his servant 
both mother and man being in mourning tiled the idea 
it was now proved that he belonged to the same inn themielvei 
and thin second meeting about it wan who proved against by the gendelnan'e local that he thought her very lovely and by the readiness and propriety of his apology that he wan u m of exceedingly good manners 
he ieemed about thirty and though not lmndnomc had an agreeable potion 
anne felt that the ihould like to know who he was 
they had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage almost the lists they had heard lince entering lyme drew half the party to the window 
it we 
a gendcman’l carriage i cun'icle 
but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door 
somebody must be in away 
it wan driven by a servant in morning 
he word cun’icle made charles mangrove jump up that he might compare it with his own 
the tenant in mourning roused anne’s curiosity and the whole six were collected to look by the time the owner of the curricle was to he seen issuing from the door under the bow and civility of the household and taking his seat to drive of

if the servant had not been in morning one should have known him by the livery 
a putting all these ve extraordinary circumstances together a said captain “yentworth 
we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin 
when she could command ma s attention anne quiedy tried to convince her that s father and mr elliot had not for man years been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable 
at the same time however it was a secret gratiﬁcation to herself to have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good sense 
she would not upon any account mention her having met with him the second time 
luckily mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their early walk but she would have felt quite ill-used by anne 3 having actually ran against him in the passage and received his very polite excuses while she had never been near him at all 
no that county littje interview must remain a perfect secret 
of course said ma 1 you will mention our seeing mr elliot the next time you write to bath 
i think my father certainly ought to hear of it 
do mention all about him 
anne avoided a direct reply but it was just the circumstance which she considered at not merely unnecessary to be communicated but as what ought to be suppreucd 
the offence which had been given her father many years back she knew 
eliubeth’s rticular share in it she suspected 
and that mr elliot’s idea always produced irritation in both wan beyond a doubt 
mary never wrote to bath herself

breakfast had not been long over what they were joined by captain and mr harville and captain benwick 
with whom they had appointed to take their six walk about some 
they ought to be netting at 
for uppercroubyone and in the mean whilewere to be all together and out of door 
an long at they could 
anne found captain benwick getting near her at noon at they were all fairly in the meet 
their conversation the preceding evening did not incline him to seek her again 
and the walked together some time talking at before of mr it and lord baron and mill at unable at before and a unable as any other two readier to think exactly alike of the merit of either till tomething occasioned an almost general change amongst their pity and instead of captain benwick she had crgmin arville by her ride

no danger of her being lent to lea-again 
he took his chance for the rest 
wrote up for love of absence but without waiting the return travelled night and day till he got to portsmouth rowed of to the power that instant and never left the poor fellow for a week 
that is what he did and nobody else could have saved poor james 
you may think miss elliot whether he in dear to us i a anne did think on the question with perfect decision and laid as much in reply as her own feelings could accomplish or in his ieemed able to bear for he was too much affected to renew the subject and when he 1 gate again it way of something totally different 
no harville s giving it at her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home determined the direction of all the party in what vain to be their last walk 
they would account by them to their door and then am and set a them-elven 
13 all their calculations there war not time for this 
but no they drew near the lobby there was inch a general with to walk along it once more all were of inclined and louisa noon grew so determined that the difference of a quarter of an hour it was found would he no difference at all 
to with all the kind leave-taking and all the kind interchange of invitation and promise which may be imagined they gained from captain and mr harville at their own not and still accompanied by captain benwick who seemed to cling tithes to the last proceeded to make the prove her adieu to the lobby

captain benwick obeyed and charles at the some moment dilengnging himself from his wife they were both with him

while captain wentworth staggering against the wall for his support exclaimed in the pinery agony

they had doubted forward and arranged everything before the others begun to reject 
captain benwick must give up hieroorntothem and get a bed elsewhere

mrs harville was a very experienced none and her nunery-maid who had lived with her long and one about with her everywhere was inch another 
when those two the could want no possible attendance by day or night 
and all this wan aid with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible 
charles henrietta and captain wentworth were the three in consultation and for i little while it wan only an interchange of perplexity and terror 
a uppercrou the necessity of some one going to utperenou

how it could be taken to mr and mr mangrove

but after a while captain went

he would he as little encumbrance a mile to captain and mrs harville i but a leaving his sister in web a state he neither ought nor would 
so far it was decided 
and henrietta it burst declared the same 
she however was noon intended to think differently 
the awfulness of her saying she who had not been able to remain in loni-3’s room or to look it her without mﬁ'eringl which made her worse than helpleul she wan forced to acknowledge that she could do no good yet was still unwilling to be away till touched by the thought of her father and mother she gave it up 3 she consented the me anxious to he at home 
the inn had reached this point when anne coming quietly down from louin’e room could not but hear what followed for the four door was a 
a then it is settled “negrove 1 cried wentworth that on my and that i take care of or finer home

he paused e moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself no spoken of 
the other two warmly agreed to what he laid and she then appeared

one thing more and all seemed arranged 
though it wan rather decline that mr and mr mugmve should be previously alarmed 3y name than of delay 
yet the time hired by the ppercrou home to take them hack wo d be a dreadful extension of expense 
and captain wentworth proposed and charles mangrove agreed that it would be much better for him to take a chain from the inn and leave mr mulgrove'n carriage and honor to he tent home the next morning early when there could he the farther advantage of ten in an account of louiaa’l night 
captain wentworth now hurried oil toget everything ready on his part and to he soon followed by the two ladies 
when the plan wan made known to mary however there wan an end of all presence in it 
she wan so wretched and no vehement tomphnined to much of injustice in being expected to go awnyinetcad of anne anne who wan nothing to louisa while she was her utter and had the bent right to nay in henrietta’t tread 
why was not the to be at useful as anne 
and to home without charles too without her husband of it wan too unkind 
and in short uh..uaid more than her husband could long withstood and ii none of the other could up when he gave way there war no help for it the c age of mary for anne wan inevitable 
anne had never lubmitted more reluctantly to the parlour and ill-judging claims of mary 
but no it man he and they act 03‘ for the town charles taking care of hit litter and captain benwick attending to her 
she gave a moment's recollection at they hurried along to the little circumstances which the name spot had persuasion 
1 19 witnessed earlier in the morning 
there she had listened to heurietta’s schemes for dr shirley’s leavin uppercmss 
further on she had first seen mr elliot 
a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but louisa or those who were wrapped up in her welfare 
captain benwick was most considerate attentive to her 
and united as they all seemed by the distress of the day she felt an increasing degree of good 
will towards him and a pleasure even in thinking that it might perhaps he the occasion of continuing their distance 
no wentworth was on the watch for them and a chain and four in waiting stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street 
but his evident 
surprise and vexation at the constitution of one sister for the other the change of his countenance the astonishment the sex ressions begun and suppressed with which charles was softened to made but a mortifying reception of anne 
or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to louisa 
she endeavoured to be composed and to be just 
without relating the feelings of an emma towards her henry she would have attended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard for his take 
and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to for she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend 
in the mean while she was in the carriage 
he had handed them both in and placed himself between them 
and in this manner under these circumstances full of astonishment and emotion to anne she quitted lyme 
how the long stage would pass 
how it was to predict their manners 
what was to be their sort of intercourse she could not foresee 
it was all quite natural however 
he was devoted to henrietta 
always turning i 20 persuasion 
toward 
her 
end when he spoke at all away with the view of supporting her ho and raising her its 
in general his voice and mhn’edner vac inglioutlyﬂlm 
to spare henrietta from agitation earned the governing principle 
once only when the had been grieving over the last ill-judged ill-fated walk to the lobby bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of he but forth at if wholly overcome 
a do n't talk of it don't talk of it a hurried 
a oh god 
that i had not given way to her at the fatal moment 
had i done an i ought 
but to eager and so resolutely dear sweet louisa i 
anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now to question the of hit own previous opinion an to the universe felicity and advantage of ﬁrmneu of character 
and whether it might not strike him that like all other quantities of the mind it should have its proportion and limits 
she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness an a very resolutely character 
they got on fat 
anne was astonished to recognised the lame hills and the name object to noon 
their actual tpeed length by iorne dread of the conduct made the road appear but half a long an on the day before 
it was growing quite dusk however before they were in the neighbourhood of uppercrou and there had been total iince among them for some time henrietta leaning back in the corner with a shawl over her face giving the hope of her having cried herself to deep 
when in they were going their last hill anne found herself all at once adorned by captain wentwimh 
in low cuntin voice he said 
a l have been considering what we had bent do 
she must not appear at lint 
she could not stand it 
i have been thinking whether you had not better rennin persuasion 
l i l in the carriage with her while i go in and break it to mr and mr mangrove 
do you think thin a good in it up she did he wan satisfied and said no more 
but the remembrance of the i remained a pleasure to her as a proof of friendship and of deference for her judgment 3 great pleasure 
and when it became a sort of naming proof in value did not lessen 
hen the dining communication at uppercrou was over and he had new the father and mother uite as cow a could he hoped and the daughter all the better or being with them he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to some 
and when the house were baited he war oil'wam 333 
be remainder of anne’s time at uppercrou comprehending only two days war spent en 
entirely at the union home 3 and ill had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely ueeful there both an an immediate companion and a sitting in all than arrangement for the future which in mr and mr muegrove’u distressed state of spirits would have been dillicultiee 
they had an early account from some the next morning 
louisa wan much the same 
no symptom wore than before had appeared 
charles came a few hour afterwards to bring a later and more particular account 
he was tolerably cheerful 
a speedy cure must not be ho but everything was going on ill well ii the nature of the case admitted 
in speaking of the harville he ieemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness especially of my harville’a evening a l i 2 rmutsron 
a tune 
she really left nothing for mary to do 
he and mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last i ht 
mary had been hysterics again this morning 
hen he came away the me going to walk out with captain benwick which he he would do her good 
he almost wished the had prevailed on to come home the day before 
but the truth wet that mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do 
charles wan to return to l me the tame afternoon and hit father had at lint half a mind to with him but the ladies could not content 
it wo d be going only to multiply trouble to the others and income hit own dittrett 
and a much better tcheme followed and wan acted upon 
a chaise was tent for from crewkheme and charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family one who having brought up all the children and seen the very last the line energy and loug-petted matter harry tent to elton at 
a hit brothert wan now living in her deterred courtesy to mend ttocltingt and drew all the faint and bruitet the could get near her and who consequently was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurte dear miss louisa 
vague wishes of getting salah thither had occurred before to mrs mangrove and henrietta 
but without anne it would hardly have been reserved on and found practicable to noon 
they were indebted the next do to charles walter for all the minute knowledge of out which it was to essential to obtain every twenty-four heart 
he made it hit business to go to some and hit account was still encouraging 
the interval of sense and conscience were believed to be stronger 
every report agreed in captain wentworth appearing fixed in some 
anne was to leave them on the morrow an event which they all dreaded 
a what should they do without her 
they were wretched comforter for one anpersuasion 
i 23 other 
and so much was said in thin way that anne thought the could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which he wan privy and persuade them all to go to some at once 
she had little difficulty 
it was soon determined that they would go go to-morrow ix tlrcmnelvcn at the inn or get into lod ago as it united and then remain till dear louisa con d be moved 
they must be taking off some trouble from the and is the war with they might at least relieve re hamle from the care of her own children and in short they were so happy in the decision that anne wan delighted with what the had done and felt that she could not spend her lm morning at uppercrou better than in assisting their preparations and sending them of 
at an early hour though her being left to the solitary range of the house wan the consequence 
she wan the last exec king the little boys at the cottage the was the vary at the only remaining one of all that had called and animated both houses of all that had given uppercrou its cheerful character 
a few day 
had made a change indeed 
if louisa recovered it would all be well again 
more than former happiness would be restored 
there could not be i do t to her mind there we none of what would follow her recovery 
a few month hence and the room now so deeerted occupied but by her silent 
service all miss ht be called again with all that was happy and gay all that won glowing and bright in rlolgperl'oul love all that was most unlike anne not an hour's com lcte leisure for such reflections at three on i dark li‘lovemher day i small thick rain all-non blotting out the very few objects ever to be dispersed from the window was enough to make the sound of lady ruuell’a carriage exceedingly welcome 
l ray msunsrou 
and thou h desirous to be gone the could not quit the action cause or look on adieu to the cottage widi ita black dripping and eomfonleu veranda or even notice through the mist glance the man humble atonement of the village without a saddened heart 
sooner had paced in speech which made it precioua 
it mod the rector of many lenntiooe of pain once severe but now softened 
and of some instances of relenting feeling iorne hreathinga of friendship and reconciliation which could never be looked for again and which could never ensue to he dear 
she left it all behind her all but the recollection that such things had been 
anne had never entered kell ch iince her quitting lady ruuell'a house in september 
it had not been necessary and the few ocouiona of its being months for her to go to the hall ll 
had contrived to evade and escape from 
her lines return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartment of the lodge and to ladies the eyes of in more 
there wan some anxiety mixed with lad runell'l joy in meeting her 
she knew who had been repeating uppercrou 
but happily either anne wan improved in plumpness and looks or lady russell fancied her to 
and anne 
in receiving her compliments on the occasion had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin and of hoping that she was to be pleased with a second spring of youth and infamy 
hen they came to convert the wan noon sensible of lame mental change 
the subject of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch and which the had felt slighted and been compelled to another among the mulgroveu were now become but of secondary intereat 
she had lately lort right even of her father and finery and bath 
their concerns had been sunk under pmussrow 
a 5 those of uppercmes 
and when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears and spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place which had been taken and regret that mrs clay should still be with them anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of hymen and louisa mangrove and all her acquaintance there 
how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the harville and captain benwick than her own father s house in camden place or her own sisters intimacy with mrs clay 
she was actually forced to exert herself to meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude on topics which had by nature the first claim on her 
there was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject 
they must all of the accident at 
some 
lady russell had not a arrived ve minutes the day before when a full account of the whole had burst on her 
but still it must be talked of she must make enquiries she must regret the impm 
dence lament the result and captain wentworth’s name must be mentioned by both 
anne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell 
she could not speak the name and look straight forward to lady russell’s e e till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa 
when this was told his name distressed her no longer 
lady russell had only to listen composedly and wish them happy but internally her heart revolted in angry pleasure in leased contempt that the man who at twenty-three ha seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an anne elliot should eight years afterwards be charmed by a louisa mangrove 
the list three or four days passed most quietly with no circumstance to mark them excepting the real 36 persuasion 
kept of a note or two from limes which found their way to anne the could not tell how 
and thought rather improving account of sending 
at the 
end of that period lady runell'a politeneu could resolve no longer and the fainter cell-threatening of the st became in a decided tone i must call on mrs rnl't 
i really inuat call upon her soon 
anne have you coun e to go with meand pay a visit in that house 
it wi be some trial to no other anne did not shrink from it on the contrary the early felt no the laid in observing 
a i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two 
your feelings are lest reconciled to the change than mine 
by remaining in the neighbourhood i am become inured to it she could have said more on the subject for she had in fact so high an opinion of the croft and considered her father to very fortunate in hit tenants felt the parish to he to cure of a good example and the poor of the best mention and relief that however in 
and ashamed for the necessity of the removal the court d not but in conscience feel that they were one who deserved not to stay and that kellynch half had passed in better hand than its owners 
these convictions must unquettionahly have their own pain and never war it kind 
but they precluded that pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house again and returning through the well-known apartments 
in such moments anne had no power of saying to herself 
these rooms ought to belong only to us 
oh how fallen in their destination 
how unworthin occupiedl an ancient family to he so driven away 
strangers ﬁlling their place 
a no except when the thought of her mother and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside she had no sigh of that description to have 
persuasion 
l 21 mrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite and on the present occasion receiving her in that house there via-lparticular attention 
the accident at some was soon the prevailing topic and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yettennom 
that captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday the list time since the accident had brought anne the last note which the had not been able to trace the exact steps of 
had staid a cup houryan d thenretumedagainto hymen and without any present intention of quitting it any more 
he had enquired after her she found particularly 
had ex crossed his hope of nice elliot’s not being the worse 
far her examine and had spoken of there exertions as great 
this was handsome and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done 
as to the sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of my sensible women whoee judgments had to work on ascertained events 
and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtfulness and much imprudcnce 
t is effect were most alarming and that it wan frightfiil to think how long miu nfusgrove s recove might yet he doubtful an how liable she would nil remain to out 
a from the caucus-ion hereafter 
the admiral wound it all up luminarin by exclaiming 
a ay a very bad business indeed 
a new sort of way thin for a young fellow to be making love by breaking hit mistrcae’e head is not it miss elliot 
this in breaking a head and giving a planted tnrlyl 
admiral crot't’u manners were not quite of the tone to suit lad russell but the delighted anne 
his goodness oly heart and simplicity of character were irreeietiblc 
18 persuasion 
now thin must be very bad for you laid lie luddenl rousing from a little reverie to be coming and ii in us here 
i had not recollected it before i declare but it 
must be very bad 
but now do not and upon ceremony 
get up and go over all the rooms in the home if you like it 
a another time sir i thank you 
not now a 1 well whenever it wit you 
you can lips in from the shrubbery at any time 
and there you will and we keep our umbrellahan ing up by that door 
a good place in not it 
but a checking himself you will not think it a good place 
for your were always kept in the battle 
room 
ay no it always ll i believe 
one means way 
may be at good a incl-her’l but we all like our own belt 
and no you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for you to go about the home or note or manner lending the might decline it did it very grate e we have made very few changes either continued the admin-4| after thinking a moment 
very few 
we told you about the laundry-door at uppercrou 
that has been a very great improvement 
the wonder wan how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of it opening an it did it long 
you will tell sir walter what we have done and that mr shepherd thinks the greatest improvement the house ever had 
indeed i moat do ourselves the justice to any that the few alteration 
we have made have been all very much for the better 
my wife should have the credit of them however 
i have done very little besides tending away fame of the large looking-glam from my dmaing-mom which was your father 
a very good man and very much the gentlemen i am sure 
but i should think miss elliot 
looking with serious reflection i ihould think he must be rather i nusunsrorw 
15 dreuy man for his time of life 
such a number of looking-glam 
oh lord 
there was no getting am from one half 
so i got sophia to lend me a banks and we noon thifred their quarters 
and now i am quite snug with my little shaving-glain one corner and another great thing that i never go near anne amused in spite ofhereelf wan rather distressed for an answer 
and the admiral fearing he might not have been civil enough took up the subject again to m ye the next time you write to your good father miss elliot pray give my compliments and mr 
crowds and that we are settled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to and with the lace 
the breakfast-room chimney makes a little grant on but it in only when the wind ll due north and bovii hard which may not happen three time 
a winter 
and take it altogether now that we have been into most of the bonnet hereahoute and an judge there in not one that we like better than this 
pray say no with my compliments 
he will be glad to hear it 
lady russell and croft were very well pleased with each other but the acquaintance which the visit began was fated not to proceed far at relent 
for when it will returned the grants announced themselves to he going away for a few weeks to visit their connexion in the north of the county and probably might not be at home again before lady russell would be removing to bath 
so ended all danger to anne of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hall or of seeing him in com 
pang with her friend 
everything was safe enough and she raised over‘the many anxious feeling the had wanted on the subject 
130 rensuasron 
chapter 27 
though charleind ma had remained at some much longer after s and mr muegrove'l going than anne conceived they could have been at all wanted they were yet the list of the family to be at home again 
and at noon at possible after their return to us percrote they drove over to the lodge 
they had led r. louisa be sing to lit up 
but her had though clear wan exce ingly weak and her nerve perceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness 
and though ill might be renounced to be altogether doing very well it wan nil impossible to say when the might be able to hear the removal home 
and her father and mother who must return in time to receive their younger children for the crimson holidayn had hardly a ha of being allowed to bring her with them 
they ha been all in lodgings together 
mrs mungmve had got mrs harvillc’r children away i much as the could every possible iupply from uppercrou had been furnish to lie hate the inconvenience to the harville while the allen had been wanting them to come to dinner every day 
and in short it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side at to which could be most disinterested and hospitable 
mary had had her evil but upon the whole as wan evident by her staying so long she had found more to enjoy than to taller 
charlehayter had been at l me oftener than suited her 
and when they dined with the harville there had been only a man-servant to wait and at first mrs harville had always given me mangrove precedence 
but then the had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out where daughter the was and there had been so much going on every day there had been no many walkmuseum 
1 
between their lodgings and the harville and she had got books from the library and changed them so often that the balance had certainly been much in favour of some 
she had been taken to charlotte too and she had bathed and she had gone to church and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at some than at uppercrou 
and all this joined to the sense of being so very useful had made really an agreeable fortnight 
anne in uired after captain benwick 
mary s face was clouded directly 
charles laughed 
oh 
captain benwick is very well i believe but he is a very odd young man 
i do not know what he would be at 
we asked him in come home with ml for a day or two charles undertook to ve him come shooting and he seemed quite delighted and for my part i thought it was all settled when boldly on thursday night he made a very awkward sort of an excuse 
he never shot 1 and he had been quite milundemood 1 and he had promised this and he had promised that and the end of it was i found that he did not mean to come 
i sup sea he was afraid of sending it dull 
but upon my wo i should have though 
we were lively enough at the cottage for such a heartbroken man as ca tain benwick.’ charles laugh again and said now ma you know very well how it really was 
it was all your doing a turning to anne 
e fancied that if he went with us he should end on close by he fancied everybody to be living in ppercross 
and when he discovered that lady russell lived three mile of his heart failed him and he had not courage to come 
that is the fact upon my honour 
mary knows it is but mary did not give into it very graciously whether from not considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation to begin love with an elliot or from not want 32 persuasion 
in 
to believe anne a greater attraction to uppercrou than here must be left to be guessed 
anne goodwill however war not to be lessened by what she heard 
she boldly acknowledged herself flattered and consoled her nieces 
soul he use of you cried charles in arch terrm 
mary interrupted him 
i declare charles i never heard him mention anne twice all the time wan there 
i declare anne he never talked of you at all 
a no ndmitted charles 1 i do not know that he ever does in a general way 
but however it in a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly 
his head in full of come books that he in reading upon your recommendation and he wants to talk to you about them 
he he found out something or other in one of them which he thinks 
oh 
i can not pretend to remember it but it am something very one 
i overheard him telling henrietta all about it 
and then a miss elliot’s was spoken of in the highest terms now mary i declare it was to i heard it myself 
and you were in the other room 
a sly ance iweetneu beanty.’ oh 
there war no end of in elliot’s charml 
and i am sure cried mary warmly it was very little to his credit if he did 
miss harville only died last june 
such a heart it very little worth having in it lady russell 
i am cure you will agree with me 
a i men are coming benwick before i decide laid lady russell am my 
a and that you are very likely to do very noon i can tell you ma'am laid charles 
a though he had not never for coming away with m and setting off again afterwards to yes a formal visit here 
he will make his way over to ellynch one day by himself you ma depend on it 
i told him the distance and the road 
persuasion 
i 33 and i told him of the church s being so very well worth seeing 
for an he has a taste for those sort of things i thou hat that would be a good excuses and he listened with l his depending and soul 
and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon 
so i give you notice lady russell 
a any acquaintance of anne’s will be always welcome to me a wan lady ruuell’l kind answer 
a oh i an to being anne’s acquaintance 1 said mary 1 i think he it rather my acquaintance for i have been ieeing him every day thin last fortnight 
a well as your 
aim acquaintance then i shall be very happy to see pain benwick 
a you will not and anything ve agreeable in him i nature you ma'am 
he in one of the dullest young men that ever lived 
he has walked with me sometimes from one end of the and w the other without saying a word 
he in not at all a well-bred young man 
i am sure you will not like him 
a there we differ mary laid anne 
i think lady russell would like him 
i think the would be no much pleased with his mind that she would very noon see no deficiency in his manner a so do i anne laid charles 
i am sure lady russell would like him 
he in june lady russell s sport 
give him a book and he will read all day long 
yes 
that he will i a replied mary tauntingly 
a he will sit poring over his book and not know when a person speak 
to him or when one drop 
one lesson or anything that happens 
do you think lady russell would like that i 
lady russell could not help laughing 
a upon my word said she 
i ihould not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such differ 
once of conjecture speedy and matter of fact at i may ray ensuasron 
call myself 
have really ourioitytonee the person who can give union to inch directly opposing notion 
l with he may be indncodlo all here 
and when he does mary you may depend hearing my opinion hulamdeteminednotlojdehimbeforehand.’ 1 you will not like him 
i will answer for it 
lady russell began talking of something clue 
mary spoke with animation of their meeting with or rather midng mr elliot io extraordinarily 
he in a man mid lady russell 1 whom i have no wish to lee 
his declining to he on cordial term with the head of his family has left a very mung impression in his diafavonr with me 
this deception checked mag eagerness and named her short in the midst of the list countenance 
with regard to captain wentworth though anne haurded no inquiries there was voluntary communication tuflicient 
his spirits had been greatly recovering lately i might be expected 
a louisa improved he had improved and he wan now nite a different cream from what he had been the 1 week 
he had not seen louisa 
and was an extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview that he did not press for it at all 
and on the contrary seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days till her head was stronger 
he had talked of going down to plymouth fury a week and wanted to made captain benwick to go with him 
but an harlet maintained to the man 
captain benwick leaned much more disposed to ride over to kellynch 
there can be no doubt that lad russell and anne were both oecalionnlly thinking of captain benwick from thin time 
lady russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be hit herald 
nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary inplnsnssxon 
135 silence in her father s grounds or any visit of charity in the village without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him 
ca rain benwick came not however 
he was either ecu disposed for it than charles had imagined or he was too shy 
and after giving him a week's indulgence lady russell determined him to he unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite 
the mud roves came back to receive their ha y boys and from school bringing with them as hsrville’s little children to improve the noise of uppercrou and lessen that of some 
henrictu remained with louisa but all the rest of the family were again in their usual uarters 
lady russell an anne did their compliments to them once when anne cnultia not but feel that uppercrou was already quite alive again 
though neither henrietta nor louisa nor charles walter nor captain wentworth were there the room presented as strong a contrast as could he wished to the last state she had seen it in 
immediame surrounding mrs musgroee were the little hnrvillcs whom she was scdulously guarding from the by on of the two children from the cottage expressly to amuse them 
on one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls cutting up ill and gold per 
and on the other were actresses and says hen ng under the weight of brown and cold pies where riotous boys were holding high revel 
the whole completed by a hearing christmaﬁre which seemed determined to he heard in spite of all the noise of the others 
charles and mary also came in of course during their visit and mr mangrove made a point of paying his respects to lady russell and sat down close to her for ten minutes talking with i very raised voice but from the colour of the children on his t36 persuasion 
knees generally in vain 
it was 
a one familyanne judging from her own temperament would have deemed such a comedy hurricane a had restorative of the nerve which louia’t illneat must have it greatly shaken 
but my mulgmve who got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially again and again for all her attention to them concluded a short recapitulan'oo of what the had suffered herself by observing with a happy glance round the room that after all the had gone through nothing wan to likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulneu at home 
louisa wan now recovering space 
her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home before her brother and deter 
wit to cool again 
the harville had promised to come with her and ray at uppercrou whenever the returned 
captain wentworth wan gone for the present to are his brother in shropshire 
1 hope i shall remember in future laid lady russell ll soon at the were relented in the carriage not to call at ppercroel in the chriunuu h idaya.” everybody has their taste in noise as well up in other matters 
and sounds are quite innnxiom or most distressing 
by their tort rather than their scanty 
when lady rum not long afterwards wal entering bath on a wet afternoon and driving through the long court of meet from the old bridge to camden place amidst the due of other carriage the heavy tumbler of calm and days the barking of news mufﬁn-men and miller and the cent-lets cloak of pattern she made no complaint 
no then were sailor which belonged to the winter plonturet 
her spirits rate under their influence 
and like mrs mangrove she was feeling though not saying that after being long in the rusmsron 
131 cousin s couldheao forherualittle pray miss 200 anne did not there these feelings 
she 2 in a very determined though very silent dieine nation for bath 
caught the hot dim view of the extensive buildings making in mind without any wish of ieeing them better 
felt their progress through the meet to be however disagreeable yet too rapid 
for who would be glad to lee her when she arrived 
and looked back with fond regret to the borders of uppercrou and the exclusion of kellynch 
elizabeth last letter had communicated a piece of new of some interest 
mr elliot war in bath 
he had called in camden place 
had called a second time i third 
had been pointedly attentive 
if elizabeth and her father did not deceive them-clue had been taking an much pain to seek the acquaintance and proclaim the value of the connection at he had formerly taken paint to show neglect 
thin was very wonderful if it were true 
and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about mr elliot already reckoning the sentiment she had no lately expressed to ma of ill being a man whom she had no with to ice 
a she had a great with to see him 
if he really caught to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he sat he for even for having diamembered himself from the poem tree 
anne wan not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance but the felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not which was more than she could any for many other persons in bath 
she wan put down in camden place and lady russell then drove to her own lodgings in riven street

i walter had taken a we good house in camden place a soft digniﬁ situation such ll becomes a man of consequence 
and both he and elizabeth were settled there much to their satisfaction 
anne entered it with a sinking hart anticipating an imprinnrnent of many months and anxiously saying to herself oh 
when shall i leave you again 
a degree of unexpected cordiality however in the welcome the received did her good 
her father and deter were glad to see her for the sake of ieeing her the home and ﬁimiturc and met her with kindness 
her making a fourth when they sat down to dinner was noticed a an advantage 
my clay wan v pleasant and very smiling but her eourteaiea and us as were more a matter of course 
anne had any felt that the would pretend what wan proper on her arrival but the complaisance of the other was unlocked for 
they were evidently in excellent spirits and the wan soon to linen to the meet 
they had no inclination to linen to her 
after laying out for some compliment of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood which anne could not pay they had only a few faint inquiries to make before the talk must be all their own 
uppercrou excited no interest kellynch very little it were all bath 
they had the pleasure of securing her that bath more than answered their expectations in every respect 
their home was undoubtedly the best in camden place their drawing-room many decided advantage over all the other which they had either been or heard of and the m riority wan not ice in the at leg of the ﬁtting-up or t taste of the furniture 
heir persuasion 
35 acquaintance wan exceedingly nought after 
everybody wan wanting to visit them 
they had drawn back from many introduction and still were perpetually having card left by people of whom they knew nothing 
here were found enjoyment 
could anne wonder that her father and sister were hoping she might not wonder but the man might that s father ihould feel no degradation in his change would see nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the recent landholder ihould find no much to vain of in the littleneuea of a town 
and the most lights and smile and wonder too as elizabeth threw open the foldingdoon and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to the other coming of their space at the possibility of that woman who had been mistress of kellynch hall ending extent to be proud of between two walla perhapo thirty feet asunder 
but this was not all which they had to make them ha py 
they had mr elliot too 
anne had i great deal to hear of mr elliot 
he was not only pardoned they were delighted with him 
he had been in bath about afortnight 
he had used through bath in november in hit way to long on when the intelligence of sir walter’s being settled there had of course reached him though only twenty-four hour in the place but he had not been able to avail himself of it 
but he had now been a fortnight ht in bath and his list object on arriving had been joined his card in camden lilace following it up b iueh uniduout endeavours to meet and when they did meet by each great openness of conduct such readiness to apologize for the past inch solicitude to he received m a relation again that their former good understanding was completely re-eetablithed 
they had not a fault to end in him 
he had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own k 30 finder 1 
aide 
it had originated in minpprehenlion entirely 
he had never had an idea of throwing himself of t he had feared that he was thrown off but knew not why and delicacy had kept him silent 
upon the hint of having spoken diareapectfully or careless of the family and the family honour he wan quite indignant 
he who had ever bosoms of being an elliot and whose feelings at to connection were only too attack to unite the unusual tone of the present day 
he wan iitoniohed indeed but his character and general conduct mint refute it 
he could refer sir walter to all who knew him 
and certainly the pains he had been taking on thin the fit up purity of reconciliation tobe rentnred w the footing of relation and heirreeumptive war a strong proof of hit opinion on the estate circumstance of his marriage too were found to admit of much cxtenuation 
thin was an article not to be entered on by himself 
but a very intimate friend of he a colonel wallis a highly re culpable in perfectly the gentleman and nor 
an is looking man sir walter added who was living in very good style in marlborough buildings and had at his own particular retreat been admitted to their acquaintance through mr else it had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage which made a material difference in the discredit of it 
colonel wallis had known mr elliot long had been well acquainted also with his wife had perfectly understood the whole story 
she was certainly not a woman of family but well educated accomplithed rich and excessively in love with his friend 
there had been the charm 
she had taught him 
without that attraction not all her money would have tempted elliot and sir walter was moreover natured of her having been a very one woman 
here was a great deal to often the banners 
a very one woman with a large fortune in persvasion.‘ 1 love with him sir walter seemed to admit it as complete apology 
and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light she allowed it to be a great extenuation 
mr elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for they gave no dinners in 
general 
delighted in short by every proof of cousins notice and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in camden place 
anne listened but without quite understanding it 
allowances large allowances must be made for the ideas of those who spoke 
she heard it all under embellishment 
all that sounded extravagantorimtional in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the regulators 
still however she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared 
in mr elliot’s wishing after an interval of so many years to be well received by them 
in a worldly view he had nothing to gain by being on terms with sir walter 
nothing to risk by a state of variance 
in all probability he was already the richer of the two and the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title 
a sensible man and he had looked like a any sensible man why should it be an object to him 
she could only offer one resolutions it was pity for elizabeth sake 
there might really have a sitting former 
though convenience and accident had drawn him a die rent way 
and now that he could afford to lease himself he mi ht mean to pay his addresses to her 
elizabeth was certain y veryhsndsome 
with wellbred elegant manners and her character might never have been penetrated by mr elliot knowing her but in public and when very young himself 
how her temper and understanding might hear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and its 
weston 
rather fearful one 
most earnestly did the with that he might not be too nice or too nbaervant if elizabeth were hit object 
and that elizabeth wan to believe herself in and that her friend mr lay wan encouraging the idea seemed apparent by a glance or two between them while mr elliot’s frequent visits were talked of 
anne mentioned the glimpcea the had had of him at same but without being much attended to 
oh yes perhaps it had been mr elliot 
they did not know 
it might be him perhaps 
they could not linen to her dear riot of him 
they were driving him themeelvee 
sir walter especially 
he did justice to hit very gentlemanlike up see his air of elegance and fashion his good-aha face he eenlible eye 
but at the same time a most lament his being vary much under-hung a defect which time seemed to have intruded 
nor could he pretend to nay that ten year had not altered almost every feature for the want 
mr elliot appeared to think that he sir walter war looking exactly a he had done when they last parted 
but sir walter had a not been able to return the compliment entirely which had embarraued him 
he did not mean to complain however 
mr elliot was better to look at than most men and he had no objection to he seen with him anywhere mr elliot and his friend 
in marlborou h buildings were talked of the whole evening 
so once wallis had been to impatient to be introduced to them and mr elliot is anxious that he ihould l 1 and there was 3 mn wallis at present known only to them by description at ill wan in daily expectation of her conﬁnemcnt 
but mr elliot spoke of her an 1 a most charm in woman quite worthy of being known in camden place and at noon ache recovered the were to be acquainted 
sir walter thought much of my wallis 
nasmsrorr 
18 she was it to he an excessively pretty woman henntiful 
a he longed to see her 
e she might make some amends for the many very ain faces hewae continually passing in the streets 
life worst of bath was the number of its plain women 
he did not mean to say that there were no pretty women but the number of the plain wan out of all proportion 
he had frequently observed as he walked that one handsome face would be followed by thirty or live-and-thirty fright 
and once as he had wood m a shop in bond street he had counted eighty-seven women go by one after another without there being a tolerable face among them 
it had been a pretty morning to be sure a sharp front which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of 
but still there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath 
and as for the men 
they were infinitely worse 
such scarecrowat the streets were full of 
it was evident how little the women were used to the eight of anything tolerable by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced 
he had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with colonel wallis who was no one military sure though sandy-haired without observing that every woman's eye was upon him 
every woman's c was sure to be upon colonel wallis 
modest sir alter 
he was not allowed to escape however 
his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting that colonel wallises corn son might have 1 good a sure as colonel wallis and certain was not and hatred 
a how in mary ooking 
a i sir walter in the height of his good humour 
6 the inn time i saw her she had a red note but i hope that my not happen every day 
a oh 
no that must have been quite accidental 
in neral she has been in very good health and very good god since michaelmas 7th rnasuasrou 
a if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in happy wind and grow case i would lend her a new hat and polite 
anne wan wondering whether the ihould venture to suggest that a gown 
or a can would not be liable to any week mine when i knock at the door i ended every 
thing 
a knock at the door 
and no lately it was ten o'clock 
could it be mr elliot 
they knew he was to dine in london crescent 
it was possible that he might lamp in hit way home to ask them how they did 
they could think of no one else 
my clay decidedly thou ht it mr elliot’s knocking my clay wan right 
it all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give mr elliot wan ushered into the room 
it was the tame the very same man with no difference but of dress 
anne drew a little back while the others received his compliments and her litter hit apologies for calling at no unulual an hour but a he could not be to near without wishing to know that neither the nor her friend had taken cold the day before sum as 
which was all in politely done and no politely taken ll possible but her part must follow then 
sir walter talked of miss youngest daughter 
a mr elliot must give him leave to present him to all oungett dau sister there we no occasion for remembering maryj‘ 
and anne smiling and blushing very becoming owed to mr elliot the rest features which he had by no meant forgotten an instantly view with amusement at hit little start of surprise that he had not been at all aware of who the war 
he looked completel astonished but not more astonished than pleated ltit eyes brightened 
and with the most rfect thicrity he welcomed the relationthip allude to the plan and annesley to be revived 15 an acquaintance already 
he was quite as good-looking as he had appersuasion 
r45 parted at some llll countenance improved by speaking and his manners were to exactly what they ought to be no polished to easy to early agreeable that she could compare them in excellence to only one pemn’e rnannen 
they were not the tame but they were perhaps e only good 
he eat own with them and in raved their conversation very much 
there could no doubt of his being a sensible man 
ten minutes were enough to certainty that 
hit tone his expressions his choice of subject his knowing where to stop it was all the operation of a sensible ditcerning mind 
as soon to he could he began to talk to her of some wanting to compare opinion respecting the place but especially wanting to walk of the circumstance of their happening to he guest xi the lame inn it the tame time 
to give his own route understand something of here and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her 
she gave him a short account of her party and business at some 
his regret increased at he listened 
he had spent his whole eolitary evening in the room adjoining theirs 
had heard voices mirth continually 
thought they must be a most delightful net of people longed to be with them but certainly without the smallest suspicion of miss king the shadow of i right to introduce himself 
f he had but uked who the party were 
the name of mir-grove would have told him enough 
a well it would nerve to cure him of to bear practice of never taking a question it an inn which he had adopted when quite e young men on the principle of its being very ungenteel to be curious 
the notion 
of a young men of one or two and twenty said he so to what ll neoconry in manner e him unite the thing are more absurd i believe than those of my other set of being in the world 
l 46 persuasion 
the folly of the means they often employ in only to he equalled by the folly of what they have in view but he must not be addressing his reﬂectionto anne alone he knew it 
he was noon dilfueed again among the other and it wan only at intervals that he could return to some 
his enquiries however produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there soon after hit leaving the place 
having alludedto 1 an accident he must hear the whole 
when he questioned sir walter and elizabeth began to question also but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be an 
felt 
she could only compare mr elliot to lady rune“ in the with of really comprehending what had paused and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it 
he said an hour with them 
the elegant little clock on the mantel-piece had struck a eleven with it silver ioundl 
and the coachman wan beginning to he heard 1t 3 dimnec telling the lame talc before mr elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long 
anne could not have supposed it possible that her lines evening in camden place could have passed so well 
chapter 34 
here was one point which anne on returning to her family would have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliot’s being in love with elizabeth which war her futhcr’l not being in love with an clay 
and she war very far from easy about it when she had been at home a few hours 
on going down to breakfast the next morning 
the found pirsuasioii‘ 
17 there had just been a decent pretence on the lady side of meaning to leave them 
she could imagine mrs clay to have said that now miss anne was come she could not suppose herself at all wanted 
for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper that must not be any reason indeed 
i assure you i feel it none 
she is nothing to me compared with you 
and she was in full time to hear her father say a my dear madam this must not be 
as yet you has seen nothing of bath 
a you have been here only to be useful 
you must not run away from us now 
you must stay to beacup'ainted with us wallis the beautiful mrs wallis 
of our line mind i well know the sight of beauty is a gratiﬁcation.” he spoke and looked so much in earnest 
that anne was not surprised to see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself 
her countenance perhaps might ex res some watchfulness 
but the praise of the one mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister 
the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties and promise to stay 
in the course of the same morning anne and her father chancing to be alone to either he began to compliment her on her impm looks 
he thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks 
her skin her complexion greatly improved 
clearer fresher 
had she been usin anything in particular 
no nothing 
merely morland a he supposed 
a no nothing at all 
has he was surprised at that 
and added a certainly you can not do better than continue as you ire 
you can not be better than well 
or i should recommend gown the constant use of norland during the spring months 
m11 clay has been using it at my recommendation and you see what it solid done for her 
you see how it has carried away her freckles.” ray reasuaswx 
if elizabeth could but have heard this such personal praise might have struck her especially at it did not appear to anne that the fickle were at all learned 
but everything must take in chance 
the evil of the marriage would be much diminished if elizabeth were also to marry 
as for herself the might always command a home with lady rune“ 
lady runeil’a composed mind and polite manners were put to come trial on thin point in her intercourse in camden place 
the eight of delay in inch favour and of anne i overlooked was a perpetual pmvocation to her there 
and vexed her ll much when the war way up a person in bath who drink the water gets all the new publication and hat a very large acquaintance has time to be vexed 
as mr elliot became known to her the grew more charitable or more indifferent toward the other 
hit manner were an immediate recommendation 
and on converting with him the found the sold so fully ai porting the mperﬁcial that the way at first an the to d anne almost ready to exclaim 
can thin be mr elliot 
a and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or eatimahle man 
everything united in him 
good understanding correct opiniona knowledge of the world and a warm heart he had strong feelings family attachment and family honour 
without pride or weakneu 
he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune without display 
he judged ed for himself in everything essential without design 
public opinion in any point of worldly decorum 
he war stead oboervant moderate 
candid 
never my away with my spirits or by ielﬁahneu which fancied himself rang feeling 
and yet with a iemihility to what wan amiable and lovely and a value for all the felicities of domestic life which character of fancied enthuiiaarn and violent agitation teldorn really poueu 
she was tune that he rnnsuesrorr 
rug had not been happy in mania e. colonel wallis-aid it and lady russell saw it 
at it had been no use 
to your his mind nor she an noon palirqnct to prevent his thinking afﬁxeecgnrf‘lughoioe 
her at action in mr elliot outweigh all the plague of my clay 
it wan now some years since anne had begun to learn that he and her excellent friend could iometinieu think differently 
and it did not surprise her therefore that lady rune“ ehould lee nothing auspicioua or incontinent nothing to require more mou'vea than appeared in mr elliot’s great desire of reconciliation 
a lady runell’r view it we 
perfectly natural that mr elliot at a mature time of li should feel it a most desirable object and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people to be on good terms with the head of his 
family 
the simple prompt in the world of time upon a head naturelly clear and only stirring in the heyday of youth 
anne premmed however still to smile about it and at last to mention 
elizabeth 
lady russell listened and looked and made only this ceuu'oue reply 
elizabeth 
very well 
time will explain it were l reference to the future which anne after a little observation 
fell the must submit to 
she could determine nothing at present 
in that house elizabeth must be lint 
and the was in the habit of much general oboervance an 
miss elliot 1 that any particularity of attention ieemed almost impossible 
mr elliot too it must be remembered l'lld not been a widower aeven month 
a little delay on his ride might be very inexcusable 
in fact anne could never lee the scrape round his hat without fearing that the war the inexcusable one in attributing to him such imagination for though his marriage had not been very happy till it had existed in many eliza that the could not compare 15o rensuesxon 
have ran reoov fromthelwﬁtlim s of it beingdi-glived 
a 1 1 however it might end he wan without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in bath the saw nobody equal to him 
and it was great indulgence now and then to talk to him about limes which he seemed to have ll lively a wish to see again and to see more of at herself 
they went through the particular of their first meeting a great many times 
he gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some untestneu 
she knew it well 
and the remembered another pem n't look alto 
they did not always think alike 
hit value for rank and connexion the perceived to be greater than hen 
it was not merely complainance it must he a liking to the came which made him enter warmly into her father and fitter solicitude on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them 
the bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the dowager viecountcu dalrymple and her daughter the honourable mitt carteret 
and all the comfort of no 
— camden place 
was kept away for many days 
for the dalryrnplel in anyone opinion most unfortunately were cousin of the elliott 
and the agony was how to introduce themaelvet properly 
anne had never seen her father and sister before in contrast with nobility and the most acknowled e herself dinppointed 
she had hoped better thing mm their high ideas of their own situation in life and was reduced no form a with which the had never forgotten 
a with am they had more pride 
for your cousins 
lady dalrymple and miss carteret 
a 1 our continual palrym rice loundcrl in her care all day long 
sir alter had once been in company with the late mum but had never seen any of the rest of the the difficulties of the case arose from there persuasion 
i 5 i having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late viscount when in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir matters at the same time there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch 
no letter of condolence had been sent to ireland 
the neglect had been visited on the head of the skinners 
for when poor lady elliot died herself no letter of condolence was received at kellynch and consequently there was but too much reason to s present that the dalrymple considered the relationalin as closed 
how to have this anxious busineu set to rights and be admitted as cousins again was the question and it was a question which in a more rational manner neither lady russell nor mr elliot thought unimportant 
a family connexions were always worth reserving good company always worth seeking 
lady alr place had taken a house for three months in laura lace and would be living in style 
she had been at bath the year before and lady russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman 
it was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed if it could be done without any compromise of propriety on the side of the elliot 
sir walter however would choose his own means and at last wrote a very one letter of ample ex lanation regret and entreaty to his right honourable e cousin 
neither lady russell nor mr elliot could admire the letter 
but it did all that was wanted in bringing three lines of screams from the dowager viscountess 
she was very much honoured and should be happy in their acquaintance the toils of the business were over the sweets began 
they visited in laura place they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrymple and the honourable miss career to be arranged wherever they might be most visible and a our cousins in laura place 
— a our cousins lady dalrymple and miss carteret 1 were talked of to everybody 
15a ammo 
anne was ashamed 
had lady dalrym lee and her daughter even been very agreeable the soul will have been ashamed of the agitation they created but they were nothing 
there was no superiority of manner 
accomplishment or nndemanding 
lady dalrym lee had acquired the name of a charming woman all the had a mile and a civil answer r everybody 
mice carteret with will lean to lay wan to plain and so awkward 
that the would never have been tolerated in camden place but for her birth 
lady russell confessed that ill had expected something better 
but yet it was an acquaintance worth having 
and when anne ventured to kiss her opinion of them to mr elliot he agreed to their being nothing in themselves but still maintained that at a family connexion a good comes my at there who would collect good can say around them they had their value 
anne smiled and’amd 
a my idea of good company mr elliot it the company of clever well-informed people who have a great d of conversation 
that is what i call good corn ny 
a ou ire mistake a said he gently 1 that in not good company 
that ll the but 
good company requirel on my irth education and manners and with regard to education is not very nice 
birth and good manners are euenﬁnl 
but a little learning it by no means a clean trout thing in good company 3 on the contrary it will do very well 
my cousin anne chalth her head 
she in not ratiﬁed 
she in futidioru 
my dear cousin sitting down by her a you have a better right to be faatidioue than almost any other woman i know 
but will it answer 
will it make on happy 
will it not be wiser to accept the society of these good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion a in an audible 
you may depend upon persuasion i 53 igthatdteywillmoveintheﬁrstoetin baththis winter and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family our family let me any 
i in that degree of consideration which we must all me for yes a sighed anne 1 we shall indeed be known to be related to them 
a then recollecting herself and not wishing to be answered she added a certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance 
i suppose smiling i have more pride than any of you 
but i confess it does vex me that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them 
pardon me my dear cousin you are unjust to your own claims 
in london perhaps in your present quiet style of living it might be as you say 
but in bath sir walter elliot and his family will always be worth knowing always acceptable as acquaintance 
well a said anne 
i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon placed a i love your indignation 1 said he 
it is so natural 
but here you are in bath and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot 
you talk of being proud 
i am called proud i know end i shall not wish to believe myself otherwise 
for our pride if investigated would have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem a little different 
in one at i am sure my dear cousins he continued speaking lower thou has there was no one else in the room 
in one point ilam sure we must feel alike 
we must feel that every addition to your father society among his equals or superiors may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him l 5 persuasion 
he looked as he spoke to the neat which my clay had been lately accepting a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant 
and though anne could not believe in their having the nine sort of pride the wan pleased with him for not liking an clay 
and her conscience admitted that hit wishing to promote her father getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of detecting her 
chapter 17 
while sir walter and elizabeth were auiduounly pushing their good fortune in laura place anne wan renewing an acquaintance of a very different description 
she had called on her former governess and had heard from her of there being an old ichoolfellow in bath who had the two strong claim on her attention of past kindness and present suffering 
miss hamilton now my smith had shewn her kindness in one of those period 
of her life when it had been most valuable 
anne had gone unhappy to school grieving for the lost of a mother whorri the had dearly loved feeling her separation from home and suffering to a girl of fourteen of strong sensibility and not high spirits must suffer at such a time 
and filial hamilton three your older than herself but still from the want of near relation 
and a rattled home remaining another year at school had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened her misery and could never be remembered with indifierence 
miss hamilton had left school had married not long afterwards was laid to have married a man of fortune and this was all that anne had known of her till now reasmsron 
or 5 5 that their govemess’s account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form 
she was a widow and poor 
her husband had been extravagant 
and at his death about two year 
before had left his affairs dreadfully involved 
she had had difficulties of every sort to contend with and in addition to these distress had been affected with a severe rheumatic fever which finally settling in her legs had made her for the present a couple 
she had come to bath on that account and was now in lounging s near the hot baths living in a very humble way nnah e even to afford herself the comfort of a servant and of course almost excluded from society 
their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from miss elliot would give mrs smith and anne therefore lost no time in going 
she mentioned nothing of what she had he or what she in 
tended at home 
it would excite no hopes interest there 
she only consulted lady russell who entered thorougth into her sentiments and was most ha to convey her as near to mrs smith's lodgings in state uildings as anne chose to be taken 
the visit was paid their acquaintance re-eslnblishcd their interest in each other more than rekindled 
the first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion 
twelve years were gone since they had parted and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had ima ‘ned 
twelve years had changed anne from the blooming silent unforrned girl of fifteen to the else at little woman of seven-andtwenty with every auty excepting bloom and with manners as consciously right as they were invarishly gentle 
and twelve years had transfomlcd the ﬁne-looking well 
grown miss hamilton in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority into a poor inﬁrm helpless widow receiving the visit of her l r 56 pensunsrou 
former protege up a favour but all that won uncomfortable in the meeting had noon passed away 
and left on the interesting charm of remembering former partiahtiet and talking our old times anne found in mrs smith the good sense and agree 
able manner 
which the had almost ventured to d on and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation 
neither the dinipationa of the put 
and the road lived very much in the world 
nor the retraction of the present neither aicltneu nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits 
in the course of a second visit she talked with great openness and anne’s astoniehlnent increaaed 
she could scarcely imagine a more cheerful situation in itself than mrs smith 
she had been ve fond of her husband the had hurried him 
she had no need to silence it wan gone 
she had no child to connect her with life and happiness again no relation to assist in the arrangement of pope lexed affairs no health to make all the rent mpporta le 
her accommodations were limited to a navy parlour and a dark bedroom behind with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance which there we only one tenant in the house to afford and ill 
never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath 
yet in spite of all this anne had reason to believe that the had moments only of languor and depression to court of occupation and enjoyment 
how could it be 
she watched ohaerved rejected and shall determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of recognition only 
a submissive spirits might be silent 
a strong understanding would supply reaolution t here wan something more 
hen wan that elasticity of mind that in son to be comforted that were of turning readin 3 
evil to good and of an age empersuasion 
i s 7 moment which carried her out of herself 
which was mr nature alone 
it was the choicest is of heaven 
and anne viewed her friend me one of those instances in which by a merciful appointment it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want 
there had been a time as smith told her when her spirits had nearly failed 
she could not call herself an invalid now compared with her state on first reaching bath 
then she had indeed been a pitiable object 
for the had caught cold on the journey and had hardly taken possession of her longings before the was again continued to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain 
and all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse and ﬁnanoea at that moment particulatrly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense 
she had weathered it however and could truly say that it had done her good 
it had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands 
she had seen too much of the world to expect ridden or disinterested attachment anywhere but her illness had proved to her that her malady had a character to preserve and would not use her ill 
and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse up a sister of her landlord a nurse by profession and who had always a home in that house when unemployed chanced to be at liberty in time to attend her 
and she a said mrs smith besides nursing me most admirably hat really loved an invaluable acquaintance 
as soon as i ca d use my hands she taught me to suit which has been a great amusement 
and she put me in the way of making these little threadcasel pin-cushions and card-racks which you always and me so by about and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor family in thin neighbourhood 
she has a large acquaintance of course profesaionally among those who or 58 
manor 
can afford to buy and be disposed of m merchandizc 
she always take the right time for ap ying 
everybody heart it open you know when they have recently escaped from severe pain or are recovering the blessing of health and nurse rooke thoroughly understands when to speak 
she in a shrewd intelligent sensible woman 
here ii a line for acting human nature 
and ah ha 
a fond of good sense and observation which at a companion make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received them but education in the world l know nothing worth attending to 
call it gone if you will but when nune rooke hill half an hour leisure to bestow on me the it lustre to have something to relate that ll entertaining and probable something that makes one know one a better 
one like to hear what it going on to augment at to the newest modeof being trifling and silly 
to me who live to much alone her conviction i mute you is a train anne far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure replied i am easily believe it 
women of that clue have great op rtunitiea and if they are intelligent may be well we listening to 
such variety of human nature a they are in the habit of witnessing 
and it is not merely in in followed that they are well read 
for they see it occationally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or acting 
what innancea mutt pass before them of ardent disinterested aelfdenying attachment of heroism fortitude patience reaignation 
of all the collects and all the sacrifices that noble at most 
a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumet.” a year mind my smith more doubtingly sometimes it ma though i fear in lesson are not often in the clean itylc you describe 
here and there human nature may be great in time 
of trial 
but generally msvasrotr 
or 15 speakrn g it is it 
weakness and not its men that appears in a sick chsrnher it is selﬁshness 53d in silence rather than generosity and fortitude that one ears offl‘onuthere is so little real friendship in th‘e’lworild 
and an nately a skin low an mm on there are so man w forget to think seriously tallest is almost too late anne saw the misery of such feelings 
the husband had not been what he ought and the wife had been led among that it of mankind which made her think worse 
of the world than she hoped it deserved 
it was but 1 ‘ng emotion however with mrs smith 
she shook it off and soon added in i different tone i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs toshe is in at present will furnish much either to interest or me 
she is only nursing mrs wallis of marlborough buildings 
a mere pretty silly expensive fashionable woman i believe 
and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery 
i mean to make my proof of mrs wallis however 
she has plenty of man and i intend she shall buy all the high-arched things have in hand now anne had called several dates on her friend before the existence of such a person was known in camden place 
at last it became necessary to speak of her 
sir walter elizabeth and mrs gladly returned one morning from laura place with a sudden invitation from lady dairym less for the same evening and anne was already engaged to spend that evening in wettgate buildings 
she was not sorry for the excuse 
they were only asked the was sure because lady dalrymple being kept at home by a bad cold was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her 
and she declined on her own account with great alacrity 
she was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow

she goes into the warm bath to-morrow 
and for the reproof the week you know we ere engaged 
but what does lady rumll think of thin acquaintance i a asked elizabeth 
a she see nothing to blame in it replied anne 
on the contrary the a prove

merely who had been present while all thin panned now thought it advisable to leave the room and anne could have said much and did long to lay a little in defence of bar friends not very diuimrlar claim to theirs but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her 
she made no reply 
she left it to himself to recollect that my smith was not the only widow in bath between thirty and forty with little to live on and no name of dignity 
anne kept her appointment the others kept there and of course the heard the next morning that that had a delightful evening 
she had been the only one of the let abaent for sir walter and elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship nervice themselves but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others and had been at the trouble of inviting both lady russell and mr elliot 
and mr elliot ha made a point of leaving colonel wnlliearly and lady russell had freah arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her 
anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could reply from lady rune“ 
to her it greater interest must be in having been very much talked of between her friend and mr elliot 
in having been wished for regretted and at the same time honoured for moving away in such i came 
her kind compassionate visit to thin old ochoolfellow pick and reduced turned to have quite delighted mr elliot 
he thought her a most extraordinary young woman in her ten manners mind a model of female excellence

my dearest anne it would give me more deli hot than as often felt at my time of life one was-obliged to turn away to rise to walk to s 
distant table and leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue the feelings this picture excited 
for a few moments her imagination an her heart were bewitched 
the idea of becoming what her mother had been 
of having the precious name of a lady elliot ﬁrst revived in herself 
of being restored to kellynch calling it her home again her home for ever was a charm which she could not immediately resist 
lady russell said not another word willing to leave the matter to its own operation 
and believing that could mr elliot at that moment with propriety have s listen for himself l 
she believed in short what anne d not believe 
the same image of mr elliot speak in for himself brought anne to composure a 
the charm of kellynch and of a lady elliot’s all faded away 
she never could accent him 
and it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one 
her judgment on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against mr elliot 
though they had now been an minute a month she could not be satisfied that she read y knew his character 
that he was i sensible man an agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle this was all clear enough 
he certainly knew what was right nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct

how could it ever he aacemined that his mind will truly cleaniedi mr elliot wal rational diecreet polished but he want not open 
there was never any hum of feeling an warmth of indignation or delight at the evil or good of others 
this to anne was a decided imperfection 
her early impreuione were incurable 
she seized the frank the shared the eager ehiracter beyond all other 
truth and enthuaiaam did captivate her still 
she felt that the could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who tometimea looked or aid a careless

she once that henrietta was at home again 
and that in though considered to be recovering fat was still at some

mr and mr mangrove have not had one dinner-party all the holidays 
i do not reckon the hymen s anybody 
the holidays however are over at last i believe no children ever had such long when 
inneurelhadnot 
the home was cleared yesterday except of the little harville but you will be surprised to bear that they have never gone home 
my harville must be an odd mother to part with them is long 
i do not understand it 
they are not at all nice children in my opinion 
but my mangrove seems to like them wise or well if not better than her grandchildren 
hat dreadful weather we have had 
it may not be felt in bath with your nice pavemenn 
but in the country it it of come comequence 
i have not had a creature call on me time the second week in january except charles walter who he 
been calling much oftener than war welcome 
between ourselves i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at hymen s long an louisa 
it would have kept her a little out of his way 
the carriage in gone to-day to bring louisa and the harville to-rnorrow 
we are not used to dine with them however till the day after mr mangrove in no afraid of her being fatigued by the journey 
which ll not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her 
and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow 
i am glad you and mr elliot so agreeable and with i could be acquainted with him too 
but i have my usual luck i am always out of the way when anything deeirablell persuasion

but perhaps she were to leave the room vacant we might not be invited 
let me know what you think of this 
i do not expect my children to he asked you know 
i can leave them at the great house very well for in month or six weeks 
i have this moment heard that the croft are going to bath almost immediately they think the admiral gouty 
charles heard it quite by chance they have not had the civility to give me any notice or of her to take anything 
i do not think they in me at all as neighbours 
we see nothing of them and thin is really an instance of gross inattention 
charles join me in love and everything proper

so ended the list part which had been sl'terwnrds put into an envelop containing nearly on much more a i kept my letter open that i might lend you word how louisa bore her journey and now i am extremely glad i did having a great deal to add 
in the list place i had a note from mrs croft yesterday offering to convey anything to you 
a very kind friendly note indeed addressed to me just up it ought 
i shall therefore be able to make my letter as long an i like

hope he will be more agreeable now 
certainly not i great match for louisa mangrove but a million times better than marrying among the hayrerl.” mary need not have feared her liberal being in my degree prepared for die new 
she had never in her life been more moral-bed captain benwick and mmunsron 
xii louisa mangrove 
it woe almost too wonderful for belief and it was with the greatest comfort that the could remain in the room preserve anguish of calmness and newer the common question of the moment 
ha ily for her they were not many 
sir walter want to know whether the croft travelled with four horses and whether they were birth to be situated in such a plan of bath at it might suit in elliot and himself to visit in 
but had little curiosity beyond 
a how in mary 
a said elizabeth 
and without waiting for in answer and pray what brings the croft to both i 
they come on the admiral account 
he ll thought to be gouty 
gout and decrepitude 
aid sir walter 
a poor old gentleman 
a have they any acquaintance here 
a asked elizabeth 
a i do not know 
but i can hardly suppose that at admin 
croft'l time of life and in his profusion he should not have many acquaintance in such i place as this 
i su act a aid sir walter coolly 1 that admiral croft will be bent known in bath up the renter of kellynch hall 
elizabeth may we venture to present him and his 
wife in laura place 
a 1 oh no 
i think not 
situated us we are with lady dalrymple cmuina we ought to be very careful not to emma her with ucquamunce the miss ht not approve 
if we were not related it would not signify 
but us acquire the would feel ecrupuloue an to any proposal of ours 
we had better leave the croft to and their own level 
there are several odd-looking men walking about here who i am told are sailorl 
the croft will associate with them 
thin wan sir walter and elizabeth share of i 1 s persuasion 
interest in the letter 
when mr clay had her tribute of mrs decent attention in an enquiry after mrcharlel mangrove and her one little boys anne war it liberty 
in her own room the tried to come reached it 
well miss ht charles wonder how captain worth would feel i perhaps he had quieted the cold had louisa up had sealed to love had found he did not love her 
she could not endure the idea of treachery or levity or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend 
she could not endure that such a friendship on their should be severe unfairly 
captain benwick and louisa mangrove 
the high-epirited joyoue-tallting louisa mangrove and the rejected thinking feeling reading captain benwick 
seemed each of then everything that would not suit the other 
their minds most diuimilar 
where could have been the attraction 
the answer noon praented itself 
it had been in situation 
they had been thrown together neveral week 
they had been living in the lame unall family party iince henrietta’n coming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each other and leaning just recovering from illness had been in an interesting lute 
and captain'benwick wan not ineonuolnble 
that was a point which anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before 
and inn of drawing the same conclusion as mary from the resent course of events they arrived only to concern the idea of his having felt some drawings of tenderness toward herself 
she did not mean however to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity than mary might have allowed 
she was persuaded that any tolerable genuing young woman who had listened and ieemed to feel for him would have received the lame compliment 
he had an affectionate heart he must love wmebody 
persuasion 
i 7 i she as no reason against their being by 
louisa hadline naval fervour to begin with an they would soon grow more alike 
he would gain cheerfirlneae and the would learn to he an enthuaiut for scott and lord byron 
nay that wan rohably learnt already 
of course they had fallen in move over poetry 
the idea of louisa mangrove turned into a pen of literary taste and sentiment rejection war amuaing 
but the had no doubt of in being no 
the day at some the fall from the lobby might influence her health her newer her courage her character to the end of her life thoroughly an it appeared to have induced her fate 
the conclusion of the whole wan that if the woman who had been sensible of captain wentworth’e merits could be allowed to prefer another road there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder 
and if captain wentworth lost no friend his certainly nothing to he regretted 
no it was not regret which made anne’s heart beat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheeks when the thought of captain wentworth unuhaclded and free 
she had some feeling 
which she was ashamed to inventigate 
they were too much like joy aenaeleu joy 
she longed to lee the croft 
but when the meeting took place it was evident that no rumour of the new had yet reached them 
the visit of ceremony wan paid and returned 
and louisa mangrove war mentioned 
and captain benwick too without even half a mile 
the croft had placed themselves in lodgings in gay streetlperfeetly to sir walter’s satisfaction 
he wan not at l ashamed of the acquaintance and did in fact think and talk a great deal more about the admiral than the admiral ever thought or talked about him 
the croft 
knew quite ii many people in bath at m 
r1 persuasion 
they wished for 
and considered their intercourse with the elliott at a mere matter of form and not in the last likely to afford them any pleasure 
they brought with them their common habit of being always together 
he murdered to w to keep off the gout in my croft seemed to go that with him in everything and to walk for her life to do him good 
anne aw them wherever the went 
lady russell took her out in her carriage nlrnott every morning 
and the never failed to think of them and never failed to teethent 
knowing their feelings up the did it was a meet attractive picture of happiness to her 
she always watched them a long it the could 
delighted to fancy the understood what they might be talking of at they walked along in ht dependence or equallzadelrghred to see the edymirtl’t hearty shake of the and when he encountered an old friend and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into i little know of the navy mn croft looking an intelligent and keen at any of the piece around her 
anne was too much engaged with lady russell to he often walking herself 
but it to hop ed that one morning about a week or ten day a m the profits arrival it united her best to leave her friend or her friends carriage in the lower part of the town in return tone to camden place end in walking up milsom street the had the good fortune to meet with the admiral

at won as they were fairly ascending belmont he began 
— a well now you shall hear something that will price you 
but list of all you must tell me the name of the young lady i am going to tall about 
that young lady you know that we have all been to concerned for 
the miss mil-grove that all thin ha been happening to 
her christian name i always forget her christian name anne had been ashamed to appear to come round to loan ii the really did 
but now the could a sly suggest the name of a louisa 
nay ay mialouiu mangrove that it the name 
which 
i i rich young ladies had not much i number of line chriat'un names 
i should never be out if they were all soothe or something of that sort 
well this in louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederick 
he war courting her week after week 
the only wonder on what they could be waiting for till thebusineaaat lymecame 
then indeed it was clear enough that they must wait 
till her brain wisest to right 
but even then there war iornething odd in their way of going on 
instead of staying at some he went off to plymouth and then he went off to see edward 
when we came back from minehead he was gone down to edward and there he has been ever since 
we have seen nothing of him since november

but james benwick in terms piano for me 
and though very likely it in all our partiality spy and i can not help thinking frederick s manner better than his 
there in something about frederick more to our rued anne wascaught.‘ she had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentlemen being incompatible with each other not at all to represent captain benwick’t manner a the very best that could pony he 
and after a little hesitation the veil beginning to us a i wan not entering into any comparison of the two friend 
a but the admiral interrupted her with 
and the thing it certainly true 
it in not a mere bitof gouip 
we have it from frederick himself 
hit litter had a letter from him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it in a letter from harville written upon the spot from uppercrou 
i flue they are ill at uppercrou 
ilhit wan an opportunity which anne could not resist 
the mind therefore i hope admiral i there it nothing in the it less of captain wentworth’t letter to make you and me croft particularly unealy 
it did certainly them last autumn if there were an attachment between him and louisa mutgmve 
but i hope it may he understood to have worn out on each tide equally and without violence 
i hope hll letter does 
not breathe the spirit of an ill-sized man 
not at all not at all there in not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end anne looked down to hide her smile 
no no 
frederick is not a man to shine and complain 
he hat too much spirits for that 
if the girl numsrox 
x71 ﬁ’wr nun ham it in very it up ihould have a certainly 
but what i mean in that i hope there in nothing in wentworth’l manner of writing to make you suppose he think himself allowed by his friend which might appear us know without it being absolutely lid 
i ihould very carry the inch a friendship ii he 
insisted between him and caring benwick ihould be destroyed or even wounded x a clrcnmnance of thin sort 
yes east i understand you 
but there ll nothing at all of nature in the letter 
he does not give the lent ring at benwick 
does in much lay 1 i wonder at it 
i have a mean of my own for wondering at it no you would not guns from his way of writing that he had ever thought of this in what 3 her name 
for himself 
he very handsomely hopes they will be happy together 
and there ll nothing very un given in that i think anne had not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant to convey but it would have been useless to pity the enquiry farther 
she therefore satisfied her with common-place remark or quiet attention and the admiral had it all hit own way 
poor frederick laid he at an 
now he must begin all over a air with somebody else 
i think we must get him to the 
sorry must write and beg him to come to bath 
here are pretty girls enough ammre 
itwouldheafnouaeto otou rose again for that other in mangrove and mob by her cousin the young patron 
do not on think miss elliot we had better try to get him on it i 78 nasunsron 
charm 18 
while admiral croft was taking his wall with anne and expressing hit with of getting ca n wentworth to bath captain wentworth was ready on hit way thither 
before mrs croft had written he war arrived and the very next time anne walked out 
the law him 
mr elliot war attending hit two cousins and mr clay 
they were in milton street 
it began to rain not much but enough to maple thelter desirable for women and quite enough to make it very desirable for miss elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in lady dalrymple’e carriage which war been waiting at a little distance the anne and mr clay therefore turned into molland't while mr elliot to lady dahymplc w request her ordnance 
soon joined them again nieces-fill of course 
lady dalrymple would be most happy take them home and would call for them in a few minute 
her ladyship carriage was a barouche and did not hold more tinn four with any comfort 
miss carteret wet with her mother 
consequently it war not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three camden place ladiet 
there could be no doubt at to miss elliot 
whoever suffered inconvenience the most wife none but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two 
the rain eri a mere trifle and anne was most iince in preferring a walk with mr elliot 
but the rain was also a mere trifle to my clay 
the would hardly allow it even to drop at all and her books were so thick 
much quicker than miss anne’s 
and in about her civility rendered her quite at anxious to be left to walk with mr elliot u anne could he and it was discussed between them unsunsron 
a 45 with a generosity so polite and so determined that the others were obliged to settle it for them 
miss elliot maintaining that mrs clay had a little cold already and mr elliot deciding on a that hit coulin news books were rather the topic it was fixed accordingly that mrs clay 
should he of the party in the carriage 
and they had just reached this not when anne as she eat near the window descried most decidedly and distinctly captain wentworth walking down the street 
her start was perceptible only to herself 
but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world the most unaccountable and absurd 
for a few minute 
she saw nothing before her it was all confusion 
she was lost and when the had scolded back her sense she found the others still waiting for the carriage and mr elliot always ohligingg 
just setting off for union sheet on a commission of mrs cla s 
she now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door 
she wanted to see if it rained 
why was the to suspect herself of another motive 
captain wentworth must be out of sight 
she left her seat she would go 
one half of her should not he always to much wiser than the other half or always msgecn‘ng the other of being worse than it was 
she wool see if it rained 
she was sent back however in a moment by the entrance of captain wentworth himself among s party of gentlemen and ladies evidently his acquaintance and whom he must have joined a little below milsom street 
he was more seriously struck and confused by the right of her than she had ever observed before 
he looked quite red 
for the first time since their renewed acquaintance she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two 
she had the advantage of him in preparation of the last few moments 
all 18 persuasion 
the overpowering blinding bewilderin one effect of many surprises were over with her 
till however she had enough to fell it vm agitation pin plelnlre 
a something between delight and ninety 
he spoke to her end then turned ewe 
the character of hit manner wan ernhnmument 
he could not love called it either cold or friendly or anything no certainly an unlimited 
after i ihort interval however he came toward her and spoke again 
usual inquiries on common inhneitherofthemmmhnhly much thewieer for w t they heard and anne continuing fully smile of his being sea at one than formerly 
they had dint 
of being in very much together got to speak to eat other with a considerable man ofawanntindiﬁ'erenoe and calmness 
but he so d not do it now 
time had changed him or long had changed him 
there wan conlcinulnen of some sort or other 
he looked very well not an if he had been suffering in health or supine and he talked of uppercrou of the mulgrovee nay even of louisa and had even a momentary look of his own arch iigniﬁcanee no he named her 
but 
yet it was ca iain wentworth not comfortable not easy not able to design that he was 
it did not praise but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth would not know him 
she evil that he law elizabeth that elizabeth law him that there wan com iete internal recognition on each ride 3 the we 
cum/laced that he wan ready to be acknowledged an an acquaintance expecting it and she had the pain of rage her deter turn away with umlremhle coldnen 
lady dalrymple carriage her which in elliot wan growing very impatient now drew up 
the servant came in to announce it 
1 war beginning to rain again and after together there wan i deal and a hide de talking 
which must make all the lit e crowd in the shop undennnd that lady dalrymple was calling to convey miu elliot 
persuasion 
m atlath elliotand her friendmauended but by the tenant for there want wuain returned were walking i 
and wentworth watching them turned again to anne and by manner rather than word was offering hll service to her 
i am much obliged to you a wan her answer but i am not going with them 
the carriage would not accord tea to many 
i walk i prefer walking 
but it rains 
oh 
very little 
nothing that i m 
after a moment's pause he said a thought i came only yesterday i have equipped myaelf properly for bath already you see pointing to a new umbrella 
a i wiahyon would make of it you are determined to walk 
though i think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair 
a she was very much obliged to him but declined it all repeating hercom'iction that the rain would come to nothing at present and adding a i am only waiting for mr elliot 
he will be here in a moment i am sure 
she had hardly spoke the word 
when mr elliot walked in 
captain wentworth recollected him perfectly 
there was no difference between him and the man hadatood on the sea at lymadmirin anne at she passed six t in the air and look an manner of the privileged action and friend 
he came in with eagerness appeared to lace and think only her apologised for him any war grieved to have k t her waiting and anxious to get her away without rather inn of time and before the rain increued 
and in another moment they walked of to other her arm under his a gentle and emma glance and a 1 goodmarning to you 
being all that the had time for us the passed away 
a not at they were out of night the ladies of captain wentworth party began talking of them 
28th amnion 
a mr elliot done not like his cousin i fancy

he in alwaywith them 
half lives in the male i believe 
what a very good-looking man i a a year and in atkinaon who dined with him once at the wallis say he ll the most agreeable man die ever war in company with

anne elliot 
very pretty when one corner to look at her 
it in not the fashion to any no but confess admire her more than her alter 
a oh 
it do in a and no do i 
no comparison 
but the men are all wild after miss elliot 
anne in too delicate for them 
anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin if he would have walked by her ride all the way to camden place without saying a word 
she had never found it no difficult to to him though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care and though his subjects were principally arch in were wont to he always interesting praiee warm june and incriminating of lad russell and insinuations highly rational again on c ay 
but just now she could think only of captain wentworth 
she could not under his present feelings whether he were really uttering mud from disappointment or not 
and till that point were rattled the could not be quite herself 
she hoped be wise and enable in time 
but alas alas the most confer to herself that the war not wise yet another circumstances very essential for her know was how long he meant to be in bath 
he had not mentioned it or the could not recollect it 
he might be only passing through 
but it was more pronrsuasion 
183 hablethathcahouldbecomewny 
that one a table every body wan to meet every body in bath lady rune 
would in all likelihood lee him somewhere 
a would she recollect him 
how would it all be 
she had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa mangrove was to many captain benwick 
it had cost her something to encounter lady ruuell’a aurprile 
and now if she were by any chance to be thrown into come by with captain wentworth her imperfect knowl gaze of the matter might 
add another shade of prejudice against him 
the allowing morning anne was out with her friend and for the hint hour in an inoeaaant and fearful can of watch in him in vain 
but at last in returning down pulteney street the distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such advances up to leave him in view the greater part of the meet 
there were many other men about him many groupe walking the same way but 
there was no making him 
she looked iniﬁnctively at lady rune“ but not from any mad idea of her reconciling him no noon at the did here 
no it was not to be supposed that 
lady russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite 
she looked at her however from how to time anxioual 
and when the moment approach which moot point him out though not daring to look again for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen the wan yet perfectly conscious of lady runaell'l eyel being turned exactly in the direction for him 
of her being in short intently obaerving him 
she could thoroughly comprehend the cart of fascination he most power over lady ruuell’u mind the difficulty it most be for her to withdraw her eyes the astonishment she must be feeling that 
eight or nine year should have passed over him and in foreign crime and in active service boot without robbing him of one person grace

his two daughters and mr clay were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening 
and a lady dalrymple mind he waited for the took their nation by one of the lines in the octagon oorn 
but hardly were they no settled when the door opened again and captain wentworth walked in alone 
anne wan the nearest to him and making yet a little advance the injury lpoke

a sudden recollection ieemed to occur and to give him name but of that emotion which war reddening anne'r cheek and fixing her eye

after clearing hie throat however he led thno

i regard louisa drove up a very amiable tweet-tempted girl and not deficient in understanding but benwick it nothing more

and i confess that i do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise 
had it been the effect of gratitude had he learnt to love her because he believed her to he preferring him it would have been another thing 
but i have no reason to uwooe it no 
it been on the contrary to have been 5 perfectly spontaneous untaught feeling on his tide and thin surprise me 
a man like him in his situation with i heart pierced wounded almort broken 1 fanny harville war i very superior creature and his attachment to her was indeed fact a man does not recover from such a devotion of the hear to such a woman 
he ought not 
he does not 
either from the conuciournevl however that his friend had recovered or from some other conlcioumeu he went no farther

but when pain in over the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure 
one does not love i place the less for having suffered in it 
unless it been all ouﬁ‘ering nothing but suffering which war by no man

up as the mud 
the entrance door opened again and the very stay a d for whom they were waiting 
a lady edrymp e lady dalryrnplel 
war the rejoicing aound 
and with all the engcrneal compatible with anxiouelegance sir walter and hit two ladies stepped forward to meet her 
lady dalrymple end mm camera escorted by mr elliot and colonel wdlia whn'had happened to arrive nearly at the lame inetant advanced into the room 
the others joined them and it we a great in which anne found 
if able necessarily included 
she was divided from captain wentworth 
their intending almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time but alight war the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on 
she had learnt in the into ten minutes more of his feelings towards louisa more of all his feelings than she dared to think of 
and all 
gave henelfup to the demands of the party to the needful civility of the moment with exquisite though agitated neneationa 
she me in good humour with all 
she had received ideas which dispose her to be courteous kind to all and to pity every one a being lean ha y than herself 
e deli htf'ul emotions were a little subdued when on stepped back from the group to be joined again by capmn unworthy the us that he was gone 
she was just in time to lace him turn into the concert room 
he wan gone 
he had appeared she felt a moment’but 
they should meet again 
he would look for her he would and her out long before the evening were over and at preteocté‘ferhape it war at well to he launder 
she wet in a of a little interval for recollection 
upon lady ruuell’e appearance noon afterwards the xgo persuasion 
wholepartywu collected and all that remained rug to maria themselves and proceed into the concert room 
and be full the consequence in their power draw an my eyes excite a many while and did 
turn in many people at they could 
very very ha py were both elizabeth and anne elliot 2 they in 
elizabeth arm-in-arm with miss margaret and looking on the broad hack of the dowager viacounteu dalrymple before her had nothing to with for which did not seem within her reach 
and anne 
but it would be an insult to the nature oonne’i felicity to draw any comparison between it and her we 
the origin of one all selfish vanity of the other all eneroua attachment 
one new nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room 
her ha ineal walk from within 
her eye were his hat an her cheek 
glowed 
but she knew nothing a t it 
she was thinking only of the last half hour and at they passed to their acute her mind took i hazy range over it 
his choice of subject hll expreuiont and'atill more hit manner and look had been inch an the could see in only one light 
hit opinion of louin'mutgrove’t inferiority an opinion which he had seemed rolicitoru to give his wonder at captain benwick his feelings as to a hint strong attachment 
tentencel begun which he could not punish his half-averted eyes and more than half-exprellive glance all all declared that he had a heart returning to her at learnt 
that anger resentment avoidance 
were no more 
and that they were proceeded not merely by friendship and regard but by the tenderness of the pair 
a time aware of the tendency of the part far she could not contemplate the change an implying lcu 
he must love her 
these were thoughts with their attendant viaionl which occupied and hurried her too much to leave heirnnsunsxon 
15 any power of observation 
and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him without even a trying to discern him 
hen their plucwere determined on and they were all roperly arranged she looked round to see if he should happen to he in the name part of the room but he was not 
her eye could not reach him 
and the concert being just opening the must content for a time to be happy in an humble way 
the yet war divided and disposed of on we contiguoua chu anne was among those on the report and mr elliot had maneuvmd an well with the chance of hit friend colonel wallis an to have a neat by her 
miss elliot surrounded has her cousins and the principal object of colonel w lia’e gallantry was quite contented 
anne mind we in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening 
it war just occupation enough the had feeling for the tender spirits for the gay attention for the scientiﬁc and patience for the wearioome 
and had never liked a concert better at least during the list act 
towards close of it in the interval aucceeding an italian songs she explained the world the song to mr elliot 
they had a comfort bill between them 
this a laid the 2 in nearly the sense or rather the running of the worth for certainly the sense of an italian love-song must not he talked of but it it no nearly the means an i can give 
for i do not pretend to understand theiangunge 
i am a very poor italian acholar 
yet yes i see you are 
i ace you know nothing of the matter 
you have only knowledge enough of the language to trace at night these inverted turtlcunailed italian liner into clear comprehendble elegant engliah 
you need not yet anything more of your ignorance 
here is complete proof 
42 persuasion 
a i will not of such kind politeness 
but i should be sorry to examined by a real proﬁcient 
i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place long a replied he a without knowing something of miss anne elliot 
and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware 1 of half her accomplishment and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman a for shame 
for shame thin to too much of flattery 
i forget what we are to have next turning to the bill 
perhaps said mr elliot 
speaking low i have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of a indeed how so 
you can have been acquainted with it only since i came to bath excepting an u might he 
me previoust spoken of in my own fa y 
i knew you by report long before you came to bath 
i had heard you described by those who knew you intimately 
i have been acquainted with you by character many years 
your person your disposition accomplishment manner 
they were all described they were all present to me 
mr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise 
no one can withstand the charm of such a mystery 
to have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance by nameless plead in irresistible 
and anne wan all curiocity 
her wondered and questioned him eagerly 
but in vain 
he delighted in being asked but he would not tell 
a no no some time or other perhaps but not now 
he would mention no names now 
but such he could assure her had been the fact 
he had many years ago received inch 1 description of miss anne elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excited the warmest curiosity to know her 
nesrmsron 
48 anne could think of no one so likely to have key with partiality of her many year a no as the mr unworthy of hunsford captain entworth’s brother 
he might have been in mr elliot s company but he had not courage to all the union 
6 the name of anne elliot aid he has long had an interesting sound to me 
very long has it painted a charm over my fancy 
and if i dared i would breathe my wishes that the name might never change such she believed were his words 
but scarcely had she received their sounds than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her which rendered everything else trivial 
her father and lady dalrymple were speaking 
a well-looking man a said sir walter a very well 
looking man a v one man indeed 
a laid lad dalryrnplzl.’y

no i just know his name

his sister married m tenant in samenetahire the camp t who renta tell such 
a before sir alter had reached this point anne’s 
eye had caught the right direction and distinguished aptain wentworth sanding among a cluster of men at a little distance 
a her eyes fell on him his asserted to be withdrawn from her 
it had that appearance 
it seemed as if she had been one moment too late 
and as long as she dared observe he did not look again but the performance wan recommeneing and the vicar forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward 
when she could give another glance he had moved away 
he could not have come nearer to her if he 15 msutsxon 
would 
d ewnnomn’oundedmdehutin but the would rather have caught his eye 
mr elliot’s ipeech too doomed her 
she had no longer any inclination to talk to him 
she wished him not no sure her 
the first act ran over 
now the hoped for wine beneﬁcial change 
and after 3 period of nothing-laying amongst the party come of them did decide on going in quest often 
anne win one of the few who did not chooeetomove 
sheremainedinher ugandnodid lady russell 
but he had the penury of getting rid of mr elliot 
and the did not mean whatever the might feel on lad ruuell’l account to shrink from conversation with captain wentworth if he red her the opportunity 
she was persuaded by lady unell’t countenance that she had seen him 
he did not come however 
anne sometimes fancied the deemed him at a distance but he never came the anxious intend wore away unproductively 
the others returned the room called again hencheu were declared and repoueued and another hour of pleasure or of penance wan to he eat out another hour of music was to give delight or the paper an real or nﬁ‘ected rate for it required 
to anne it chiefly wore the prospect of an ray of agitation 
she could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth once more without the interchange of one friendly look 
in regretting themselves there were now many changed the result of which was favourable for her 
colonel wallis declined sitting down a no and mr elliot woe invited by elizabeth and in secret in a manner not to be refuted to lit between them 
and by name other removal and a little scheming of her own anne was enabled to place herself much more the end of the bench than the had been before much more within reach of a passer-by 
she could not do so without pusrmsron 
45 comparing herself with miss caroline the inimitable miss caroline

miss carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what we next to be long

their union she believed could not divide her more from other men than their final separation 
prettier running of high-wrought love and eternal constancy could never have passed along the streets of bath than anne was sporting with from camden place to penetrate buildings it we almost enough to spread privation and persuade all the way 
she wan sure of a pleasant reception 
and her friend seemed this moment particularly obliged to her for coming ieemed ay to have expected her though it had been an appointment 
an account of the concert was immediately claimed 
and anne’s recollections of the concert were quite ha py enough he to animate her features and make her rejoice to a key of it 
all that she could tell she told most gladly but the all we little for one who had been there and uneadefactory for each an enquiry an mn smith who had already heard through the short cut of a hundred and a waiter rather more of the general uncles and produce of the evening than anne could relate and who now walked in vain for several particular

i have been a good deal acquainted with him replied mn smith gravely 1 but it over worn out now 
it in a great while since we met 1 i wan not at all aware of thin 
you never mentioned it before 
had i known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you 
to confess the truth aid mn smith assuring her um 
air of cheerfulness thing in exactly the pleasure i want you to have 
i want you to talk about me to mr elliot 
i want your interest with him 
he can be of essential service to me

a now how i do wish i understood on 
how i do with i knew what s were all have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel when the right moment cornea 
till it does come you know we women never mean to have anybody 
it is a thing of course among us that every man in refusing till he offered 
but why ihould you he cnlel.’ let me plead for my 
pruent friend i can not call him but for my former friends 
where can you look for a more suitable match 
where could you expect a more gentlepersuasion 
30 i like agreeable nun 
let me recommend mr elliot 
i am sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel wallis 
and who can know him better than colonel wallis 
my dear my smith mr elliot’s wife has not been dead much above half a ear 
he ought not to be so proposed to be paying his addresses to on one 
half if these are your only objection cried mr 
smith archly 1 mr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him 
do not forget me when you are married that s all 
let him know me to be a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required which it is very natural for him now with many affair and engagements of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can 
very natural perhaps 
ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same 
of course he must be aware of the importance to me 
well my dear miss elliot i hope and trust you will be very happy 
mr elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman 
your peace will not be uhinvreckcd as mine has been 
you are safe in all wo dly matters and safe in his character 
he will not be led stray 
he will not be misled by others to his rained a 
no a rapid anne 1 i can readily believe all that of my cousin 
he seems have a calm decided temper not at all open to dangerous impressions 
i consider him with great relpect 
i have no reason from anything that ha 
fallen within my observation to do otherwise 
but i have not known him long 3 and he is not i man s i think to be known intimate soon 
will not this manner of speaking of him nlrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me 
surely this must be calm enough 
and upon my word he is nothing to me 
should he ever propose to me which i have we little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing

as it was she warmly lubmitmd 
and with i the petulance of ieeing nothing beyond 
and anne eager to escape farther notice wan impatient to know why mr smith should have fancied the was to marry r elliot 
where the could have received the idea or from whom she could have hard it 
do tell how it came into our head 
a 1 it lint came into my had a rap led on smith 
upon finding how much were together and feeling it to be the most pmbabremthing in the world to he wished for by everybody belonging to either of you 
and you may defend upon it that all your acquaintance lave disposed of you in the me way

and anne felt that the blind nothing but an increase of curiosity 
they were both silent if smith very thoughtful 
at 1m 
a i beg your pardon m dear mine elliot she cried in her natural tone of so reality a i beg your pardon for the short answer 
i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do 
i have been doubting and wondering i to what i ought to tell you

there were many things be taken into the account

i think you ought to be rude a uainted with mr elliot’s tell character 
though fully believe that at pmmyyou lure notthe smallest intention of accepting him there in no saying v what may hit 
you might lame time or other be diﬁ'crently n ected towards him 
hear the truth therefore now while you are prejudiced 
mr elliot in a man without hurt or contrivance 
its origin wiry cold-blooded being 
who think 
only of htmaell‘ 
who for his own interest or use would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery that could he perpetrated without risk of his 
general character 
he ha no feeling for others 
those whom he has been the chief chance of leading into ruin 
he ran neglect and desert without the smallest compunciion

you must allow for an injured angry woman 
but i will to command mytelf 
i will not amuse him 
i will only tell you what i have found him 
futihall lpenk 
he won the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him in thought him at good ii himnelf 
the intimacy had been formed before our marriage 
i mud t em most intimate friends 
and i too became executiver pleased with mr elliot and entertained the highest opinion of him 
at nineteen on know one the 
not think ve teriounly 
but mr elliott s to those quite ii at others 
and much more agreeable a l persuasion 
205 than mot others 
and we were almost always either 
we were principally in town 
living in very style 
he war then the inferior in drcummacea 
he war then the poor one 
he had chamber in the temple and it was a match 
he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman 
he had always a home with us whenever he chose it 
he was always welcome 
he war like a brother 
my poor charles who had the rest moot l spirit in the world would have divided hid but farthing with him 
i know that his pnnewalopento him 
i know that he often united him a thin must have been about that very body of mr elliot life laid anne which has ways excited my particular curioeity 
it must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and time 
i never knew him myself i only heard of him 
but there war a something in hill conduct then with regard to my father and deter and afterwards in the circumeuncel of ill mania e which i never could quite reconcile with present mr 
it ieemed to announce a different sort of man 
i know it all i know it all a cried mr smith 
a he had been introduced to sir walter and your deter before i was acquainted with him but i heard him speak of them for ever 
1 know he war invited and encouraged and i know he did not choose to go 
i can satisfy you rhapl on points which you would little expect 
an as to hit marriage i knew all about it at the time 
i w privy to all the on and again 
i was the friend to whom he concluded his hopes and plans 
and though i did not know his wife previourly her inferior situation in society indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards or at lent till within the last two years of her life and can lower an question you with to put tray a said anne 1 i have particular enquiry c :06 persuasion 
to make about her 
i have always understood were not i happy couple 
but i should like to know why at tint time of his life he should slight my father's acquaintance as he did 
my father certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him 
why did mr elliot draw back i a mr elliot a man smith 
at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by i rather quicker procethan the law 
he woe determined to make it by marriage 
he we 
determined at lent not to mary it by an imprudent marriage 
and i know it was his belief whether june or not of course i can not decide that your father and consider in their civilities and invitation were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered 
his idea of wealth and indqlcndencc 
that wan his motive for drawing back i can name you 
he told me the whole story 
he had no concealment 
with me 
it was curious that having ust left you behind me in bath my trust and principal acquaintance on carrying should be your cousin 
and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister 
he described one mind elliot and i thought my affectionately of the 
other 
perhaps a cried anne muck b a sudden idea you sometimes spoke of me to mr lliot 
to censure i did 
very often 
i neck to boat of my own anne elliot and vouch for your being a very different creature from 
a she checked herself in time 
his accounts for something which mr elliot taid last night cried anne 
this explains it 
i found he had been used to hear of me 
i could not come rehend how 
what wild in rational one form w ere a dear self is concerned 
how cure to be mistaken 
hang 
i07 butlbeg ourpordon 
i have interrupted you 
mr elliot nunied then completely for money 
the circle probably which first opened your eyes to hicharacteri’ mn smith heitated 3 little here 
oh 
those thing are too common 
when one live in the world a man or woman’l mnn'ying for money ll too common to strike one s it ought 
i wan very young and associate only with the young and we were a thoughtless y net without any strict rule of conduct 
we lived or enjoyment i think differently now 
time andiicknee and sorrow have given me other notions 
but at that i must own raw nothing reprehenlible in what mr elliot was doing 
to do the better himself passed at a duty 
a but was not the a red low woman 
a eyes 
which 1 object to but he would not read 
money matey wan all that he wanted 
her after me a gainer her grandfather hid been a butcher but that was all nothing 
she will a one woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliot company and fell in love with him 
and not a difficult or a couple was there on his ride with respect to her birth 
all his caution was spent in being enquired of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself depend upon it whenever eneem mr elliot may have for hit own situation in life now 
up a young mu he had not the urnalleet value for it 
his chance of the bell nch estate wan something but all the honour of the family he held at cheap 5 dirt 
i have often heard him declare that if baronctciea were useable anybody should have hit for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included 
but i will not pretend to repeat halfthzt lunedto hear him my on that subject 
it would not be fair 
and yet you ought to have proof for nor persuasion 
what it all thin but attention and you shall have indeed my dear my smith i want none cried anne 
you have exerted nothing oonmdicto to what mr elliot appeared to be some year ago 
1.lzhia in all in conversation rather of what we need to hear and believe 
i am more curiosity to know why he ihould be no different now 
but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary 
stay i am sir you will have the mill greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom 
and bringing me the mall inlaid box which you will and on the upper shelf of the closet anne ieeing her friend to be already bent on it did an the wan deoired 
the box we brought and placed before her and mr smith sighing over it up the unlocked it mid 
this in full of paperbelonging to him to my husband 
a wall portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him 
the letter i am looking for wan one written by mr elliot to him before our marriage and happened to be lived 
why one can hardly imagine 
but he was careless and methodical like other men about those things 
and when i came to examine hie pit to i found it with other nil more trivial from i spent ple scattered here and there while many longer an memorandum of real in romance had been delayed 
here it in 
i would not burn it became being even then very little talked with mr elliot i was determined to pretend every moment of former intimacy 
i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it 
thin wan the letter directed to charge smith 
tunbridgc wallis 1 and dated from london at far k at july 1803 
rznsunsron 
45 due 
smith 
i have received your 
your kindness almost overpower me 
i wish nature had made such hearth as you more common but i have lived three-and-twenty years in the world 
and have seen none like it 
at present believe me i have no need of your services 
being in cash again 
give me joy i have got rid of sir walter and more 
they are gone back to kellynch and almost made me wear to visit them thin summer 
but my great visit to kellynch will be with a survey to tell me how to bring it with but advantage to the summer 
the baronet neverthdcaa ll not unlikely to marry again 
he in quite fool enough 
if he does 
however they will leave me in peace which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion 
he in worse than last year 
a i with i had an name but elliot 
i am sick of it 
the name of alter i can drop thank god 
and i desire you will never insulted me with my second w

such a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow 
and mr smith observing the high colour in her face said 
he 
the in e i know in being disrespectful 
though i havgemfgrgot the exact terms have a perfect impression of the general meaning 
but it shows you the man 
mark hra professions to my poor husband 
can anything be longer i 
anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of ending such words applied to her father 
she obliged to recollect that her ieeing the letter war a violation of the laws of honour that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such heatimonies that no risks corre ndence could bear the eye of other be more the cool recover calmness enough no

i have shewn on mr elliot ii he was dozen years ago and i will shew him an he in now 
i can not use written proof again but i an give an nuthenuc oral matrimony as you can desire of what he it now wanting and what he in now doing

mr elliot tallu unneerredly to colonel wallis of his view

but colonel wallis hat a very pretty silly wife to whom he tells thing 
which he had sister not

she in the overpowering train of her recovery repeat it all to her name 
and in none knowing my acquaintance with you very naturally bring all to me 
on monday evening my good friend my looks let me that much into the accretof marlborough bulldlngi 
when i talked of a whole history therefore you ice i war not dancing i much at you wppoaed.’ my dear my smith 
our authority in deﬁcient 
thin will not do mr el its having any views on wuasion 
2 l l me will not in the least account for the effort 
he made towards reconciliation with my little 
hint was all priorto mycorningtoboth 
i foundthemon theme friendly terms when i arrived 1 i know you did 
i know it all perfectly but 
indeed mr smith we must not expect to get real information in inch 3 line 
f ecu or opinion 
which are to through the hands of to many to be received wildly in one and ignorance in another you hardly have much truth le 
only gave me a hearing 
you will noon be able judge of the general credit due by listening to come particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or concern 
nobody supposes that you were his list inducement 
he had seen you indeed before he arm to bath and admired you 
but without knowing it to be you 
so lay my hrmrian at lent 
it thin true 
did he see you lent summer or autumn 1 nomewhere down in the went to use her own words without knowing it to be you in a he certainly did 
so far it ll very true 
at some 
i happened to be at some 
a well a continued mrs smith trium hasty a grant my friend the credit due to the employment of the list point userted 
he as you then at some and liked you so well up to be exceedingly pleased to meet with us again in camden place as him anne elliot and am that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visit there 
but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain 
if there in anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable stop me 
my account am that your lim'l friend the lady now staying with you whom i has heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and i walter so long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and ha 
been 2 l 2 pmasioii 
staying there ever iince 
that ill i a clever inalmllting hand-nine woman 
poor and plaun'hle and altogetberwchinn'tnationlodmanner utogivea general idea among sir walner’a acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a that .1.elliot should he apparently blind to the day 
ere mn smith paused a moment 
hutannehad not a word to say and the continued 
this wan the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it 
and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be mild of it 
though he did not then visit in camden place 
but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that wan going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the m beginning to prevail 
now you are to undergo tint time had worked a very material change in mr elliot’s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy 
upon all point of blood and connexion he in a completely altered man 
having long had an much man at he could spend nothing to with for on the date of avarice or indulgence he hat been gradually coming to pin his happiness upon the consequence he in heir to 
i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it in now a conﬁrmed feeling 
he can not beardxeideaofnotheing sir william 
you may guess therefore 
that the news he heard from his friend could not he very agreeable and you may guess what it produced 
the resolution of coming back to bath an won an possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the persuasion 
2 i 3 degree of his danger end of circumventing the lady if he found it material 
thin was a upon between the two friend 
an the only thing to done 
and colonel wallis wan to united in every way that he could 
he was to be introduced and mr wallis war to be introduced 
and everybody wan to be introduced 
mr elliot came back aceordltgly 
and on application was forgiven us now admitted into the family 
and there it was his constant object in hit only oléjectvyill your arrival added another motive 
to watch is alter and mr clay 
he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way

i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared

my smith had been carried away from her first direction and anne had forgotten in the interest of her own family concern how much had been originally implied against him 
but her attention was now called to the explanation those lines hints 
and ill listened to a recital which if it did not perfectly justify the unqualiﬁed bitterness of my smith proves him to have been very unfeeling in hit conduct towards 
very deficient both in justice and companion 
she learned that the intimacy between them continuing impaired by mr elliot 1 marriage they had been a before always together and mr elliot had led hit friend into expected much beyond his fortune 
my smith did not want to take blame to herself and we moot after of throwing any on her husband 
but anne rmumon 
2 r 5 could collect that their income had never been else to their style of living and that from the list there had been a great deal general and joint extravagance 
from his wife account of him she could discern mr smith to have been a man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong understanding 
much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him led by him and probably despised him 
mr elliot 
raised his marriage to great uncle and to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without 
involving himself for with his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man and beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend probableﬁnances but on the contrary had been promoting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the smiths accordingl had been misled 
the husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it 
hey had previously known embarrassment enough to try the friendship of their friends and to prove that mr elliot s had better not be tried 
but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known 
with a confidence in mr elliot’s regard more creditable to his feelings than his judgment mr smith had appointed him the executors of his will 
but mr elliot would not act and the difficulties and distressed which thin refusal had hoped on her in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation had been such a could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened to without corresponding indignation 
anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to urgent applications from mrs smith which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and under a cold civility the name

anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was only themore inclined to wonder at the cow of her ﬁ'iend’e usual date of mind therewuonedrcumstnnceindlehinoryofher grienncu ofpnnicular irritation 
she hadgoodreamn to believe that kline property of her hand in the wuindhvhichhodbeen forman yeanundern m of representation for the payment of in own incumbnncee might be recoverable by proper men-um 
and thin propeny though not large would be enough to nulu her lively rich 
but there wan nobody to air in it 
or elliot would do nothing and she could do nothing herself only singled from personal exertion by heroine of july wukmmfm no other by her went of money 
she had no in connexion to ruin her even with their counsel and could not afford to chuse the niece of the law 
thin was a cruel aggravation of actually utreightened menu 
to feel that the ought to be in better circumstance that a little trouble in the right place might do it and to fear that delay might be even venting her claims war hand to bear 
it war on this point that the had hoped to engage anne’s good office with mr elliot 
she had previously in the anticipation of their marriage been very ve of long her friend by it 
but on being mutedthathecouldhavemadenomemptofthat nature since he did not even know her to he in bath rnsussron 
17 4 it immediately occurred that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest anne’s feelings as far as the observances due to mr elliot’s character would allow when anne’s refutation of the sun engagement changed the face of everything 
i while it took from her the new-formed he of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way 
after listening to this full description of mr elliot anne could not but express some surprise at mrs smith's having spoken of him so favourable in the beginning of their conversation 
a she had seemed to recommend and praise him i a my dear a was mrs smith's reply there was nothing else to be done 
i considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet have made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him 
than if he had been your husband 
my heart bed for you as i talked of happiness 
and yet he is sensible he is agreeable and with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless 
he was very unkind to his first wife 
hey were wretched together 
but she was too mount and giddy for respect and he had never love her 
i was willing to hope that you must are better 
v anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him as made her shoulders at the idea of the misery which must have followed 
it was just possible that she might have been persuaded by lady russell 
and under such a sum union which would have been most miserable in en time had disclosed all too late 
it was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived 
and one of the concluding arrange2:8 pmasion 
are of thin important conference which carried them through the greater pomp of the morning val that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to my smith in which hit conduct vial involved 
a cart 
11 nne went home to think over all that the had heard 
in ran her feeling were relieved by this know gaze of mr elliot 
there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him 
he stood opposed to captain wentworth in all hit own unwelcome obtrnl'veneu 
and the evil of his attention an night the immediate mischief he might have done wan considered with mention an unkind nnperplexed 
pity for him was all over 
but 31in wan the only point of relief 
in every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward the news more to dim mind to apprehend 
she was concerned for the disappointment and lady russell would be feeling 
for the mortiﬁcntionl which must be hanging over her father and finery and had all the silent of foreseeing many evil without knowing how to avert any one of them 
she was most than ill for her own knowledge of him 
she had never considered herself at entitled m mud for not tlighting an old friend like my smith but here war a reward indeed springing from it 
mrs smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done 
could the knowledge have been extended through her family 
but thin wan a vain idea she must talk to lady russell tell her con-alt g 
her and having done her best wait the event with it much composure at possible 
and after all her and want of composure would be in that quarter of passion

and appear quite anti-lied with the curtailed licence of devoting herself only half as much to sir walter m the would sure done otherwise 
to anne herself it w molt diam-ling to tea mr elliot enter the room 
and quite painful to have him approach and speak their 
shehadbeenueedbeforeto feel that he could not be always wise dancers but now the law sincerity in everything 
in attentive deference to her father contrasted with his former language was odious 
and when the thought of hit cruel conduct toward mn smith the could hardly hear the right of his 
t smiths and mine or the sound of his part call good sentiments 
she meant to avoid any week alteration of manner as might provoke a remonstrance on his tide 
it war a great object with her to escape all en cry or eclat 
but it was her intention to be at decided y cool to him an might be compatible with their relationship 
and to retrace u quietly up should the few of unnecueary intimacy the had been gradually along 
she will accordingly more red and more cool than the had been the night be more

she had me satisfaction in finding that he-wu really going out both the next morning going early 
end that he would be gone the greater part of two days 
he wan invited again to camden place the very evening of his return 
but from sunday to saturday evening his thence wan certain 
it was bad enough that a man clay should be always before her but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort 
it via an humiliation to reflect on the cloth deception practised on her other end elizabeth 
to consider the various sources of moiﬁﬁcation preparing for them on clay'i nellilhnell was not no complicate not no revolution s his 
and anne would have come indeed for the marriage at once with all in evils to clear of mr elliot’s aubtletiea in endeavouring to prevent it 
on friday morning he meant to go very early to lady russell and accompanied the necessary communication

were ushered into the room 
surprise war the largest emotion raised by their appearance 
but anne was reallyglad toutethem 
and the other were not to marry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome 
and at noon at it became clear that there their name relations were not arrived with any views of accommodation in that home sir walter and elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality and do the honour of it very well 
they were come to bath for a few days with mrs mangrove and were at the white hart 
so much wan pretty soon underatood 
but till sir walter and elizabeth were walking nasunsrou 
28th mary into the other drawing-room and regarding themselves with her admiration anne could not draw upon charlea'a brain for a regular history of their coming 
or an explanation of come amiling hint of particular business which had been omtatiou-ly dropped by mary on well an of some apparent confusion as to whom their port conﬁned of 
he then found that it contained of my mir-grove henrietta and captain harville beside their two selves 
he gave her a very plain intelligible account of the whole 1 a narration in which the law a great deal ofmoot characterittic proceeding 
the scheme had received in at imputed by captain harville wanting to come to bath on business 
he had begun to talk of it a week ago 
and by way of doing something a shooting wan over charlehad prepared coming with him and mr harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much up an advantage to her husband 
but mary could not bear to be left and had made herself i 
unhappy about it 
that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense or at an end 
but then it had been taken up by his father and mother 
his mother had some old friend in bath whom the wanted to see 
it war thought a good rtunity for henrietta to come and buy wedding others for herself and her till 
and in short it ended in being ill mother's pity that everything might be comfortable and eat to pain harville 
and he and mary were included in it by way of general convenience 
they had arrived late the night before 
my harville her children and captain benwick remained with mr mangrove and louisa at a return 
anne only surprise was that affair thou d be in forwardneaa enough for henrietta’e wedding-cleaves to be talked of 
she had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand 
but she learned from charles that 12 rnsmsrou 
men income into 1m to herself earle hadyzer had lived to by i friend to ho d i living for i youth who could not poniny china it undernunyyean

in the centre of home of the best preserve in the kingdom surrounded by three great proprieton ch more careful and jealous than the other 
and to two of the three at lent charlehayter might get i ipecial recommendation 
not that he will value it as he ought he observed 1 charles it too cool about toning 
that the worn of him is an extreme y glad indeed a cried anne 
a particularly glad that thin should happen 
and that of two date who both delerve equal well and who have always been such good friends e plenum prospects of one should not he during those of the other 
that they should be no equal in their prosperity and comfort 
i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both oh yet 
my father would be on well pleased if the gentlemen were richer but he hano other fault to and

however i do not mean to a they have not a right to it

and i am sure he inn always been a very kind liberal father to me 
mary does not above half like henrietti’a match 
she never did you know 
but the mainmast an 5 does not do him justice not think enough about winthrop 
i can not make her mend to the value the promise it in a very fair match in time go

they do everything to confer happiness i am sure 
what a blessing to young people to he in inch hand-l your father and mother-can totally free from all those ambition feelings which have led to in much misconduct and misery both in young and old 
i hit-ire you think louisa perfectly recovered now i

we had a famouiet-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my father rent harm 
and he played his part so well that i have liked him the better ever since here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charles following the other to admire morton and as reumsxou

she had no demand on her father or litter and her consequence was just enough increased by their handtome drawingroom 
elizabeth was for a short time uttering a good deal 
she felt that my mangrove and ill her party ought to he asked to dine with them 
but the could not bear to have the difference of eye the reduction of events which a dinner mutt betray witneleed by those who llld been always in inferior to the elliott of kellynch 
it war a struggle between propriety and vanity

and ill could not have received i more gratifying mention

and anne walk off with charleennd m213 to go and see her and henrietta directly 
her plan of living with lady russell must give way to the present 
they all three called in riven street for couple of mine 
but anne convinced herself that a day debility of the intended communication could be of no consequence end hunched forward to the white heart to lace again the pride md oornpaniom of the inn autumn with in eagerness of good-will which nun utociationr contributed to form 
they found on mangrove in her daughter within and by thernoelvel

the truth was that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to undergo the importance of a man lean air and appearance ll hie

the card was pointedly given and sir walter and elizabeth arm and disappeared 
the interruption had been short though reverse and ease and animation returned to most of these they left in the door that them out but not to anne 
she could think only of the invitation the had with and amusement witnessed and of the manner in which it had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather than gratification of polite acknowledgment rather than acceptance 
she knew him the law again in bits 
eyes and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept inch an offering an an atonement for all the insolence of the past 
her spirits sank 
he held the card in hit hand after they were gone an if my considering it

anne caught his eye law hii cheek

the party eeparaned 
the gentlemen had their own pursue the ladies proceeded on their own line and they met no more while anne belonged to them

they were reckoning him an certain but with her it was a growing tolicitude never appeared for ever minutes together 
he generally thought he would come because the generally thought he ought 
but it wan a case which the could not to hope into an poaitive act of duty or discretion an inevitably to d the suggestions of very appetite feeling 
she only roused herself from the breeding of thin readers agitation to let mr clay know that the had been seen with mr elliot three hours after his being exposed to be out of bath for having watched in vain for name intimation of the interview from the lady herself the determined to mention it and it seemed to her that there was guilt in my clay'a face an the likeness

she exclaimed 
however with a very tolerable imitation of nature

she had promised to he with the mutgmvea from breakfast to dinner 
her faith wan lighted

she could not keep her a pointer pimetually however 
the weather was an favourable and the had grieved over the rain on her friends account and felt it very much on her own before the will able to attempt the walk 
when she reached the white heart and made her way to the proper apartment the found herself neither arriving quite in time nor the hint to arrive

captain harville who had in truth been hearing none of it now left hie neat and moved to a window and anne seeming to watch him though it wan from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible that he wan inviting her to join him where he mood 
he looked at her with a mile and a little motion of the head which expressed a come to me i have something to any 
and the unaffected eaay kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really wan strongly enforced the invitation 
she roused herself and went to him

she had the kindest a good morning god bless you i a from captain harville but from him not a word nor look

tell me not that i am too late that such precious feelings are gone forever 
i offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it eight years and a half ago

in half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street again and the other two proceeded together and soon word 
enough passed between him to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk where the war of conversation would make the present hour a indeed and prepare it for all the morality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow 
there they exchanged a in those feelings and drove promises which had once he rest seemed to secure everything but which had been followed b so many many years of division and esu'angement 
here they returned again into the past n‘iore exquisiter has yet perhaps in their relation than when it had been rst rojecned 
more tender more tried more fixed in 3 knowledge of each other character truth and attachment more us to act more justified in acting 
and there as they only paced the gradual ascent heedless of every group around them seeing neither sauntering politicians hustling housekeepers ﬂirting girls nor nurcery-mnids and children they could indulge in those retrospection and acknowledgments and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the resent moment which were so poignant and so careless in interest 
all the little variations of the last weeks were gone through 
and of yesterday and to-day there could scarcely be an end 
she had not misled him 
jealousy of mr elliot had been the retarding weight the doubt the torment 
that had begun to operate in the ve hour of first meeting herin bath 
that had returned after a short suspension 
to ruin the concert

he had then written nothing wan to be retracted or qualiﬁed 
he persisted in having loved none but her 
she had never been supplanted 
e never even believed himself to see her equal 
thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge that he had been conlant unconceiourly nay unintentionally 
that he had meant forgets her and believed it to be done 
he had imagined himaelf indifferent when he had only been angry 
and he had been unjust to her merits because he had been a sufferer from them 
her character wan now fixed on his mind ii perfection itaelf maintaining the liveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness 
but he wan obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercrou had he learnt to do her justice and only at fame had be begun to demand himaelf 
at l me he had received daemon of more than one sort 
he patting admiration of mr elliot had at least roused him and the scene on the lobby and at the harville had fixed her superiority 
in hipreceding attempt to attach himself to louisa mangrove the attempt angry pride he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible 
that he had not cared could not care for louisa 
thou h till that day till the leisure for reflection which for owed it he had not undergo the effect excellence of the mind with which louita’s coo d in ill bear a companion or the perfect unrivalled hold it pleased over his own 
there he had learnt to distinguish between the motives of principle and the obstinacy of tclf-will between the daring of heedleaaneu and the resolution of a collected mind

thin ma be bad morality to conclude with but i believe it to truth 
and if such parties aucoeed how ihould a captain wentworth and an anne elliot with the advantage of security of mind eon-domes of right and one independent fortune between them fail of bearing down every oppoi'tion 
they might in fact 
have home down a great deal more than they met with for there wan little to distress them beyond the want of gracioumeu and warmth 
sir walter made no objection and elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned

who had not had principle or ienaeenough to maintain itself in the situation in which providence had placed him and who could give his daughter at present t a small part of the ill 
of ten thousand pounds which moat be here hereafter 
sir walter indeed though he had no affection for anne and no vanity fettered to make him really ha on the occasion wan very far from thinking it a match for her 
on the contrary when he law more of captain wentworth taw‘him repeatedly b daylight and him well he was very much much by his 
penon claims and felt that ill 
superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank 
and all this united by his welleounding name enabled sir walter at lot to both his pen with a very good grace for the intention the marriage in the volume of honour 
the only one among them whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety wan lady russell

it wan creditable to have no deter married and the might lower herself with having been ready inltnrrnental to the connexion by keeping anne with her in the autumn 5 and at her own litter must be better than her huahnnd’l sister it won very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than either clpmin benwick or persuasion

she had something to suffer perhaps when they came into contact lglin
