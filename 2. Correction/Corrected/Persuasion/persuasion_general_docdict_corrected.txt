i walter elliot of kellynch hall s in somcraeuhirc was a man who for his own amusement never took up any book but the baronetage 
there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a distrened one 
there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents 
there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt 
as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century and there if every other leaf were powerless he could read his own history with an interest which never failed this was the page at which the favourite volume always opened

vanity wan the beginning and end of sir walter elliot’s character vanity of person and of agitation 
he had been remarkably handsome in his youth and at ﬁfty-four wan still a very one man 
few women could think more of.t.heir personal appearance than he did nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society 
he considered the meeting of beauty at inferior only to the bleating of a baronetcy 
and the sir walter e iot who united these gifts 
wan the constant object of hit warmest t and devotion 
in good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment evinced to them he must have owed a wife rznsuasron 
3 of v or character in an thin deserved b his ownf'ylflaldeynelliot had been an excellent woman sensible and amiable whose judgment and conduct if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot had never required indulgence afterwards 
she had hnrnoured or softened or concealed his failings and provoked his real rcspccuibility for seventeen years 
and though not the very happiest being in the world herself had found enough in her duties her friends and her children to attach her to life and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them 
three girls the two eldest sixteen and fourteen was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath an awful charge rather to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited silly father 
she had however one very intimate friend a sensible deserving woman who had been brought by mng attachment to herself to settle close by her in the village of kellynch 
and on her kindness and advice lady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintainnnce of the good principles and instructions which she had been anxiously giving her daughters 
this friend and sir walter did not marry whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance 
thirteen years had passed away since lady elliot’s death and they were still near neighbours and minute friends and one remained a widower the other a widow 
that lady russell of steady age and character and extremely well provided for should have no thought of a second marriage needs no apology to the public which is rather apt to be unreasonably diuonmted when a woman doe marry again than when she does not but sir walters continuing in singlenesa requires explanation 
be it known then that sir walter like a good father having met with one or two private dis4 persuasion 
a appointment in very unmeonable applicationa himself on remaining single for his dear daughter take 
for one daughter his elder he would really have given up anything which he had not been very much tempted to do 
elizabeth had succeeded at sixteen to all that will pouible of her mother rightand connequence 
and being very handsome and very like himself her influence had always been great and they had gone on together moat happily 
two other children were of very inferior value 
mary had acquired a little artiﬁcial importance by becoming man charles muugmve 
but anne with an elegance of mind and women of character which must have placed her high with in people of real underatanding was nobody with either ther or sister 
her word had no weight her convenience wan always to give way 
the was only anne 
to lady rune“ indeed he wan a more dear and highly valued god-daughter favourite and friend 
lady russell loved them all but it was only in anne that the could fancy the mother to revive again 
a few years before anyone elliot had been a very pretty girl but her bloom had vanished early 
and as even in it height her father had found little to admire in her so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own 
there could be nothing in them now that she was faded and thin to excite his esteem 
he had never indulged much hope he had now none of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite worlt 
all equality of alliance mutt rest with elizabeth for mary had merely connected here with an old country family of respectability and large fortune and had therefore given all the honour and received none elizabeth would one day or other marry mitably

before

s generally speaking if there ha been neither ill health nor anxuety it in a time of life at which wan er any charm in lost 
it wan no with elizabeth till the same handsome mine elliot that the had begun to be thirteen year ago and sir walter might be exceeded therefore in r letting her age or at least be deemed only half a fool or thinking himself and elizabeth 3 blooming on ever amid the wreck of the good look of everybody else 
for he could plainly lee how old all the not of his family and acquaintance were growing 
anyone haggard mary coane every face in the neighbourhood worthing and the rapid increase of the crowd foot about lady eu-ell’e temple had long been i direct him 
elizabeth did not quite equal her fade in personal contentment 
thirteen years had seen her morsel of kellynch hall reading and directing with a eelf-poeaeuion and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than the was 
for thirteen years had lit been doing the honour and laying down the domestic law at home and leading the way to the chain and four and walking immediately after lady russell out of all the drawing-room and dining-room in the country 
thirteen winterl’ revolving from had been her opening every ball of credit which a canty neighbourhood allowed and thirteen spring when their blossoms as he travelled up to london with her father for a few weeks annual joe went of the great world 
she had the remembrance of all this he had the conicioulneea of being nine-and-twenty to give her name regrets and adorned apprehendone 
the wan fully utillied of being still quite an handsome an ever but the felt her approach to the yearn of danger and would have 72’0in to be certain of being pro rly limited by baronet

always to bepreaented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest litter made the book an evil 
and more than once when her father had left it n on the table our her had the closed it with save ye and pushed it away 
she had had a disappointment moreover which that book and especially the history if her own family mun ever prevent the remembrance of 
the heir preaumptive the very william walter elliot earp whose right had been no generoualy supported by her father had diaappointed her 
she had while a very young girl up soon up the had known him to be in the event of her having no brother the future baronet meant to marry him and her father had always meant that she should 
he had not been known to them a a boy 
but soon after lady elliot’s death sir walter had taught the acquaintance and though his ovemree had not been met with any wan-nth he had persevered in rocking it making allowance for the model drawing-hack of youth 
and in one of their ring excursions to london when elizabeth was in her at bloom mr elliot had been forced into the introduction 
he was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the law 
and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable and every plan in his favour was confirmed 
he was invited to kellynch hall 
he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year 
but he never came 
the following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeable again encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come 
and the next tidings were that he won married 
instead of pushing hit fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the home of elliot he had purchased independence persuasion

he would never disgrace his name so far

their two conﬁdential friends mr shepherd who lived in the neighbouring market town and lad russell were called on to advise them

quit kell och hall i 
the hint was immediately taken up r shepherd whose interest was involved in the city of sir walters stretching and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would he done without a change of abode 
a since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate he had no temple he aid 2 in confusing his judgment to be entirely on that side 
it did not appear to him that sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a home which had ouch a character of hoepitnlitynnd ancient dignity to support 
in any other place sir walter might judge for himself 
and would he looked up to at relating the mode of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household 
sir walter would quit kellynch hall 
and after a very few day more of doubt and indecision the great section of whither he should go wan settled and the 2m outline of thin important change made out 
there had been three alternatives london 
bath 
or another house in the country 
all annie s witched had been farther liner 
a small house in their own neighbourhood where th might still have lady runell's society still he near army and still have the pleasure of persuasion 
3 eometimee seeing the him and graver kellynch was the object of her ambition 
but the natural fate of anyone attended her in having something very o toe from her inclination fixed on 
she disliked th wind did not think it agreed with her 
and bath wan to be her home 
sir walter had at lint thought more of london 
but mr s rod felt that he could not he turned in london had been ikilful enough to did him from it end make bath preferred 
it was a much after place for a gentleman in his predicament he might there be important at comparatively little expenses 
two mterinl advantages of both over london had of course been given all their wi t inmate convenientdiuanee from kellynch only fifty miles and lady runell’l spending tome part of every winter there 
and to the very great infection of lady russell whoee lint view-entire rojected change had been for bath 
sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lnae neither coneequence nor enjoyment by getting there 
lady russell felt obliged to opposite her dear anne’known wialm 
it would he too much to expect sir walter to descend into a full home in hit own neighbourhood 
anyone here would have found 
the niortlﬁcationl of it more than the foresaw and to sir walters feeling 
they must have been dreadful 
and with regard to anne’s dislike of bath he considered it up a prejudice and mistake mining hint from the circumstance of her having been three am at school there after her mother's death 
and secondly from her happening to he not in perfectly good spirit the only winter which ill 
had agrwnrde spent there with herself 
lady russell wan fond of bath in about and dipped tothink itrnuu auitthern all 
indutoheryoung riend’t health by paying all the warm month with her r4 piwasion 
it kellynch lodge every danger would be avoided 
and it was in fact i change which must do both health and limit good 
anyone had been too little from home too little teen 
her spirits were not high 
a larger iociety would improve them 
she wanted her to he more known 
the nndeainbleneu of any other house in the name neighbouﬂiood for sir walter will certainly much lengthened by one part and a very material part of the scheme 
which had been happily engrafted an the beginning 
he was not only to quit his home but to ice it in the hand of then i trial of fortitude which monger head than sir walter s have found too much 
kellynch hall wan to be let 
thin however was a profound secret not to be breathed beyond their own circle 
sir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to delight letting his hook 
mr shepherd had once mentioned the word 
advice but never dared approach it again 
sir walter upturned the idea of its being offered in any manner 
forbid the list hint being dropped of hit having inch an intention 
and it wan on y on the apparition of hit being ntaneoualy solicited by name moot unexceptionable app infant on his arm terms and up a great favor that he would let it at i 
how quick come the reaction for ap roving what we like 
lady russell had another excel eat one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walter and his family were to remove from the country 
elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy which the wished to thee interrupted 
it was with a laugh of mr shepherd 
who had returned after an unprolpenonl mnrria e to her father home 
with the additional burden of two children 
she wan i clever young woman who understood the art of placing 
4th art of pleating.» inn at persuasion 
i s kellynch hall 
and who had made herself in uncertahle w elliot a to have been already myself there more than once in spite of all that lady rune who thought it n friendnhip quite out of place could hint of action and relieve 
lady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth and enabled to love her rather became he would love her than because elizabeth deserve it 
she had never received from her‘more than outward mention nothing beyond the obeervnncee of complaining 
lad never succeeded in any point which ill 
wanted to marry again previous inclinalion 
she had been badly very earnest in trying to get anne incl in the visit to london lende open to in the injustice and all die credit of the eel ih lmngernenu which shut her out and on many lee-er occaliona had endeavoured or give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgment and experience 
but always in vain elinheth would go her own way 
and never had he pursued it in more decided opponu'on to lady russell than in chin selection of my clay 
turning from the moiety of lo deserving a line to bestow her edition and conscience on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility 
from duration mn clay was in lady runell’o minute a very unequal and in her character she believed i very dangerous companion 
and a removal that would leave my clay behind and bring i choice of more irritable intimatewithin min elliot reach wn therefore an object of ﬁrm-rate importance 
6d pnsuasrou 
that 3 
a mistake leave to observe sir walter laid mr shepherd one morning at kellynch hall at he laid down the newspaper that the potent juncture in much in our favour 
thin peace will be turning all our rich naval oﬂicen aahore 
they will be all wanting a home 
could not be 1 better time sir walter for having a choice of tenants very reeponaible tenant many a noble fortune ha been made during the war 
if a rich admiral were to come in our way sir walter 
a he would be i very lucky man s herd d sir walter 
2 that if all i have to reel er a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him 
rather the greatest prizefof all let him have taken ever to many before 
hey she herd 
mr shepherd aughed n he knew he mun at thirst and then added 
— a i pmme to observe sir walter that in the way of business gentlemen of the heavy are well to deal with 
i have had a little knowledge of their method 
of doing business 
and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are an likely to make desirable tenant nu any let of people one should meet with 
therefore sir walter what i would take leave to suggest it that if in consequence of any rumour 
getting abroad of our intention 
which must be contemplated a a pitiable thing became we know how difficult it in to keep the action and delight of one part of the world from the notice and curiously of the other 
conquuence has its tax 
i john shepherd might conceal any family-matter that i choose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me 
but sir walter elliot hal eyes upon him which it may be very persuasion 
l 7 difficult to elude 
and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some memoir of the truth should get abroad 
in the w ration of which as i was going to observe since app ications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to 
and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of reply ng 
sir walter on y nodded 
but soon afterwards rising and pacing the room he observed musically— there are new among the gentlemen often have i imagine who would not be surprised to and these m in a house of this description 2 they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune a said my clay for mrs clay was present her father had driven her over nothing being of so much use to mrs clay’s health as a drive to kellynch but i quite agree with my father in thinking s tailor might be a very detirahle tenant 
i have known a good deal of the profession 3 and besides their lihenlity they are so neat and careful in all their ways l these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe 
everything in and about the house would be taken such excellence of l the gardens and ahruhheries would he kept in almost as high order all they are now 
you need not be afraid miss elliot of put own sweet gower gardens being neglected 
all to all that rejoined sir walter coolly 2 supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it 
i am not particularly to favour a tenant 
the rock would be open to him of mum and few navy o cert or men of any other description can have had such a range 
but what restrictious i 8 persuasion 
might impose on the are of the plenum-grenade it another thing 
i am not fond of the idea 
of my chin 
a her being always a roach-kale 
and i should recommend miu elliot to on her guard with mpectro her power garden 
i am very little to grant 4 tenant of kellynch hall any extrao inary favour i near you be he tailor or soldiers 
after a than plate mr shepherd returned to ray 
— a in all the calm there are embluhed onset which make eve thing plain and en between landlord and tenant 
our interest sir alter in in pretty wife handl 
depend anon me for taking care that no tenant hu more than he jun rights 
i venture to hint that sir walter elliot can not be half aloud for his own at john shepherd will be for him

it seemed an if mr shepherd in thin anxiety to speak sir walter s good will towards a naval office at tenant had been lifted with foresight 
for the very first application for the home war from an admiral croft with whom he shortly afterward fell into company in attending the quarter tension at taunton 
and indeed he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent 
by the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make admiral croft wan a native of someneuhire who having acquired a very handsome fortune wat within to settle in hit own country and had come down to aunt in order to look at tome advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited him

not likely to make the swollen difﬁculty about terms only wanted a comfortable home and to get into it at noon an possible

knew what rent a mdy-fumilhed house of that comequenoe might fetch 
should not have been surprised if sir walter had naked more 
had inquired aboutthe manor 
would be glad of the deputation certainly but made no great point of it 
said he sometimes took out a gun but never killed 
quite the gentleman 
mr shepherd wan eloquent on the subject pointing out all the circumncea ofthe adlniral'a uni which made him peculiarly duh-able an a tenant

and a very well-epoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be continued he 
naked more queea'one about the house and term nnd taxer than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant with hulineal

ai mr shepherd perceived that thin conception of the croft did them no vice with sir walter he mentioned it no more 
returning with all his zeal to dwell on the circnmamnceu more included in their favour

it proceeded however 
and though sir walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think them inﬁnitely too well i 
in being to rent it on the highest terms he was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty and autinrin'ng him to wait on admiral croft who kill retrained ll barton and x a day for the home being seen

sir wdterwunotvery wile 
hatuillhelnd experience enough of the world to feel that a more unoh‘ ble tenant in all euenﬁalr than admiral cro bid fair to he could hardly offer 
so for went he demanding

in all their dealing and intercom-e sir walter elliot mun ever have the proof cadence 
nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth but her inclination war growing no strong for a removal that 
he war happy to have it vexed and excited by a tenant at hand 
and not a word to suspend decirion was uttered by her 
mr shepherd was completely empowered to act 
and no sooner had each an end been reached than anyone who had been a more attentive llltl‘nel to the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her ﬂurhed cheeks and at the walked along a favourite grove laid with a gentle high a few months more and be perhaps may be walking here

and having no parent living found a home for half a year at monkfonl 
he war at that time a remarkably one young man with a grat deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancy 
and annoy an extremely elma 
girl with gentleman modetty taste and feeling 
all the mr o attraction on either side might have been enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love 
but the encounter of ouch lavilh recommendations could not fail 
they were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and deeply in love 
it would be difficult to lay which had been highest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest the in receiving his decorations and proposed or he in having them accepted 
a short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short one 
trouble noon arose 
sir walter on being applied to without actually withholding hil consent or ca no it should never be gave it all the negative of great astonishment great coldneu great silence and a profound resolution of doing nothing for his daughter 
he thought it a very degrading alliance 
and lady russell though with more temper and pardonahle pride received it as a most unfortunate one 
anyone elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mind to throw herself away at nineteen 
involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself to recommend him and no 
hope attaining allluerme but in the chance of a most uncertain profession and no confession to secure even hit farther ride in that profession would be indeed i throwing away which she grieved to think of l anne elliot so young 
known to so few to be matched off by a manger without alliance or fortune 
or rather united by him into a name of most wearing anxioua youth26 msunslox

he had always been lucky 
he knew he should he i will 
such conﬁdence 
powerful in in own warmth and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it mun have been enough for anyone 
but lady uuell jaw it very differently 
his languid temper and fearless of mind operated very differently on her 
she law in it but an aggravation of the evil 
it only added a dangerous character to himself 
he wan brilliant he wan headstrong 
lady russell had little not for wit and of anything approaching to impnidence a honor 
she deprecated the complexion in every ght 
such opposition at these feelings produced was more than anyone could combat 
young and gentle uohe wan it might at have been possible to within her ﬁlthcr'l ill-will though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her liner 
but lad russell whom the had always loved and relied on co d not with much neadineu of opinion 
and such tenderness of manner be continually dividing her in vain 
she was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing indincreet improper hardly capable of succour and not deserving it 
but it we not a merely selﬁsh caution under which she acted in putting an end to it 
had the not imagined himself conaulting l’lll good even more than her own she could hardly have given him up 
the belief of persuasion 
2 7 being prudent and ielf-denying principally for li advantage was her chief consolation under misery of a parting a final ning 
and every consolation required for the h to encounter all the additional pain of opinions on his side mull unconvinced and unbending and of hi 
feeling him f ill used by in forced a reii’nquiahmenn he had left the country in consequence 
a few month had been the beginning and the end of their acquainunce 
but not with a few months ended angel there of suffering from it 
her attachment and regret had for a in time clouded every enjoyment of youth and an early foot of bloom and print had been their lasting effect 
more than even year were gone iince thin little history of sorrowful interest had reached in close 
and time had softened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him but he had been too dependent on time alone 
no aid had been given in change of place except in one visit to bath soon after rupture or in any novelty or entanglement of society 
no one had ever come within the kellynch circle who could bear a comparison with frederick wentworth i he wood in her memory 
no second attachment the only thorough 
natural happy and ancient cure at her lime of m had been possible to the nice tone of her mind the faan'diuuaneu of her taste in the small limit of the society around them 
she had been solicited when about two-und-twenty to change her name by the young man who not long afterward found a more willin mind in her young er litter and lady russell had averted her a for charles muegmve was the eldest son of a man whose landed property and general importance were second in that country only to sir waters and of good character and appearance 
and however lady rnuell might have c 28

she did not blame ley russell he did not blame herself for having been guided by her 
but he felt that were my young person in similar circummncec to apply to her for councel they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchednels inch uncertain ﬁxture good 
she wapenuaded that under every disadvantages of din probation at home and every anxiety attending hil pm cation all their probable fears delay and dilapntmenu the should yet have been i happier woman in maintaining the engagement than he had been in the sacrifice of it 
and that the fully believed had the usual share had even more than 11 ml uhare ofull ouch uoli' clouded and see been their without reference to the actual 2 of their case which an it happened

she had only navy lists and newapapern for her authority but the could not doubt his being rich 
and in favour of hi 
company she had no man to believe him married 
how el uent could anyone elliot have been 
how eloquent at cut were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment 
and a cheerful confidence in purity again that over-anxioua caution which seem to insult exertion and diurnal providence 
she had been forced into prudence in her youth the learned romance up the grew older the natural queen of an unnatural be nning 
it all these circumstances recollections and feeling she could not hear that captain wentworth’a i'lﬂel‘ was likely to live at kell ch without a revival of former pain 
and many a trot l and many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea 
she often told herself it was full before the could harden her nerves sufficiently to fee the continual discussion of the croft and their business no evil 
she war auiated however by that perfect indifferent and apparent unconacioueneu among the only three of her own friend the secret of the part which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it 
she could do justice to the no pity of lad ruuell’s motives in this over those of her father elizabeth 
ll could honour all the better feelings of her calmneu 
but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it aprung 
and in the event of admiral croft’s really uking kellynch hall the rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her of the part being known to those three only among her so runsmsrorr 
connexion by whom no syllables the believed would ever be whilperedﬁnd in the trultthatnmonghigthe brotherme with whomhehadbeenreidinglud received any information of their than-lived engagement 
that brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man and moreover a tingle mm it the time the had a fond dependent on no human creatures having heard of it from him 
the killer n croft had then been out of england icoonrpanyin her husband on a foreign station end her own sitter mary had been at school whilst all occurred 3 and never admitted by the pride of name and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge of it afterward 
with thee more the hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the croft which with lady russell ltill redder in kellynch and mary ﬁxed only three miles oil must be anticipated need not involve any particular awkwardness 
thear 17 
n the morning a inted for admiral and my croft’t ieeing ellynch hall anne found it met natural to take her almost daily walk to lady ruuell’a and keep out of the way till all was over 
when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had minded the opportunity of seeing them 
thin meeting of the two rtiel proved highly satisfactory and decided the who e business at once 
each lady wan previoutly well diapered for in agreement and saw nothing therefore but good manners in the other 
and with regard to the gentlemen there was inch an hearty good humour such an open muting libemlity on rsnsussrou 
31 the admiral’s side as could not but inﬂuence sir walter who had besides been scattered into his very best and most lished behaviour by mr shepherd assurances of his ‘ng known by report to the admiral as a model of good breeding 
the house and grounds and furniture were approved the croft were approved terms time every thing and every body was right 
and mr shepherd’s clerks were set to work without there having been a single liminary difference to of a that 
this in nature showeth.” sir walter without hesitation declared the admiral to be the best-looking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to by that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where 
and the admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife as they drove back through the park 
i thought we should soon come to a deal my clear in spite of what they told us at taunton 
the coronet will never set the thames on here but there seems no harm in him 
reciprocal comaplimentn which would have been esteemed about 2 ll 
the croft were to have possession at michaelmas 
and as sir walter proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month there was no time to be lost in making every dependant arrangement 
lad russell convinced that anyone would not be allow to be of any use or any importance in the choice of the house which they were going to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she 
might convey her to bath herself after christmas 
but having engagements of her own which must take her from kell much for several weeks she was unable to give the fun invitation she wished and annoy 32 mason 
thonghdmtingthepodrlehmofswaherinaﬂ thewhinghnoand mforegoallthe inﬂuenoenneetandao oftheamumnalnootha intbeeountry didnotthinkthat evaytbingoonidemd something occurred however to give her a different duty 
mary often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming anyone when anything was me butter was indiapoaed 
and unforeseeing tint she could not have a day health all the autumn entreated or rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to one to us to

and annoy glad to be thought of acme use glad to have anything marked out an a duty and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country and her own dear country readily a reed to my 
this invitation o ary’l removed all lady russell difficulties and it was con nearly noon settled that anyone could not go to bath ti l lady russell took her and that all the intervening time should be divided between a cross cottage and kellynch lodge 
so far a wan perfectly right 
but lady rnnell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it hunt on her which was mi'i clay'being engaged to go to bath with sir walter and elizabeth an a most important and valuable assistant to the persuasion 
31 latter in ill the business before her 
lady russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered grieved and feared 
and the front it contained to anyone in mrs clay s being of so much use while anyone could be of none was i very sore aggravation 
anyone herself was become hardened to such nﬂ'ronu but she felt the importance of the arrangement uite st keenly a lady russell 
with a great deal is quiet observation and a knowledge which she often wished less of her father s character the was sensible that results the most serious to his flaming from the intimacy were more than possible 
she did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind 
mrs clay had reckless and a projecting tooth and s clumsy wrist which he was continually making severe remrks n in her absence 
but the was young and certainly rt gether well-looking and possessed in an acute mind and usiduous pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merelypersnnal might have been 
anyone was so impressed by the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perc bible to her sister 
she had little hope of succour t elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself should never she thought have reason to reproach her for giving no warning 
she spoke and seemed only to offend 
elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantly answered for each party's perfectly knowing their situation 
a mrs clay said she warmly d never forgets who she is 
and an i am rather better acquaian with her sentiments than you can be i can assure you that upon the of marriage they are particularly nice and that she reprobures all equality of condition and rank more 34 nasuasrou 
none than most people 
and at to my father i reallyalmldnothave thoughtthathev/hohaakept himoelflin elolnngfor our lkel need be expected now 
if ll clay were a very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her to much with me

you must have heard him notice mr clare ﬁecklea 
a there is hardly any personal defect replied anne 2 which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to 
i think very differently anlwered elizabeth shortly 
an agrmhle manner may out off handsome features but can never alter plain ones 
however at any rate at i have a great deal more at stake on thin point than anybody elm can have i think it rather unneceuary in you to he advising me

glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless of doing good 
elizabeth 
though reaming the suspicion 
might yet be made observant by rt 
the last choice of the four carriage-hone war to draw sir walter min elliot and mrs clay to bath 
the party drove off in very good spirit 
sir walter prepared with condeacending how for all the afflicted tenantry and concern who might have had a hint to pnsussron 
3 how themselves and annoy walked up it the same time in a sort of desolate tranquillity to the lodge where he was to spend the tint week 
her friend was not in better lpll'lll than herself 
lady russell felt this brak-up of the family exceedingly 
their respecmbility was as dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become tedious by habit 
it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds and still worse to anticipate the new herds they were to fall into 
and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of to altered i village and be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft lim arrived she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up anne 
accordingly their removal was made together and annoy was set own at uppercrou cottage in the list stage of lady russell’s van 
uppercrou was a moderate-sized village which a few years back had been completely in the old english style containing only two houses interior in appearance to those of the women and labourers 
the mansion of the squire with its high walls great gates and old trees substantial and nnmodernized and the compact tight panonage enclosed in its own neat garden with a vice and a palm-tree trained round it easements 
but upon the marriage of the young squire it had received the improvement of a farm-house slavered into i cottage for his residence and uppercrou cottage with its viranda french windows and other prettinessel was quite as likely to catch the travellers eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the great house about a quarter of a mile farther on 
here anyone had often been staying 
she knew the ways of uppercrou as well as those of kellynch 
the two families were so continually meeting so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's house at ill 36 newnsrou 
honmthnitwunthereurpﬁcm her toﬁndmary alone 
but being alone her being unwell and out of spirit was almost a matter of course 
though better endowed than the elder liner mary had not accept undertttnding nor temper 
while well and happy and properly attended to the had great humour and excellent spirits 
but any indi titlon tunlt her completely 
she had no retourcet or longitude 
and inserting a conﬁdenhle tillers of the elliot telf-importonce wet very prone to add to ever other dimeu that of fancying henelf neglected and it suited 
in person the wart inferior to both tittered and had even in her bloom only reached the did pity of being 
a one girl 
she what now lying on the dead tour of the pretty little drawing-mom 
the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing thahhy under the influence of four manner and two children 
and on anne't appearing greeted her with 
a so you are come at hm 
i began to think i should never tee you 
i am to ill i can hardly tpeak 
i have not been a creature the whole morning 
d i am sorry to and you unwell replied anne 
b you tent me such a good account of yourself on thursday 
yet i made the heat of it 
i always do but i want very far from well at the time 
and i do not think i ever want to ill in my life at i have been all this morning very unfit to he left alone i am tore 
so pote i were to he seized of a burden in tone dread ul way and not able to ring the hell i so lady russell would not get out 
i do not think the hat been in this house three time that turner 
anyone said what was proper and enquired after her husband 
a 0h 
charlet it out shooting 
i have not seen him since seven o'clock 
he would go though i told him how ill i want 
he said he should not stay persuasion 
3 7 outlong 
but he hat never come back and now it in alrnottone 
iamreyoui have not seen a tool thin whole long morning 
you have had your little boy with you i d ye an long an i could bear their noise 
but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good 
little charles does not mind i word i any and walter it growing quite as bad 
a well you will noon be better now a replied anne cheerfully 
you know i always cure you when i come 
how are your neighbour at the great home e 
i can give you no account of them 
i have not seen one of them to-day except mr mangrove 
who just dropped and spoke through the window but without getting all hit home 
and though i told him how ill i was not one of them have been near me 
it did not happen to suit the main marvel i suppose and they never ut themselves out of their way 
ou will tee them yet perhapa before the morning is gone 
it in early 
d i never want them i assure you 
the talk and laugh a great deal too much for me 
oh 
sure i am in very unwell 
it was quite unkind of you not to come on thunday.” 2 my dear mary recollect what comfortable account you lent me of yourself 
you wrote in the cheerful manner and aid you were perfectly well and in no hurry for me 
and that being the case you must be aware that my will would be to remain with lady russell to the last and besides what i felt on her account i have all been so busy have had it much to do that i could not very conveniently have left kell much sooner a ear me 
what can jon possibly have to do 2 d a great many things i assure you 
more than i can recollect in a moment 
but i can tell you some 
i 38 persuasion 
hevebeen making i duplicate of the catalogue of my other books and i have been several times the men with mackenzie trying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeth plants are for lady russell 
i have had all my own little con 
term to arrange book and music to divide and all my trunk repack from not having underfoot in time what wan intended as to the wagon and one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying nature going to almost every house in the parish up a none of takelenve.. i was told that they wished it 
but all these things took up i great deal of time 
a oh well i 
and after a moment paused a but you have never snaked me one word about our dinner at the pool yenerday 
did you go then 
i have made no inquiries because i concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party 
oh yes 
i went 
i was very well yesterday 
nothing at all the matter with me till thin morning 
it would have been strange if i had not gone 
4 i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a plenty party 
nothing remarkable 
one always known beforehand what the dinner will be and who will be there 
and it it to very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one own 
mr and my mangrove took me and we were in crowded 
they are both 10 very large and take up so much room 
and mr mangrove always rite forward 
so there was i crowded into the back meat with henrietta and louisa 
and i think it very likely that my illness to-day may be owing to it a little farther perseverance in patience and formed cherfulneu on anne’s aide produced nearly a cure on to 
she could noon at upright on the sofa and begun to hope the might be able to leave it by dinnerpersuasion 
39 time 
then forgetting to think of it she was at the other end of the room beautifying a noaega 
then she ate her cold melt 
and then she war we enough to i little walk 
a where shall we go 
a said the when they were ready 
if you will not like to call it the gem house before they have been to lee you 
d i have not the smaller 
objection on that account 2 replied anne 
i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as men and the mist mungmves 
b c 
oh 
they ought to call upon you as soon as possible 
they ought to feel what in due to you an m deter 
however we may as well go and sit with them a little while and when we have got tlut over we can enjoy our walk anyone had always thought such a style of intercourse highly in kent 
but she had ceased to endeavour to check it tom believing that though there were on each side continual subjects of offence neither family could now do without it 
to the get home accordingly they went to sit the frill half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour with a small carpet and shining floor to which the present daughter of the house were usually giving the proper sir of conclusion by a grand piano-forte and a harp ﬂower-stands and little tables laced in every direction 
oh

there was a numerous family 
but the only two grown up ex in charles were henrietta and louisa young yes of nineteen and twenty who had brought from a school at enter all the usual stock of accomplishments and were now like thousand of other young ladies living to he fashionable happy and merry 
their dresl had every advantage their faces were rather pretty their spirits extremely good their manners embarrassed and latent

none had not wanted this visit to uppercua to learn that a removal from one net of people to another though at a dance of only three miles will often include a total change of conversation opinion and idea 
she had never been staying there before without being struck by it or without willing that otherelliota could have her advantage in seeing how unknown or unconlidered there 
were the affair which at kellth hall were treated an of such eoenl publicity and pervading interest 
yet with all this experience the believed the mun

for certainly cumin 31 the did with a heart full of the subject which had en completely occu ying both how in kellynch for many weeks the had acted rather more curiously and ayrnputhy than the sound in the ieparntc but very rimilar remark of mr and my mangrove so mianne sir w tear and your anger are gone

she could only resolve to amid such aelf-delmion in mire and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly lympathiaiog friend at lady russell 
the mr mulgrovel had their own game to guard 4 2 persuasion 
and to decay their own hornet dogs and wept to engage them and the females were fully occificdfl'i all the other common subject of homelreepiog na'ghhoun dreu dancing and music 
she acknowledged it to be very lining that every little iocial commonwealth ihould dictate its own matters of dinooune 
and hoped ere long to become a not worth member of the one the was now tnoaplanted into 
it the prospect of spending at least two month at i’hei’ci'di 
it w highly incumbent on her to clothe her image nation her memory and all her idea in a much of ppercrou us she had no dread of then two months 
mary me not it repulsive and utterly an elizabeth nor to inacce-the to all influence of hen 
father was there anything among the other come next part 
of the cottage inimical to comfort 
he wan away on friendly termwith her brother-in-law 
and in the children who loved her nearly ii well and repeated her a great deal more than their mother she had an object of interest amusement and wholesome exertion 
charlel mangrove was civil and agreeable 
in tense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation or grace to make the past as they were connected together at all a dangerous contemplation 
though at the lame time anyone could believe with lady russell that a more equal match might have greatly improved him 
and that a woman of real undermnding might have given more consequence to ill 
center and more ueefulneu irrationality and elegance to hit habit and pursuing 
a it was he did nothing with much zeal but sport 
and his time was otherwise trilled away without benefits from books or anything else 
he had very good spirit which never ieemed much affected by his wife occasional lownel bore with her unrealonablcnm sometimes to anne’s wuasion 
421 admiration and upon the whole though there war very often a little diugreernent in which the had eometimet morerhuethanuhewinhed heing appealed to both parties they might put for a happy couple 
they were a way perfectly agreed in the want of more money and i strong inclination for a handsome present from his father 
but here an on most topics he had the superiority for while mary thought it a great than that such a t was not made he always contented for his face i having many other use for ‘llil money and a right to mend it ud be liked 
all to the management of their children he theory war much better than hit wife and his practice not no bad 
i could manage them very well if it were not for mary’a interference wan what anne often heard him lay and had a good deal of faith in 
but when litteniug in turn to mary reproach of a charles la the children so that i can not get them into any of er 4 the never had the intellect temptation to lay a very true 
one of the lean 
agreeable crunch of her residence there wan her being treated with too much conﬁdence ball and nag too much the secret of the complaint of each house 
known to have nine influence with her lined the wan continually equalled or it lean receiving hint to exert it beyond what was advisable 
d i wish you could penua e mary not to always fanc g herself ill waa charlet’u language 
and inns un ppy mood than poke mary i do believe if charles were to see me dying he would not think there war anything the matter with me 
i am sure anne if you would you might persuade him that i really am very ill 
a great deal worse than i ever owu 
mary'declaration war 
i hate tending the children to the great home though their grandmamma ll d 44 nesmsrou 
always wanting to thee them for the humour and indulge them to locks i degree 
and given them to much trash and wet things that the are our to come back lick and crowd for the rent o the day 
and my mangrove took the list opportunity of being floor with annas to my 2 oh i mine anne i can not help wishing mn charles had a little of your method with that children 
they are quite different 
creature with you 
but to here in general they are no spoil it in a pity you can not put your litter in the way of managing they are a one healthy children a ever were ten poor little dean 
without partiality 
but my charles known no more how they ihould be treated 
l bleu rue 
how troubleeome they are sometimes 
i nature you mind anne it prevent my writhing to toe them it our home it often at i otherwise should 
i believe my charles it not quite played with my not inviting them oftener 
but you know it ll very bad to have children with one that one in obliged to be checking every moment 
do n't do this a and do n't do that 
a or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than in good for them l she had this communication moreover from mary 
a mr mangrove think all her servant to stay that it would be high union to call it in question 
but i am sure without exaggeration that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid instead of being in their business are gadding about the village all along 
i meet them wherever i go 
and i declare i never go twice into my nursery without feeling something of them 
if jemima were not the truant oteadiest creature in the world it would be enough to spoil her 
for she tells me they are now i tempting her to take a walk with them 
e and on n muegrove’l ride it was a i make 3 rule of never interfering in any of my daughter-in-law eon.ceml for i know it would not do 
but i shall tell you persuasion 45 min annoy because you may be able to set things to right 
that i have no very good opinion of my charlee’u nursery-maid i hear mange stories of her 
the in away upon the glad 
and from my own knowledge i can declare the in such a line-dressing lady that the in enough to ruin any iervnntl the come near 
my charles quite mean by her i know 
but i just ve you this hint that you may be upon the watch 
use if you see anything miss you need not be afraid of mentioning it again 
it won mary s complaint that man mangrove wuveryapt not to give her the presence that her due when they dined at the great home with other families 
and the did not lee any remn why the wutobeconlidered to much it home one lone her place 
and one day when anyone wan walking with only the main mulgrovee one of them after talking of unity people of rank and jealousy of rank laid a i have no scruple of observing to you how noneensical some persons are about their place become i the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it 
but i with anybody would give mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if the were not to very tenncioua especially if she would not be always of putting herself forward to take place of morcar 
nobody doubts her right to have pretence of mr but it would be more becoming in her not to be always ineining on it 
it ll not that man came about it the lent in the world but i know it is taken notice of by many per 
none how was annas to let all these matters to right 
she could do little more than linen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each to the other 
give them all hint of the forbearance neceuary between ouch near neighbour and make thone hint broadest which were meant for her linter’e beneﬁt

in another reapectyherviait began and proceeded very well 
her own spirit improved by change of lace and rub cut by being removed three rnilee from kellynch 
mary ailments deafened by having a constant nom noon and their daily inrereoune with the other fam y since there wan neither euperior affection conﬁdence nor employment in the cottage to be interested by it wan rather an advantage 
it war certainly carried near or far as possible for they met every morning a hardly ever epent an evening minder 
but the believed they ihould not have done to well without the eight of mr and mr muegrvve’l able form in the virtual places or without the talking laughing and singing of their daughters 
he played a great deal better than either of the main muegrovee but having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parents to it by and fancy themselvee delighted her performance wan little thought of only out of civility or to refresh the other arm the war well aware 
she knew that when the played the was giving pleasure only to herself 
but this was no new sensation 
excepting one short period of her life the had never since the age of fourteen never since the loan of her dear mother known the happiness of being listened to or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste 
in magic she had been always used to feel alone in the world 
and mr and my mulgrnve’e fond partiality for their own daughter performance and total indifference to any other person gave her much more pleasure for their lakes than mortiﬁcation for her own 
the sty at the great home war enmetimee increased y other company 
the neighbourhood was not large but the groves were visited by everybody and had more dinner-parties and more callere more visitor invitation and by chance than any other family

a beloved home made over to them 
all the precious room and rapture m and he running to own other eyes and flies limbs lfmsl could think of much clue on the 27th of september 
and he had thin lympathetic touch in the evening from mary who on having occasion to note down the day of the month exclaimed dear me in not thin the day the croftwere to come to kellynch 
i am glad i did not think of it before 
how low it make me i 
the croft took communion with true naval alert and were to be ned 
mary deplored the necessity for herself 
a nobody knew how much the should auﬁ'er 
she ihould put it of an long an she could 
a but was not easy till the had talked charles into driving her over on an early day and war in a very animated comfortable at 
of imaginary agitation when he came back 
anyone had very uncerer rejoiced in there being nomeanlofhergoing 
she however toeeethe croft and was glad to be within when the visit was returned 
they came the master of the house viii 48 persuasion 
notlthome butthetwoslltenwere together 
and as it chanced that mrs croft fell to the share of anyone while the admiral sat by mary and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little ha i 
she was well able to watch for a likeness and if it fair ed her in the features to catch it in the voice brain the turn of sentiment and expression 
mrs croft 
though neither tall nor fat had a squareness uprights and vigour of form which gave importance to her person 
she had bright dark eyes good teeth and altogether an agreeable face 
though her reddened and weather-beaten complexion the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem to have lived some yearn longer in the world than her real eightand-thirty 
her manners were open easy 
and decided like one who had no distrust of herself and no doubts of what to do 
without any approach to coarseness however or any want of good humour 
anyone gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration towards herself in all that related to kellynch and it pleased her especially a she had stationed herself in the very warm half minute in the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest s m in of any knowledge or sup in on mrs croft’s idlemto give a bias of an sort 
she was quite easy on that head and consequently y full of enough and courage till for a moment electriﬁed by mrs cro as suddenly saying 
a it was you and not your sister i and that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this country 
anyone hoped she had lived the age of blushing 
but the age of emotion she certainly had not 
a perhaps you may not have heard that he in married 10 added mm croft 
she could now answer as she ought 
and viii happy persuasion 
149 to feel when my croft s next word explained it to be mr wentworth of whom the spoke that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother 
she immediately felt how reasonable it was that mrs croft should be thinking and speaking of edward and not of frederick 
and with shame at her own forgetfuloess applied herself to the knowledge of their former nei libonr’s present state with proper interest 
he re 
was all tranquillity 
till just as they were he heard the admiral ay to mary 
— a e are expecting a brother of my croft’s here soon 
i dare any you know him by me 
he was cut short by the eager attack of the line boys clinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go 
and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pocket em to have another moment for fishing or recollect what he had begun anne we left to persuade herself an well an she could that the name brother must still be in question 
she could not however reach such a degree of certainly as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house where the croft had previously been calling 
the folk of grat house were to spend the evening of this day the cottage 
and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot the coach wan beginning to be listened for when the youngest mice ntgrove walked in 
that she was coming to apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves war the first black idea 
and ma was quite ready to be aﬁ'ronted when louisa made a 1 right by saying that the only came on foot 
to leave more room for the harp which was bringing in the carriage 
e and i will tell you our reason d she added and all about it 
i am come on to give you notice that so nasuasrou 
papa and mamma are out of appear a thieevening 
mamma 
the in thinking to much of poor richardl and agreed it dbebeettohavetheharp for it seem to announce her more than the comforter 
i will tell you why the in out of spirit 
hen the croft called this morning they called here afterwardl did not they vi they happened to ray that her brother captain entworth 
ll jun returned to england or paid or something and in coming to see rh almost directly 
and most unluckily it came into mamma’a head when they were gone that wentworth or something very like it was the name of poor richard’r psalm at one time 
i do not know when or where but a great while before he died poor fellow and upon looking over his letters thing the found it war no and it perfectly ants that thin coat be the very man and her head it quite full of it and of poor richard i so we must all be an merry ii we can that the may not be dwelling upon each gloomy thing the real crrcumnancea of thin pathetic piece of family hunters were that the muagrovea had had the ill fortune of a very uoubleaome hopeleu son and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year 
that he had been sent to sea because he wan stupid and unmanageable on shore 
that he had been very little cared for at any time by bit family though quite at much at he deserved 
seldom hard of and parcel at all regretted when the intelligence of hit death a road had worked in way to uppercrou two year before 
he had in fact though he line were now doing all they could for him by calling him a poor richard d been nothing better than a thick-headed unfeeling unproﬁtable dick mangrove who had never done anything to entice himself to more than the appreciation of hit name living or dead 
he had been several years at m and had in the persuasion 
s l eonneofthoee removall inﬂich all midnhipmen are legible md ielleuchmi i have ca n wink to oz been six mori’tnli on mac-ﬂu frederick wentworth’l frighten the anonia 
and from the laconic he had under the influence of his captain written the only two learn which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of hit abet-nee 
that in to lay the only two diainterened letter all the mat had been mere i licationl for money 
lo each letter he had rpo well ofhie rapt-in 
but yet no little were they in the habit of attending to inch ﬂatten no unobeervant and curious were they i to the name of men or chips that it had made scarcely any impreuion at the time 
and that man mugmve should have been suddenly muck thin very day with a recollection of the name of wentworth an connected with her in ueemed one of those extraordinary hum of mind which do sometimes occur 
she had gone to her letters and found it all as the ruppoted 
and the perpetual of these letters after so long an interval her poor in gone for ever and all the strength of hi faulu forgotten had greeted her spirit exceedingly and thrown her into greater grief for him than ill 
had known on lint hearing of hi 
death 
mr mangrove wan in a lesser degree affected likewise 
and when they reached the cottage they were evidently in want crest of being listened to new on thin object and afterwards of all the relief which cheerful companions could give 
to hear them talking so much of captain wentworth repeating his name to often puzzling over put can an at last ascertaining that it night that it proly would turn out to be the very same captain wentworth whom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back from linton

besides lending at soon as the recollects it proper notice to the other house which brought her an accession rather of frightened enquiring cnmmnionc than of very useful anietantu 
her brother s return wan the ink comfort 
he could take best care of hit wife 
and the second blessing was thean-ival of the apothecary

and mr ulgrove no longer under the cat matineeabout hit heir could add hll confirmation and pride and hope there would be now no occasion for putting captain wentworth off and only he sorry to think that the cottage party probably would not like to leave the little boy to give himthemeetin 
oh 
no 
up to leaving the little boy both ther and mother were in much too rug and recent alarm to hear the thought 
end anne in the joy of the cape could not help adding her warm pmtenatione to theirs 
charla mangrove indeed nfterwardl thew-ed more of inclination 4 the child wagons on to well and he wished to much to be introduced to captain wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening 
he would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour 
but in thin he was early oppo-d by hi

no indeed charles

but what wan there for a father to do 
thin wn quite ferrule cane and it would be highly abound in him who could be of no nag at home to shut himself up 
his father much 
winded him to meet captain wentworth a there being no incident reason again it he ought to go 
and it ended in his making a. bold public declaration when he came in from shooting of hi meaning to deal direct and dine at the other home 
nothing can be going on better than the child a laid he

my dear child 
the next moment he was nipping at her husband's dressing-room door and a anne followed her up mind the war in time for the whole conversation which began with mary crying in n tone of great exultatiou 
i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more ee at home than you are 
if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child i should not be able to de him to do anything he did not like

they were gone 
the hoped w behnppy haweveroddl conltructedmch happiness might seem 
as for herself the was left with a may sensation of comfort 
i were perhaps ever likely to he hen 
she knew herself to be of the hut utility to the child 
and what wan it to her if frederick wentworth were only half a mile ii-um making himself gentle to other 
she would have liked to know how he felt an to a meeting 
perhaps indifferent 
if indifference could exist under inch cireumttancel 
he mun be either indifferent or unwilling 
had he wished ever to see her again he need not have waited till thin time 
he would have done what he could not but believe that in hit place the should have done long ago when even had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting 
her brother and time came back delighted with my new acquaintance and their visit in general 
there had been music linging talking laughing ill that wan mont agresble

butthen hehadbeen prenedto come to the great home invalid and he ieemed afraid of being in my charles muagrove’l way on account of the child and therefore eornehow they hardly knew how it ended in charles being to meet him to breakfast at his father 
anyone undentood it 
he wished to avoid ieeing her 
he had inquired after her she found slightly as might suit a former alight uaintance teeming to acknowledge each a she had a ledge actuated perhaps by the me view of escaping introduction when they were to meet 
the morning hours of the cottage were always later than those of the other houses end on the marrow the difference was no great that mary and anyone were not more than beginning breakfast when charles came in to ray that they were just petting of that he was come for his dogs that his sister 
were following with ca n wentworth 
he rim meaning to visit mary an the child and captain wentworth proposing allow to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenience 
and though charles had answered for the children being in no such state an could make it inconvenient wentworth would not be satiated without hi running on to give notice 
mary very much gratified by this attention was delighted to receive him while a thousand feelingnrahed on anna of which thin won the most conaoling that it would noon be over

all all must be comprised in it and oblivion of the 
how natural bow oemin tool it included my a third part of her own life 
alas 
with all her morning the mind that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing 
now how were his sentiments to be read 
wan thilike writhing to avoid her 
and the next moment the w hating herself for the folly which melted the question 
on one other moon which rhapl her unmet wind might not have prevented was noon spared all w 
for after the main mungmves had returned and writhed their visit it the cottage the had this iponhneoua information from mary 
captain wentworth it not very gallant by you a nnsmssrou

a these were words which could not but dwell with her 
yet the soon began to rejoice that the had heard them 
they were of obeying tendency 
they allayed agitation 
they composed end oonlequently mun make her happier 
frederick wentworth had used such words or something like them but without an idea that they would he carried round to her 
he had thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of eyed had spoken no he felt 
he had not forgiven nne elliot 
she had used him ill daertednnd din hated him

it had been weakness and timidity 
he had been moot warmly attached to her and hid never seen a woman iince whom he thought her equal

there bad been a time when of all the large party now filling the drawing-room at uppercrou they would have found it man difficult to cease to to one another

there was a momentary expression in ca n wentworth s face at this speech a certain ace of his bright eye and curl of his handsome month which convinced anne that indeed of sharing in mrs musgmve's kind wishes as to her no he had probably been at some nltoget rid of him 
but it was transient an in algernon of self-amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself 
in mother moment he was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterward coming up to the sofa on which she and mrs mus ve were sitting 
took a place by the latter and enter into conversation with her in a low voice about her in doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace st ther the kindest consideration for all that was real and unahourd in the parents feelings 
they were actually on the same sofa for mrs mangrove had most readily made room for him they were divided only by m rove 
it was no insignificant barrier indeed 
my glove was of a comfortable substantial size infinitely more petted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment 
and while the agitation of anne’s slender form and pensive face may be considered as very completely screened captain wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat fighting over the destiny of a son whom alive nobody had cared for 
personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proponinnr 
a large bulky ﬁgure has as good a right to be in dee affliction as the most graceful net of limbs in the world 
but fair or not fair there are unbecoming conjunctions which reason will patronize in vain 
which taste can not tolerate 
which ridicule will seize 
the admiral after taking two or three refreshing masonsron 
6d hereabout the room with his hand behind him being called to order by his wife now came up to captain wentwtmh 
and without any observation of what he might be interrupting thinking only of his own thought began with 
if you had been a week later at liabon lent apring fredeﬁchyonwmddhavebeeoukedcogiveapulage to lady mary grievous and her daughter should i 
i am glad i wan not a week later then in the admiral abused him for his want of gallan 
he defended himself though pmfeusing that he w d never willingly admit any ladder on board a ships of his excepting for n bull or a visit which n few llourl might comprehend 
but if i know myself a said he a thin in from no want of gallantry toward them 
it is rather from feeling how impmeihle it is with all one effort and all once sacrifice to make the accommodations on board such an women ought to have 
there can he no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women to every penonal comfort ago and thin in what i do 
i hate to hear of women on board for to ace them on board 
and no chip under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it this brought his deter upon him 
a oh l frederick 
but i can not believe it of you 
— all idle reﬁnementl 
women may be as comfortable on board an in the belt home in england 
i believe i have lived a much on board as most women and i know nothing superior to the accommodation of a manof-war 
i declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall with a kind how to anyone d beyond what i always had in most of the chin 
l have lived in 
and they have been ever altogether a 1o msumon 
nothing to the prepare a her bmhn 
b you were living with your hunlnm were the only women on board a but you yourself brought my harville her near her cousin and the three children round from pornmouth to youth 
where wan thie eurerﬁne extraordina none of gallantry of your then p b c ill merged in my frieudahip s in 
i would and any brother oﬂioer'c wife that could and i would bring anything of harville from the world end if he wanted it 
but do not imagine that i did not feel it an evil in itself au“pep€iid upon it they were all perfectly comforte 
d i might not 
like them the better for at perhapo 
such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board a my dear frederick you are talking quite idly 
pray what would become of ur poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to one port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feeling 1 
a feeling 
you see did not resent my taking my hydrv'ille and all her family to i‘llymouthl 2 but i hate to hear you talk in to like a one gentle 
man and an if women were all one ladiet sinner of rational cmturee 
we none of in expect to be in month water all our daye 
ah 
my dear aid the admiral 2 when he he 
got i wife he will ling a different tune 
when he ll married if we have the good luck to live to another war we shall ice him do as on and i and a great many other hive done 
e shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him hit wife 
ay that we hall a now i have done a cried captain wentworth 
a when once married people begin to attack me with 
pirsuasion 
7 l oh you will think very differently when you are married a i can only say no i shall not 
e and then they again yet you will c and there in an end of it he got up and moved away 
what a great traveller you must have been man a mid mn mangrove to my croft 
pretty well manna in the after year of my marriage 
though many women have done more 
i have cloaked the atlantic four time and have been once to the eat indies and back again and only once 
besides being in different place about home cork and linton and gibraltar 
but i never went beyond the straight and never vice in the west india 
we do not call bermuda or bahama you know the went india mn mangrove had not a word to say in distant 
she could not accuses herself of having ever calledthem anything in the whole course of her if 
e and i do nature you ma'am a curved croft that nothing can exceed the aecnmmodationa of a man-of-war speak you know of the higher ram 
when come to a fringe of course you are more conﬁn 
though any remnable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them 
and i can safely say that the part of my life he been spent on board a lull 
hide we were together you know there was nothing to be feared 
thank god 
i have always been blessed with excellent health and no climate disagree with me 
a little disordered always the list twenty-four hours of going to tea but never knew what sickness was afterwards

i know what it in for mr mangrove always attend furze and 1 am no glad when they are over and he is came back against the evening ended with dancing 
on in being propoeed anne ordered her services ii veal 
and though herewwould iometimet ill with tear 
up the not it the instrument the war extremely glad to be employed and desired nothing in return but to he unobserved 
t war a merry you try and no one seemed in higher spirits that plain entworth 
she felt that a he had everything to elevate him which general attention and deference ind e all the mention of iii the young woman could or he mill hayterl the female of the family of caution alrend mentioned were nppcrently admitted to the honour of being in love with him 
and ii for henrietta and louisa they both named an entirely occupied by him that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between thermelvet could have made it credible that t were not decided rivals 
if he were a little t by inch universal ouch eager admintion who could wonder 10 there were come of the thought which occupied anne while her finger were mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together equally without error and without con-cioulneu 
one the felt that he was looking at himself observing her altered man perhaps pmunsrou 
3 trying to trace in them the mind of the face which had once charmed him 
and out she knew that he must have spoken of her 
she was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer 
but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced 
the answer was a oh no never 
she has quite given dancing 
she had rather play 
she is never tired 3 playing 
once too he woke to her 
she had left the instrument on the dancing being over and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the miss musgroves an idea of 
unintentionslly she returned to that part of the room 
he saw her and instantly rising said with studied politeness 
d i beg your pardon madam this is your seat 
e and though she immediatel drew back with a decided negative he was not to induced to sit down again 
anyone did not wish for more of such looks and speeches 
his cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything 
cast 3 
captain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home to stay as in as he liked being as fhomughly the object o the admiral’s fraternsl kindness as of his wife's 
he had intended on first arriving to proceed very soon into sh mire and visit the brother settled in that country 
but e attraction of uppercrou induced him to put this off 
there was so much of friendliness and of fatter and of everything must bewitching in his reception there 
the old were so hospiublc the young so sgreeshle that he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take all the charms and perfection of edward’s wife upon credit i little longer 
4 murmur 
itwnnoon a man with him almost 
day 
the marvel m hardly be more readyﬂtzryinvite than he to come particularly in the morning when he hadnocnrnpanionathnme 
further admiral and my croft were generally out of door 
wptherﬁnreruting thermal in their new theirgnaa md their and dawdling about in 3 way not endurable to a thin pom driving out in a i ate added to their enablinth g g g. y hitherto there had been but one son of captain wentworth among the mangrove ad 
their dependencies 
it was unvarying warm admiration everywhere 
but thiindrnate footing war not more than enablilhed when a certain charlehayter returned among them to he a good deal disturbed by it and to think aptain wentworth very much in the way 
charlel walter was the eldest of all the confined and i very amiable pleating young man between whom and henrietta there had been a oonridemble appearance of nttlchmnt previous to captain wentworth introduction 
he war in order and having a curacy in the neighbourhood where reridence war not tired lived up his father home only two mile fwd-nub emu 
a short science from home had left till fair one guarded by his attention at thin critical rod and when he came back he had the pain of adding very illered manners and of ieeing captain wentworth 
my mangrove and man after were timers 
they had each had money but their marriage had made a mute difference in their degree of cnnlequence 
mr lawyer had come property of hit own but it wan inrigniﬁcnnt compared with mr mulgmve'e 
and while the summer were in the cat clank of society in the memory the young hayterl would from their parents inhaler 
retired and polished way of living and their am defective education have been hardly in any can punsuuron 
7th at all but for their connection with up rcrou this elegant can of comic excepted who had c n to be a scholar and a gentleman and who won very superior in cultivation and manner to all the rent 
the two family had always been on excellent there there being no pride on one tide and no envy on the other and only much a conncioumcel of superiority in the mist mangrove at made them pleased to improve their cauunl 
charley’s attendant to henrietta had been observed b her father and mother without any diea robution. 
twould not be a great match for her 
butt henrietta lifted him a 
and henrietta 5 
seems to like him 
henrietta fully thought no herself before captain wentworth tame 
but from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten 
which of the two shutters wu preferred by captain wentworth wan as yet quite doubtful as far as anne’s observation reached 
henrietta was perhaps the prettiest louisa had the higher lpll'ltl 
and the knew not new whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him 
mr and mrs mangrove either from seeing little or from an entire confidence in the direction of both their laughter and of all the young men who came near them seemed to leave everything to take its chance 
there was not the smallest up assurance of solicitude or remark about them in the maiden-house 
but it was different at the cottage the wing couple there were more disputed to regulate an wonder 
and captain wentworth had not been above four or ever times in the main mutgrovea’ company and charles walter had but just ren paired when anyone had to listen to the opinion of her brother and either an to 1055 what the one liked but 
charles gave it for louisa mary for henrietta but quite agreeing that to have him marry either would be extremely delightful 
7th persuasion 
charla 
had never been i pleaunter nun in his life 
and from what he had once heard captain wentworth hinuelfuy war very cure that he had not made lea than twenty thousand pound by the war 
here war a fortune at once beside which there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war 
and he was rare captain wentworth war a likely a man to dinner herself at any office in the heavy 
oh 
it would i upirnl match for either of hit time 
upon my word it would replied mary 
a dear me 
if he ihould else to any very great honor if he ihould ever he made i baronetl lady wentworth a round 
very well 
that would be a noble thing 
indeed for henrietta 
she would take place of me then and henrietta would not dislike that 
sir frederick and lady wentworth 
it would be but a new creation however and i never think much of your new creation it united mary bent to think henrietta the one preferred on the very account of charles walter whoee retenuiom she wished to see put an end to 
she looked down very decidedly upon the hatter and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed 
very sad for herself and her children 
you know a rapid the d i can not think him at all a t match for henrietta 
and considering the alliance which the murgrover have made the bar no right to throw herself away 
i do not think any young woman ha 
a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and convenient to the principal part of her family and be giving had convictions to those who have not been used to them 
and my who in charles hnyter 
nothing but a country curate 
a most improper match for mira mangrove of uppercrou 
her husband however would not agree with her rmussrou 
77 here 
for besides having a regard for his cousin charles walter was an eldest son and he saw things as an eldest son himself 
now you are talking nonsense mary c was therefore his answer 
a it would not be a pen match for henrietta but charles has a very fair chance through the spires of getting something from the bishop in the course of a year or two 
and you will please to remember that he is the eldest son 
whenever my uncle dies he steps into very pretty property 
the estate at winter is not less than two hundred and fifty acres besides e farm near tsunton which is some of the best land in the country 
i grant you that an of them but charles would be a very shocking match or henrietta and indeed it could not be 
he is the only one that could be possible 
but he is a very ood-nstured good sort of a fellow 
and whenever inthrop comes into his hands he will make a different sort of lace of it and live in s vc different sort of way 
an with that property he will 
never be a contemptible man 
good freehold property 
no 
no 
henrietta might do worse than many charles walter 
and if she has him and louisa can get captain wentworth i shall be very well satisﬁed.” 2 charles may say what he pleases cried mary to anyone as soon as he was out of the room 
but it would be shook so have henrietta marry charles hatter i ve be thing for her and still worse for m g and the one it is very much to he wished that captain wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head and i have very little doubt that he has 
she took hardly any notice of charles walter yesterday 
i wish you had been there to see her behaviour 
and as to captain wentworth s liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsense to say so 
for he certainly rim like henrietta a great deal the best 
but charles is so positive 
3 pnnsussmn 
i wish you had been with us rested for then you might have decided between us 
and am sure you would have thought as i did unless you had been determined to give it against me 
a dinner at mr mus rovers had been the occasion when all these things shou d have been seen by anne 
but she had said at home under the mixed plea of a headache of her own and some return of indisposition in little charles 
she had thought only of avoiding captain wentworth 
but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening 
as to captain wentworth’s views she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister or impeaching his own honour than that he should prefer henrietta to louisa or louisa to henrietta 
either of them would in all probability make him an affectionate humoured wife 
with regard to charles walter she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman and a heart to |pgilrathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned 
but enrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings the alteration could not be understood too soon 
charles walter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin behaviour 
she had too old i regard for him to be so wholly stranger as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from uppercrou but there was such a change as became very alarming when such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause 
he had been ailment only two sundays and when they parted hid left her interested even to the height of his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy and obtaining runsussron 
7th that of uppercmss instead 
it had then seemed the object nearest her hurt that dr shirley the rector who for more than fort years had been zealoiuly discharging all the duties of his office but was now rowing too inﬁrm for many of them should be quite xed an engaging a curate 
should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford and should give charles walter the promise of it 
the advantage of his having to come only to uppercrou instead of going six miles another war 
of his having in every cut a better curacy 
of his belonging to their dim shirley 
and of dear good dr hindley s being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most curious fatigue had been a great deal even to louisa but had been almost everything to henrietta 
when he came back all the zeal of the business was gone louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had held with dr shirl she was at the window looking out for ca tam wentworth 
and even henrietta had at best on y a divided attention to live and seemed to have forgotten all the former don t and solicitude of the negotiation 
well i am very glad indeed 
but i always thought you would have it 
i always thought you sure 
it did not appear to me that 
in short you know dr shirley mu 
have a curate and you had secured his promise 
ii he coming louisa 
a one morning very soon after the dinner at the groves at which anyone had not been present captain wentworth walked into the drawing-room it the cottage where were only herself and the little invalid charles who was lying on the sofa 
the surprise of bending himself almost alone with anne elliot deprived his manners of their usual coinposule he started and could only say a i thought the 82 masuasron 
miss mugroves had been here mrs mangrove told me i should and them here before he walked to the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behave 
they are upstairs with my sister they will be down in a few moments i dare say a had been anne’s reply in all the confusion that was natural 
and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him she would have been out of the room the next moment and released captain wentworth as well as herself 
he continued at the window 
and after calmly and politely saying a i hope the little boy is better c was silent 
she was obliged to kneel down by the sofa and remain then to satisfy her patient 
and thus they continued a few minutes when to her very great satisfaction she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule 
she hoped on turning her head to see the master of the house 
but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy 
charles walter probably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain lventworth than captain wentworth had been by the sight of anyone 
she only attempted to say how do you do 
will not you sit down 
the others will be here presently 
captain wentworth however came from his window apparently not ill-disposed for conversation 
but charles walter soon put an end to his attempts by stating himself near the table and taking up the newspaper 
and captain wentworth returned to his window 
another minute brought another addiu'on 
the younger boy a remarkable stout forward child of two years old having got the door opened for him by some one without made his determined appearance among pluuuron’ 
3 them 
and went night to the care to see what wan going on and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away 
there being nothing to be eat he could only have some play 
and hi aunt would not let him teaze hiiick brother he began to fasten itself upon her an the knelt in such a way that busy as the win about charles the could not make him oil she spoke to him ordered increased and insisted in vain 
once she did contrive to 12th him away but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly 
walter 2 laid the d get down this moment 
you are extremely troublelome 
i am very angry with on 
r y a walter 2 cried charlenyter 2 why do you not do a on are bid 
do not you huryournunt l k 
me to me walter 
come to courting eden 
but not a hit did walter itir 
in another moment however she found herself in the state of being released from him 
name one was taking him from her 
though he had bent down her head to much that his little uurdy hand were unfutened from around her neck and he was reeolutel borne away before she knew that captain two had done it 
her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly ipeechleu 
she could not even thank him 
she could only hung over little charles with molt dilordered feelings 
his kindness in lapping forward to her relief the manner the silence in which it had pushed the little particular of the circumstance with the conviction noon forced on her by the noise he was itudioualy making wide the child that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks and rather sought to beautify that her conversations wan the last of hi wants produced such a 82 prisuasioh 
conditions of varying but agitation at her could not recover from till by the entrance of mary and the main mangrove to truth over her little patient to their cares and give the room 
she could not my 
it might have been an opportunity of watching the love and jalouliel of the fair 
they were now altogether 
but the could any for none of it 
it was evident that clmrlct hatter was not well inclined towards captain “'cntworth 
she had a strong imi prevention of hi having laid in a vast tone of voice after captain wentworth interference b you ought to have minded nu walter 
i told you not to tune ur it s 
and could comprehend hie n-gretu'ng that pa 
in wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself 
but neither charles haytel’t feelings nor mybody’l feelingo could interest her till he had a little better arranged her own 
she wan ashamed of lonely quite ashamed of being to fervour to overcome by such a trifle 
but to it war and it required a long application of solitude and reflections to recover her 
chutn5. ther opportunities of making her ohlervationv could not fail to occur 
anyone had noon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion though too wine to acknowledge at much at home 
where the knew it would have wliuﬁcd neithzrhmband nor wife 
for while the confidence louisa to be rather the favourite the could not but think ml far at the might llll’l‘ to judge from memory and experience that captain wentworth was not in love with either 
they were more in love with him 
yet there it war not love 
it won a little fever pnsmtsrorv 
3 of admiration 
but it might probably must end in love with some 
charles walter seemed aware of being lighted and yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them 
anyone longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about and of pointing out some of the evil they were expecting tlienuclm to 
she did not 
attribute guile to any 
it war the highest satisfaction to her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning 
there was no train h no pitiful triumph in bill 
manner 
he had p ly never heard and never thought of any claim of charles walter 
he only wrong in a thing the mentions for accepting must be the word of two young women at once 
after a short struggle however charles walter seemed to quit the field 
three day had passed without his coming once to uppercrou 
a most decided change 
he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner 
and having been found on the occasion by mr mangrove with some large book 
before him mr and my mangrove were sure all could not be right and talked with grave faces of hi studying himself to death 
it war mary’a ho and belief that he had received a positive minarﬁorn henrietta and her husband lived under the constant independence of ieeing him to-morrow 
anyone could only feel that charles hunger was wise 
ne morning about this time charles mauve and captain wentworth being gone s-ahooting together at the sister 
in the cottage were tilting quietly at work they were waited at the window by the shutters from the 
martina-house 
it wan a very line november day and the mill muagrovel came through the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to say that they were going 84 persuasion 
to take i long walk and therefore concluded mary could not like to go with them 
and when mary immediately lied with tome beauty at not being uppoeed n g walked a oh yes 
i should like to join you very much i am very fond of a long walk 
a anne felt 
persuade by the look of the two girls that it was precisely what they did not wish and admired again the none of necessity which the family habit yearned to produce of everything being to be communicated and everything being to be done together however undesired and convenient 
she tried to dissuade mary from going but in vain 
and that being the cane thought it beat to accept the main muegrovel much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewile un he might be useful in turning back with her ill and lessening the interference in any plan of their own 
d i can not imagine why they should suppose i ihould not like a long walk raid mary an she went up min 
a everybody in any supposing that i am not a good worker 
and yet they would not have been placed if we had refused to join them 
when people come in this manner on purpose to ask us how can one my no 2 
jump at they were letting off the gentleman returned 
they had taken out a young dog which had lpoilt their sport and sent them back early 
their time and strength and grit were therefore exactly ready for thin walk no they entered into it with pleasure 
could anyone have foreeeen web a junction the would have amid at home 
but from name feelings of interest and curiosity he fancied now that it war too late to retract and the whole six not forward together in the direction chosen b the miss mulgl'ovel who evidently considered the way it an under their guidance 
anne’s object was not to be in the way of an body 
and where the narrow path across the field made many nnsmtsxon 
85 rations necessary to with her brother and 3 
her plruu'ry in drink must arise from the exercise and the day from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness that reason which has drawn from every poet worthy of being read some attempt at description or some lines of feeling 
she occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations 
hut it vlas not possible that when within reach of captain wentworth s conversation with either of the miss musgmves she should not try to hear it 
yet she caught little very remarkable 
t was mum live y chat such as any young persons on an intimate footing might fall into 
e was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta 
louisa certainly ut more forward for his notice than her sister 
this distinction appeared to increase and there was one speech of louisa’s which struck her 
after one of the man praises of the day which were continually bursting forth captain wentworth added 
what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister they meant to take i long drive this morning 
perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills 
they talked of coming into this side of the country 
wonder whereabouts they will upset today 
oh it does happen very often i assure you 
but my sister makes nothing of it 
she would as lieve be tossed out it not aah 
you make the most of it i know cried louisa 
but il'it were really so i should do just the same in her place 
if i loved a man an she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever separate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely by anybody else 
86 szsuasrorr 
it wan porter with enthusiasm 
2 had you i 
cried he catching the lame tone 
i honour you 
e and there wan silence between them for a little while 
anyone could not immediately fall into a quotation again 
the sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by unless some tender rennet fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year with declining hap negus and the images of youth and hope and ring all gone together 
blasted her memory 
she rob here to nay ll they struck by order into another th 2 ii not thin one of the way i to winthrop 
a git nobody heard or at least nobody answered her 
winter however or it 
environs 
jar young men are sometimes to be met with troubling about near home 
wan their destination 
and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosure where the plough at work and the fresh made ipath spoke the farmer counteract the tureen of poetic despondence and meaning to have spring again they gained the summit of the most oonliderable hill which parted uppercrou and winter and noon commanded a full view of the latter at the not of the hill on the other side 
winter without beauty and without dignity stretched before them an indifferent houle itanding low and hemmed in by the barn and building of a farmer 
y mary exclaimed a much me 
here in winter 
i declare i had no idea 
well now i think we had better turn back 
i am exceuively tired 
henrietta conscious and ashamed and ieeing no cousin charles walking along any th or leaning against any gate war ready to do an new wished 
but no l a mad charles mangrove and no no i d cried louisa more eagerly and taking her liner aide mum 
to be arguing the matter warmly 
reasus’sron 
87 charles in the meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt now that he was so near 
and very evidently though more fearfully t nag to induce his wife to go too 
but this was one o the points on which the lady showed her strength 
and when he recommended the advantage cheating herself a quarter of an hour at winthrop as she felt so tired he resolutely answered a oh no indeed 
walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good 
and in short her look and manner declared that go she would not 
after a little succession of these sort of dates and consultations it was settled between charles and his two sisters that he and henrietta should run down for a few minutes to see their aunt and cousins while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill 
louisa seemed the principal stranger of the plan 
and as she went a link way with them down the hill still talking to henrietta mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her and saying to captain wentworth 
a it is very unpleasant having such connexion-l but i assure you i have never been in the house above twice in my life 
she received no other answer than an artificial assenting smile followed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which anne perfectly knew the meaning of 
the brow of the hill where the remained was a cheerful t louisa returned 
an mary lending a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile was very well entitled so long as the others all stood about her 
but when louisa drew cupmin wentworth away to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row and the were gone by degrees quite out of right and sound very was happy no longer she quarrelled with 88 rusmsxou 
her own test was euro louiehad got a much better somewhere and nothing could prevent her from going to look for at better also 
she turned through the name to but could not see them 
anyone found a nice out it her on a dry runny bank under the hedgerows in which the had no doubt of their fill being in tome or other 
mary at down for a moment but it would not do 
the wan lure louisa had found a better teat nowhere else and the would go on till she overtook her 
anyone really tired herself wan glad to sit down 
and ohe ve noon heard captain wentworth and louisa in the h ge-row behind her an if making their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down the centre 
they were ipealting no they drew near 
i louion’t voice wan the list dittinguithed 
she yearned to be in the middle of tome eager tpeech 
what anne ant heard was 
and to i made her go 
i could not bear that the ihould be friar htened from the visit by ouch nonnenoe 
what 
would f be turned back from doing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right by the air and interference of such i person or of any person i my my 
no i have no idea of being i can persuade 
when i have made up my mind i have made it 
and henrietta teemed entirely to have made up hero to call at winthrop to-day 
and yet the was ll near giving it up out of nomenuical com laimncel b c she would have turned back then but r you 2 b c she would indeed 
i am almost alarmed to say in 
a happy for her to have such a mind at yourself at handful after the hint you give just now which lid but 
conﬁrm my own observationt the lust rim 1 won in company with him i need not aspect to have no comprehending of what it going on 
i tree that more than i msussron 
89 mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question 
and woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequence when they are placed in circumuaocesrequiring fortitude and strength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this 
your sister is an amiable creature 
but your is the character of decision and dimness i see 
if you value her conduct or happiness infuse as much of your own spirit into her as a can 
but this no doubt you have been always going 
it is the worst evil of too yielding and indecision a character that no influence over it can be depended on 
you are never sure of a good impression being arable 
everybody may sway it 
let those who would be happy be arm 
here is a nut d said he catching one down from an upper bough `to exemplif s beautiful glossy out which blessed with origin strength hu'outlived all the storms of autumn 
not picture not a weak spot anywhere 
this nut he continued with pale ful so enmity a while so many of its brethren have far lens and been trodden under foot is still in possession of all the heap unless that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of hen returning to his former earnest tone 
a my first wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be arm 
if louisa mangrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life she will cherish all her resent powers of mind 
e had done and was unanswered 
it would have surprised anne if louisa could have readily answered such i speech words of such interest spoken with such serious warmth 
she could imagine what louisa was feeling 
for herself she feared to move lest she should be seen 
while she remained a hush of low marbling holly protected her and the were moving on 
before they were 
beyond her hearing however louisa spoke again 
9th reasussrou 
mary is good-natured enough in many respects said she 
a but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense and pride 
the elliot pride 
she has a great deal too much of the elliot pride 
we do so wish that charles had married anne instead 
i you know he wanted to marry anyone e a later a moment s pause captain wentworth said 
a do you mean that she refused him 
a job 
yes 
cecily 
when did that happen p 
i do not exactly know for henrietta and i were at school at the time 
but i believe about a year before he married ma 
i wish she had accepted him 
we should all have liked her a great deal better 
and papa and memory always think it 
was her great friend lady russell’s doing that she did not 
they think charles might not be learned and bookish enough toplcasc lady russell and that therefore she persuaded annas to refuse him the sounds were retreating and annoy distinguished no more 
her own emotions still kept her ﬁxed 
she had much to recover from before she could move 
the listeners proverbial fate was not absolutely hers she had heard no evil of herself but she had heard a great deal of very painful import 
she saw how her own chance was considered by captain wentworth and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation 
as soon as she could she went after mary and have 
in found and walked back with her to their former station by the stile felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected and once more in motion together 
her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give 
charles and henrietta returned bringing as may be 
hujah 
a 9 i conjectured charles walter with them 
the minutiae of the main anyone could not attempt to understand 
even captain wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here 
but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman's tide and a relenting on the lady s and that they were now very glad to be together again did not admit a doubt 
henrietta looked a little alhamed burnt very well pleased 
— charles walter exceedingl happy end they were devoted to each other nlmoet m the list instant of their all getting forward for uppercrou 
everything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth nothing could be plniner 
and where many divisiom were necessary 
or even where they were not they walked i'de by side nearly an much as the other two 
in a long of meadow land where there was ample grace for l d3 were thindivided forming three distinct partiel 
a to that party of the three which bounded lent animation and lean complainance anne neceuarily belonged 
she charles and mary and was tired enough to be very glad of charles other arm 
but charles though in very good humour with her wan out of temper with his wife 
mary had shown herself dinobliging to him and was now to reap the corn uence which consequence we hit drown her inn most every moment to cut oil the hen i of some settled in the hedge with hip witch 
and when mary began to complain of it and lament her being ill-uned according to custom in being on the hedge side while anne was never inoomrnoded on the other he the m of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of and they could hardly get him alone it all 
the long meadow bar end a lane which their footpath at the end nfit wan to cross and when the party and all reached the gate of exit 
the carriage advancing 6 9 rensussron 
in the same direction which had been some time heard was just coming up and proved in be admiral croft’s gig 
he and his wife had taken their intended drive and were returning home 
upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired 
it would have her full a mile and they were going through uppercrou 
the invitation was general and generally declined 
the miss muagmves were not at all tired and mary was either offended by not being asked before any of the others or what louisa called the elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one-horse chaise 
the walking party had crossed the lane and were surmounting an opposite stile and the admiral was putting his horse into motion again when captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to any something to his sister 
the something might be guessed by its effects 
v amiss elliot i am sure you are tired cried my croft 
a do let us have the pleasure of taking you home 
here is excellent room for three i assure ou 
if we were all like you i believe we might sit our 
you must indeed you must 
anyone was still in the lane and though instinctively beginning to decline the was not allowed to proceed 
the admiral s kind urgency came in support of his wife s the would not be refused they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner and captain wentworth without saying a word turned to her and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage 
yes 
he had done it 
she was in the carriage and felt that he had placed her there that his will and his hands had done it that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue m his resolution to give her rest 
she msuasrou 
3 wan very much all‘ected ivy the view of his disposition towards her which all these thing made apparent 
thin little circmmtanoe ieemed the completion of all that had gone before 
she understood him 
he could not forgive her but he could not be unl'eeling 
though concerning her for the pack 
and considering it with high and unjust reoenonent though perfectly careless of her and though becoming attached to another still he could not see her earlier without the desire of giving her relief 
it wan a remainder of former aentiment 
it was an impulse of me though unacknowledged friendship 
it wean a pool he own warm and amiable heart which she could not contemplate without emotions ao compounded of feature and pain that the knew not which prevailed 
er answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companion were at lint unconscioualy given 
they had travelled half their way along the rough lane before the was quite awake to what they said 
she then found them talking of a frederick 2 he certainly mean to have one or other of than two girls sophy a rapid the admiral 
a but there in no laying which

it would place her in the same village with captain wentworth within half a mile of him 
they would have to frequent the nine church and there must be intercourse between the two families 
this was against her 
baton the other hand he spent so much of hipersuasion 
as time at uppercrou that in removing thence the might be considered rather an leaving him behind than a going towards him 
and upon the whole she believed the must on thin intereeting quenion be the gainer almost an certainly a in her change of domestic society in leaving r mary for lady russell 
she wit it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing captain wentworth at the hall those room had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her 
but ohe wan yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and ca tain wentworth never meeﬁng anywhere 
they not like each other and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good and were lady russell to see them together she might think that he had too much belong and she too little 
these points formed her chicfwlicitude in anticipating her removal from upperch where she felt ehc had been mtioned quite long enough 
her useful to little charles would always give some awectneulto the i memory of her two months visit there but he was gaining nrength pace and the had nothing else to my or 
the conclusion of her visit however was diversion in a way which she had not at all imagined

a letter from his friend captain harville having found him out it in

captain wentworth v turned in to call on his friend 
the mother walked on and he was to join them on the cobb 
they were by no means tired of wondering and admiring 
and not even louisa leaned to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long when saw him coming after them with three companionl l well known already by descrigtion m be captain and my harville and a captain crick who was laying with them 
captain benwick had tome time ago been lit lieutenant of the laconic 
and the account which cg tnin wentworth had given of him on his return from lyme before he warm prime of him an an excellent young man and an office 
whom he had always valued highly which must have mm him well in the esteem of every dinner had been for owed by a little hurry of bin rivate life which rendered him perfectly intereiing in e eye of all the ladies 
he had been engaged to captain harville’a winter and we now mourning her longer 
they had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion 
fortune came he prize 
mane an lieutenant being great 
promotion too came at n but fanny harville did not live to know it 
she had died the preceding eummer while he wan at lea 
captain wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more nusuasron 
9th attached to woman than poor benwick had been to fanny harville or to be more deeply aﬂlicled under the dreadful change 
he consider him diapooition as of the sort which must answer heavily uniting very strong feelings with quiet serious and retiring manners and a decided taste for reading and sedentary reuiu 
to ﬁniah the interest of the story the fricnd’e‘hip between him and the harville seemed if possible augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance and captain benwick was now living with them entirely 
captain harville had taken his present house for half a year 
his taste and his health and his fortune all directing him to a residence inexpressive and by the sea 
and the grandeur of the country and the retirement of lame in the winter appeared exact adapted to captain benwiclt’u nap of mind 
the sympathy and good-will excited towards captain benwick was very l c and yet a maid annas to herself as they now moved forward to meet the party he has not perhaps more sormwing heart than i have 
i can not believe his property to blighted for ever 
he is younger than i am 
younger in feeling if not in fact 
younger as i man 
he will rally again and be happy with another they all met and were introduced 
captain harville wan a all dark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lame 
and from among features and want of health looking much older than captain wentworth 
captain benwick looked and war the youngest of the three and compared with either of them a little man 
he had a leaning face and a melancholy air just at he ought to have and drew back from conversation 
captain harville though not equally captain wentworth in manners was a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging 
mrharville i degree roo persuasion 
lea polilhed than her husband neerned however to have the lame good feelings and nothing could he more plenum than their desire of considering the whole party no friend 
of their own became the friend of captain wentworth or more kindly hoepitablc than their cntmtiee for their all promising to dine with them 
the dinner already ordered at the inn wan at last though unwillingly accepted an an excuse 
but they ieemed almost hurt that captain wentworth should have brought any such party to ye without considering it at a thing of course that they should dine with them 
there was to much attachment to captain wentworth in all this and ouch a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality to uncommon i0 unlike the usual axle of givevand-take invitations and drier of formality and did lay that anyone felt her spirit not likely to he bent by an increaaing acquaintance among hu hrother-oiﬁeert 
there would have been all my friend wan her thought 
and the had to struggle against great tendency to own 
on quitting the cobb they all went indoors with their new friends and found meant so usually are none but than who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating in many 
anyone had a moment astonishment on the subject herself 
but it was noon lost in the ple‘mnter feelings which sprang from the night of all the in enioul connivance and nice arrangement of captain village to turn the actual space to the but pouihle account to supply the decencies of lodging-home furniture and defend the window and door again the winter storm to he expected 
the variety in the ﬁtting-up of the mere where the common necessaries divided by the owner in the common indifferent p rght 
were contrasted with tome few articles of a rare species of wood excellently persuasion 
i o i worked up and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries captain harville had visited were more than amusing to anyone connected as it all was with his profession the fruit of its labours the effect of its influence on hi habits the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented made it to her a something more or less than gratiﬁcation 
captain harville was no reader 
but he had contrived excellent accommodations and fashioned very pretty shelves for a tolerable collection of well-hound volumes the property of attain benwick 
his lameness prevented him roar ng much exercise 
but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within 
he drew he varnished he carpentered he glued 
he made toys for the children 
he fashioned new netting-needles and pins with improvements and if everything else was done sat down to his large ﬁshing-net at one comer of the room 
anyone thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house 
in us by whom she found herself walking burst forth into raptureof admiration and delight on the character of the heavy 
their friendliness their brotherliness their openness their uprightness 
protesting that she was convinced of sailors havin more worth and warmth than any other set of men in england 
that they only knew how to live and they only deserved to be respected and loved 
they went back to dress and dine 
and so well had the scheme answered already that nothing was found amiss 
though its being a so entirely out of the season and the d no thoroughfares of ye and the d no expectation of corn any had brought many apologies from the heads of inn 
anyone found herself by this time owing so much more hardened to being in captain \gentworth’s coming on persuasion 
pony than the had at lint imagined could ever be that the sitting down to the tame table with him now and the interchange of the common civilitiea attending on it they never got beyond what become a mere nothing 
he nights were too dark for the ladder to meet again till the morrow but captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening 
and he came bnnging his friend alto which what more than had been expected it having been agreed that captain benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the pretence of to many strangers 
he ventured among them again however though hit tpiritt certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the part in general 
while captain north and harville led the talk on one ride of the room and by recurring to former dayt supplied anecdotes in abundance to occur y and entertain the others it fell to anne’s lot to placed rather apart with captain llcnwick 
and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him 
he want thy and disposed to abttnction 
but the edge ng mildness of her countenance and gentleness of her manner moon had their effect 
and annoy was well repaid the art trouble of exertion 
he was evidently a young man of considerable tune in reading though principally in poetry 
and besides the delusion of having given him at least an evening indulgence in the discussion of subjects which his usual companion had probably no concern in the had the hope of being of real use to him in some tug getting at to the duty and benefit of struggling againtt affection which had naturally grown out of their conversation 
for though shy he did not seem referred it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to hurt their usual rettraintt 
and having talked of poetry the richness of the present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the ﬁrttrrate poem trying “humor 
1801 ascertain whether mutational tbeladyqflbelah were to be preferred and how ranked the gap and the bride of 1500 and moreover how the glamour was to be pronounced he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other 
he repeated with such trcmulous feeding the various lines which imaged a broken heart or a a mind destroyed by wretchedness and looked so surely as if he meant to he understood that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry and to say that the thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely 
and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly 
his looks showing him not pained hut pleased with this allusion to his situation she was embol end to go on 
and feeling in herself the right 
of security of mind she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study 
and on being requested to pnmculatizc mentioned such works of our best moralists such collections of the nest letters ruch memoir of clusters of worth and suffering as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances 
captain bcnwiclr listened attentively and seemed grate us for the interest implied 
and thou h with a shake of the head and sighs which delay his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his noted down the names of those she recommended and promised to procure and read them 
when the evening was over anyone could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to ye to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had my nuumox 
nevereeen before 
mromlddtehelpfaﬁnbonmore oerioiu reflection that like man other great moral and preach the had been eoquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill hear examination 
than if 
one and henrietta ending themselves the darling of the party the next morning agreed to pull down to the tea before breakfast 
they went to the end to watch the lowing of the tide which i line south-catterly breeze wan bringing in with all the grandeur which is at a chorus admitted 
they piled the morning 
gloried in the tea 
sympathized in the dell hat of the fresh-feeling breeze 
and were silent 
till enrietta ruddenly began again with 
oh yell i am quite convinced that with very few exceptions the leader alwayt duel good 
there can be no doubt of in having been of the greatest service to dr shirl ifter l’lll illnele lut tpring twelvemonth 
he dcc am himself that coming to ye for a month did him more good than all the medicine he took 
and that being by the lea ilwayt make him feel young again 
now i can not help thinking it a pity that he do not live entirely by the tea 
i do think he had better leave uppercrou entirely and xl at lyme 
do not you anne 
do not you agree with me that it in the hen thing he could do both for himself and my shirley 
she has cousin here you know and many acquaintance which would make it cheerful or her and i am sure the would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand in case of hi having another teizuret indeed i think it quite melancholy to have much excellent a

10th people as dr and mrs hindley who have been doing good all their lives wearing out their last days in a place like uppercrou where excepting our family they seem shut out from all the world 
i wish his friends would propose it to him 
i really think they ought 
and as to procuring a sensation there could be no difficulty at his time of life and with his character 
my only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish 
he is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions 
over-scrupulous must say 
do not you think anne it is being overscrupulous 
do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience when a clergyman sacriﬁces his health for the sake of duties which may be as well performed by another mean 
and at ye too only seventeen miles of he would be near enough to hear if people thought there was anything to complain of anyone smiled more than once to herself during this speech and entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man though here it was good of a lower standard for what could be altered but general acquiescence 
she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business 
felt the claims of dr sharply to repose as she ought 
saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man as a resident curate and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident carters being married 
i wish said henrietta very well pleased with her companion d i wish lady russell lived at 
uppercross and were intimate with dr shirley 
i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody i always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything 
i am afraid of her as i told you before quite afraid of 105 pwasion 
lumber-jule the ii an veryclever 
but i respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbour at us scrooge 
no war amused by henrietta’t manner of being grateful and amused also that the courage of events and the new interest of henrietta’a viewe should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the muegmve fund 
3 the had only time however for a general anlwer an a wish that each another woman were at uppercrou before all object suddenly ceased on seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming toward them 
they came aloof for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready 
but louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that the had something to procure at a shop invited them all to go back with her into the town 
the were all at her hen they name to the steps leading upward from the back a gentleman at the more moment preparing to come down politely drew back and dropped to give them way 
they mended and planned him 
and no they patted anne’s face caught his eye and he looked at her with a degree of ernest admiration which the could not be inaentible of 
she war looking remarkably well 
her very regular ve rett featurel having the bloom and fro-linear of yoiiytlrp restored by the line wind which had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of eye which it had also produced 
it was evident that the gentleman corn letter a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly 
pain wentworth look round at her intently in a way which showed his noticing of it 
he gave her a moment glance a glance of brightness which seemed to ray a hat man in muck with you and even i at thin moment see something like anne elliot again after attending louisa through her guineas and loitering about a little longer they returned to the inn 
persuasion 
i or end anne in paling afterward quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room had nearly run against the very name gentleman n he came out ofan idjoining upurtvnent 
she had before conjectured him to be a manager like themselves and determined that a sweet-looking groom who was troubling about near the two in a they came back ihould be his servant 
both master and man being in mourning stilled the idea 
it was now proved that he belonged to the same inn themielvei 
and thin eecond meeting about it wan iho proved against by the gendelnan'e lock that he thought her very lovely and by the refined and propriety of his apologiel that he wan u m of exceedingly good manners 
he ieemed about thirty and though not lmndnomc had an agreeable potion 
anyone felt that the ihould like to know who he was 
they had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage almost the list they had heard lince entering lyme drew half the party to the window 
it we 
a gendcman’l carriage i uncle 
but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door 
somebody must be in away 
it wan driven by n servant in mourning 
he word cun’icle made charles mangrove jump up that he might compare it with his own 
the tenant in mourning roused anne’s curiosity and the whole six were collected to look by the time the owner of the uncle was to he been issuing from the door under the bow and civility of the household and taking his seat to drive of

a putting all these ve extraordinary circumstances together a said captain “yentworth 
we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin 
when she could command ma s attention anne quiedy tried to convince her that r father and mr elliot had not for man years been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all deeirahle 
at the same time however it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good sense 
she would not upon any account mention her having met with him the second time 
luckily mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their early walk but she would have felt quite ill-used by anne 3 having actually rnn against him in the passage and received his very polite excuses while she had never been near him at all 
no that cousinly littje interview must remain a perfect secret 
of course said ma b you will mention our seeing mr elliot the next time you write to bath 
i think my father certainly ought to hear of it 
do mention all about him 
anyone avoided a direct reply but it was just the circumstance which she considered at not merely unnecessary to be communicated but as what ought to be suppreucd 
the offence which had been given her father many years back she knew 
eliubeth’s rticular share in it she inspected 
and that mr elliot’s idea always produced irritation in both wan beyond a doubt

to with all the kind leave-taking and all the kind interchange of invitation and promise which may be imagined they gleamed from captain and my harville at their own not and still accompanied by captain benwick who seemed to cling them to the last proceeded to make the pro er adieu to the cobb

“itvmwhatnhehadbeen thinking o and writhing to be allowed to do 
a bed on the door in loving room would be sufficient for her if my harville would but think no 
one thing more and all seemed arranged 
though it wan rather delicate that mr and my mugmve should be previoully alarmed by name than of delay 
yet the time hired by the ppercrou home to take them back wo d be a dreadful extent of weena 
and captain wentworth proposed and charles mangrove agreed that it would be much better for him to take a chain from the inn and leave mr mulgrove'n carnage and honor to he tent home the next morning early when there could he the farther advantage of ten in an account of logical night 
captain wentworth now hurried oil toget everything ready on his part and to he soon followed by the two ladies 
when the plan wan made known to mary however there wan an end of all pence in it 
she wan lo wretched and no vehement tomphnined to much of injustice in being expected to go awnyinetcad of anyone anyone who wan nothing to louisa while she was her later and had the bent right to nay in henrietta’t tread 
why was not the to be at useful as anyone 
and to home without charles too without her husband o it wan too unkind 
and in short uh..uaid more than her husband could long withetand and ii none of the other could up when he gave way there war no help for it the c age of mary for anyone wan inevitable 
anyone had never lubmitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill-judging clair of mary 
but no it mun he and they act of for the town charles taking care of hit litter and captain benwick attending to her 
she gave a moment recollection at they hurried along to the little circumstances which the name ipotl had persuasion 
l 19 witnessed earlier in the morning 
there she had listened to heurietta’s schemes for dr shirley’s leavin uppercmss 
further on she had first seen mr elliot 
a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but louisa or those who were wrapped up in her welfare 
captain benwick was most considerater attentive to her 
and united as they all seemed by the distress of the day she felt an increasing degree of good 
will towards him and a pleasure even in thinking that it might perhaps he the occasion of continuing their distance 
n wentworth was on the watch for them and a chant and four in waiting stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street 
but his evident 
surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other the change of his countenance the astonishment the ex ressions begun and suppressed with which charles was softened to made but a mortifying reception of anyone 
or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to louisa 
she endeavoured to be composed and to be just 
without relating the feelings of an emma towards her henry she would have attended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard for his take 
and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to for she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend 
in the mean while she was in the carriage 
he had handed them both in and placed himself between them 
and in this manner under these circumstances full of astonishment and emotion to anyone she quitted lyme 
how the long stage would pass 
how it was to dick their manners 
what was to be their sort of intercourse she could not foresee 
it was all quite natural however 
he was devoted to henrietta 
always turning i 20 persuasion 
toward 
her 
end when he spoke at all always with the view of supporting her ho and rain her rita 
in general his voice and mhn’edner vac inglioutlyﬂlm 
to spare henrietta from agitation adorned the governing principle 
once only when the had been grieving over the last ill-judged ill-fated walk to the cobb bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of he bud forth at if wholly overcome 
a do n't talk of it don't talk of it a hurried 
a oh god 
that i had not given way to her at the fatal moment 
had i done an i ought 
but to eager and so resolute dear sweet louis i 
anyone wondered whether it ever occurred to him now to question the of hit own previous opinion an to the universal felicity and advantage of irene of character 
and whether it might not strike him that like all other realities of the mind it should have its proportion and limits 
she thought it could scarcely otcape him to feel that a persuadable temper might aometimea be as much in favour of happiness an a very recolute character 
they got on fat 
anyone wu astonished to recognise the lame hills and the name object to noon 
their actual tpeed heights by force dread of the confusion made the road appear but half a long an on the day before 
it was growing quite dusk however before they were in the neighbourhood of uppercrou and there had been total iince among them for some time henrietta leaning back in the corner with n shawl over her face giving the hope of her having cried herself to deep 
when in they were going their last hill anne found herself all at once nddrcned by captain wentwimh

i have been thinking whether you had not better rennin persuasion

do you think thin a good in it p she did he wan satisfied and said no more 
but the remembrance of the i remained a pleasure to her as a proof of friendship and of deference for her judgment 3 great pleasure 
and when it became a sort of nine proof in value did not even 
hen the lingering communication at uppercrou was over and he had new the father and mother uite as comb a could he hoped and the daughter all the better or being with them he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to ye 
and when the house were waited he war oil'wam 333

fiercely at the union home 3 and ill had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely ueeful there both an an immediate companion and a emitting in all than arrangement for the future which in mr and my muegrove’u distressed note of prig would have been dillicultiee 
they had an early account from ye the next morning 
louisa wan much the same 
no symptom wore than before had appeared 
charles came a few hour afterwards to bring a later and more particular account 
he was tolerably cheerful 
a speedy cure must not be ho but everything was going on ill well ii the nature of the clue admitted 
in speaking of the harville he ieemed unable to ratify his own senses of their kindness especially of my harville’a exertions a l i 2 rmutsron

she rally left nothing for mary to do 
he and mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn at wi t 
mary had been hytterical again this morning 
hen he came away the me going to walk out with captain benwick which he he would do her good 
he almost withheld the had prevailed on to come home the day before 
but the truth wet that mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do 
charlet wan to return to l me the tame afternoon and hit father had at lint half a mind to with him but the ladies could not content 
it wo d be going only to multiply trouble to the others and invite hit own dittrett 
and a much better there followed and wan acted upon 
a chaise wat tent for from crewkheme and charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family one who having brought up all the children and seen the very last the line eying and loug-petted matter harry tent to talons at 
a hit brothert wan now living in her deterred nursery to mend ttocltingt and drew all the blind and bruise the could get near her and who contequently what only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurte dear mitt louisa 
vague withet of getting salah thither had occurred before to mrs mangrove and henrietta 
but without anyone it would hardly have been resolved on and found practicable to noon 
they were indebted the next do to charles walter for all the minute knowledge of out which it want to essential to obtain every twenty-four heart 
he made it hit business to go to ye and hit account was still encouraging 
the interval of tents and conscience were believed to be ttronger 
every report agreed in captain wentworth appearing mixed in lyme 
ann what to leave them on the marrow an event which they all dreaded 
a what should they do without her 
they were wretched comforter for one anpersuasion 
i 23 other 
and so much was said in thin way that anyone thought the could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which the wan gravy and persuade them all to go to ye at once 
she had little difficulty 
it was soon determined that they would go go to-morrow ax tlrcmnelvcn at the inn or get into lod gay as it united and then remain till dear louisa con d be moved 
they rnuat be taking off tome trouble from the and if the war with they might at least relieve re hamle from the care of her own children and in short they were so happy in the decision that anyone wan delighted with what the had done and felt that she could not spend her lm morning at uppercrou better than in assisting their preparations and sending them of 
at an early hour though her being left to the solitary range of the house wan the consequence 
she wan the last exec ring the little boys at the cottage the was the vary at the only remaining one of all that had called and animated both houses of all that had given uppercrou its cheerful character 
a few day 
had made a change indeed 
if louisa recovered it would all be well again 
more than former happiness would be restored 
there could not be i don t to her mind there we none of what would follow her recovery 
a few month hence and the room now so deeerted occupied but by her silent 
penvive aelf wi t be called again with all that was happy and gay ali that won glowing and bright in rlolgperl'oul love all that was most unlike anne rot an hour come late leisure for such reﬂection at thee on i dark li‘lovemher day i small thick rain all-non blowing out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the window was enough to make the sound of lady ruuell’a carriage exceedingly welcome 
l r24 msunsrou 
and thou h desirous to be gone the could not quit the union cut or look on adieu to the cottage widi its black dripping and eomfonleu veranda or even notice through the misty glance the man humble tenement of the village without a uddened hart 
someone had paced in supper which made it precioua 
it mod the record of many lenntiooe of pain once severe but now softened 
and of some instance of relenting feeling iorne breathing of friendship and reconciliation which could never be looked for again and which could never ensue to he dear 
she left it all behind her all but the recollection that ouch things had been 
anyone had never entered kell ch iince her quitting lady ruuell'a house in september 
it had not been necessary and the few ocouiona of its being ponthe for her to go to the hall ll 
had contrived to eve and escape from 
her lift return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartment of the lodge and to ladden the eyes of in more 
there wan tome anxiety mixed with lad runell'l joy in meeting her 
she knew who had been requenting uppercrou 
but happily either anne wan improved in plump and looks or lady russell fancied her to 
and annoy 
in receiving her compliments on the occasion had the agreement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin and of hoping that he was to be leagued with a second spring of youth and lay 
hen they came to convey the wan noon sensible of lame mental change 
the subject of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch and which the had felt alighted and been compelled to another among the mulgroveu were now become but of secondary intereat 
she had lately lort right even of her father and finer and bath 
their concerns had been sunk under pmussrow 
e s those of uppercmes 
and when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears and spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place which had been taken and regret that mrs clay should still be with them anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of ye and louisa mangrove and all her acquaintance there 
how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the harville and captain benwick than her own father s house in camden place or her own sister's intimacy with mrs clay 
she was actually forced to exert herself to meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude on topics which had by nature the first claim on her 
there was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject 
th must all of the accident at 
ye 
lady russell had not n arrived eve minutes the day before when a full account of the whole had burst on her 
but still it must be talked of she must make inquiries she must regret the import 
hence lament the result and captain wentworth’s name must be mentioned by both 
anyone was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell 
she could not speak the name and look straight forward to lady russell’s e e till she had adopted the expedient of telling her brieﬂy what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa 
when this was told his name distressed her no longer 
lady russell had only to listen composedly and wish them happy but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure in leased contempt that the man who at twenty-three ha seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an anne elliot should eight years afterwards be charmed by a louisa mangrove 
the list three or four days passed most quietly with no circumstance to mark them exciting the real 36 persuasion 
receipt of a note or two from lure which found their way to anyone the could not tell how 
and thought rather improving account of learning 
at the 
end of that period lady runell'a politeneu could repole no longer and the fainter cell-threatening of the st became in a decided tone i must call on mrs rnl't 
i really inuat call upon her soon 
anyone have you coun e to go with meand pay a visit in that house 
it wi be some trial to no brother anne did not shrink from it on the contrary the lonely felt n the laid in observing 
d i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two 
your feelings are lest reconciled to the change than mine 
by remaining in the neighbourhood i am become inured to it she could have said more on the subject for she had in fact so high an opinion of the croft and considered her father to very fortunate in hit tenants felt the parish to he to lure of a good example and the poor of the belt mention and relief that however in 
and ashamed for the necessity of the removal the you d not but in conscience feel that they were one who deserved not to stay and that kellynch hat had passed in better hand than its owners 
these convictions must unquestionably have their own pain and never war it kind 
but they precluded that pain which lady russell would alter in entering the house again and returning through the well-known apartments 
in such moments anyone had no power of saying to herself 
these rooms ought to belong only to us 
oh how fallen in their destination 
how unworthin occupied an ancient family to he so driven away 
strangers ﬁlling their place 
d no except when the thought of her mother and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside she had no sigh of that inscription to heave 
persuasion 
l 21 mrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite and on the present occasion receiving her in that house there via-lparticular attention 
the accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yettennom 
that captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday the list time since the accident had brought anne the last note which the had not been able to trace the exact steeple of 
had said a cow houryan d thenretumedagainto lame and without any present intention of quitting it any more 
he had enquired after her she found particularly 
had ex rested his hope of mice elliot’s not being the worse 
gar her lemons and had spoken of there exertions as great 
this was handsome and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done 
as to the sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of my sensible women whose judgments had to work on ascertained events 
and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtfulness and much imprudcnce 
t is effect were most alarming and that it wan frightfiil to think how on mine nfusgrove s recove might yet he doubtful an how liable she would nil remain to out 
d from the caucus-ion hereafter 
the admiral wound it all up luminarin by exclaiming 
a ay a very bad holiness indeed 
a new sort of way thin for a young fellow to be making love by breaking hit mistrcae’e head is not it miss elliot 
this in breaking a head and giving a planter tnrlyl 
admiral crot't’u manners were not quite of the tone to suit lad russell but the delighted anne 
his godless old heart and simplicity of characters were irreeietiblc 
1801 persuasion 
now thin must be very bad for you laid lie luddenl rousing from n little reverie to be coming and ii in us here 
i had not recollected it before i declare but it 
must be very bad 
but now do not and upon ceremony 
get up and go over all the monks in the home if you like it 
a another time sir i thank you 
not now a a well whenever it wit you 
you can lip in from the ihruhbery at any time 
and there you will and we keep our umbrella in up by that door 
a good place in not it 
but a checking herself you will not think it a good place 
for your were always kept in the battle 
room 
ay no it always ll i believe 
one means way 
may be at good a incl-her’l but we all like our own belt 
and no you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for you to go about the home or not r “anne pending the might decline it did it very grateful e we have made very few changes either continued the admin-4| after thinking a moment 
very few 
we told you about the laundry-door at uppercrou 
that has been a very great improvement 
the wonder wan how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of it opening an it did it long 
you will tell sir walter what we have done and that mr shepherd thinking the greatest improvement the house ever had 
indeed i most do ourselvel the justice to any that the few alteration 
we have made have been all very much for the better 
my wife should have the credit of them however 
i have done very little beeidee tending away game of the large looking-glam from my dmaing-mom which want your father 
a very good man and very much the gentlemen i am lure 
but i should think miu elliot 
looking with serious reflection i ihould think he must be rather i nusunsrorw 
12th dreuy man for his time of life 
such a number of looking-glam 
oh lord 
there was no getting am from one half 
so i got sophy to lend me a ban and we noon shifted their quarters 
and now i am quite snug with my little shaving-glain one corner and another great thing that i never go near anne amueed in spite ofhereelf wan rather diatreued for an answer 
and the admiral fearing he might not have been civil enough took up the object again to m y the next time you write to your good father miu elliot pray give my compliments and mr 
cross and that we are settled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to and with the lace 
the breakfast-room chimney makes a little grant on but it in only when the wind ll due north and bowing hard which may not happen three time 
a winter 
and take it altogether now that we have been into coat of the bonnet hereahoute and an judge there in not one that we like better than this 
pray say no with my compliments 
he will be glad to hear it 
lady russell and croft were very well pleased with each other but the acquaintance which the visit began was fated not to proceed far at relent 
for when it will returned the grass announced themselves to he going away for a few weeks to visit their complexion in the north of the county and probably might not be at home again before lady russell would be removing to bath 
so ended all danger to anyone of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hall or of seeing him in comes 
pany with her friend 
everything was fed enough and he mailed over‘the many anxioul feeling the had wanted on the subject 
130 rensuasron 
chapter 317 
though charleind ma had remained at lyme much longer after r and my muegrove'l going than anyone conceived they could have been at all wanted they were yet the list of the family to be at home again 
and at noon at possible after their return to a percrote they drove over to the lodge 
they had let r. louisa be owning to lit up 
but her had though clear wan exce ingly weak and her nerve susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness 
and though ill might be enounced to be altogether doing very well it wan nil impossible to say when the might be able to hear the removal home 
and her father and mother who must return in time to receive their younger children for the chimney holidayn had hardly a ha of being allowed to bring her with them 
they ha been all in lodgings together 
mrs jungle had got mrs harvillc’r children away i much as the could every possible iupply from uppercrou had been finished to li ten the inconvenience to the harville while the artillery had been wanting them to come to dinner every day 
and in hurt it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side at to which should be most disinterested and horrible 
mary had had her evil but upon the whole as wan evident by her staying so long she had found more to enjoy than to taller 
charlehayter had been at l me oftener than invited her 
and when they dined with the harville there had been only a maid-servant to wait and at first mrs harville had always given me mangrove precedence 
but then the had received so very handsome an apology from her on sending out where daughter the was and there had been so much going on every day there had been no many walkmuseum 
l 
between their lodgings and the harville and she had got books from the library and changed them so often that the balance had certainly been much in favour of ye 
she had been taken to charmouth too and she had bathed and she had gone to church and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at lamer than at uppercrou 
and all this joined to the sense of being so very useful had made really an agreeable fortnight 
anyone in tired after captain benwick 
mary s face was clouded directly 
charles laughed 
oh 
captain benwick is very well i believe but he is a very odd young man 
i do not know what he would be at 
we asked him in come home with mr for a day or two charles undertook to ve him come shooting and he seemed quite delight and for my part i thought it was all settled when behold on tuesday night he made a very awkward sort of an excuse 
he never shot a and he had been quite milundemood c and he had promised this and he had promised that and the end of it was i found that he did not mean to come 
i sup so he was afraid of sending it dull 
but upon my wo i should have though 
we were lively enough at the cottage for such a heartbroken man as ca tain benwick.’ charles laugh again and said now ma you know very well how it really was 
it was all your doing a turning to anyone 
e fancied that if he went with us he should and ou close by he fancied everybody to be living in ppercross 
and when he discovered that lady russell lived three mile of his heart failed him and he had not courage to come 
that is the fact upon my honour 
mary knows it is but mary did not give into it very gracious whether from not considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation to begin love with an elliot or from not want :32 persuasion 
in 
to believe anne a greater attraction to uppercrou than heneii mun be left to be guessed 
angel goodwill however war not to be deafened by what he heard 
she boldly acknowledged heraelf chattered and confronted her nice 
oh he us of you cried charles in arch terrm 
mary interrupted him 
i declare charles i never heard him mention anne twice all the time wan there 
i declare anne he never talk of you at all 
d no ndmitted charles d i do not know that he ever does in a general way 
but however it in a very clear thing that he admired you exceedingly 
his head in full of come hooks that he in reading upon your commendations and he wants to talk to you about them 
he he found out something or other in one of them which he thinks 
oh 
i can not pretend to remember it but it um something very one 
i overheard him telling henrietta all about it 
and then a nice elliot’s was spoken of in the highest termal now mary i declare it was to i heard it myself 
and you were in the other room 
a el ance iweetneu beanty.’ oh 
there war no end of in elliot’s charml 
and i am sure cried mary warmly it was very little to his credit if he did 
miss harville only died laat june 
such a heart it very little worth having in it lady russell 
i am cure you will agree with me 
d i mun are cafmin benwick before i decide laid lady russell am my 
e and that you are very likely to do very noon i can tell you ma'am laid charles 
a though he had not never for coming away with m and setting off again afterwards to y a formal visit here 
he will make his way over to ellen one day by herself you ma depend on it 
i told him the distance and the road 
persuasion 
i 33 and i told him of the church s being so very well worth aeeing 
for an he has a taste for those sort of things i thou hit that would be a good excuse and he listened with l hie demanding and soul 
and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here ooon 
so i give you notice lady russell 
a any acquaintance of anne’s will be always welcome to me a wan lady ruuell’l kind answer 
a oh i an to being anne’s acquaintance d said mary d i think he it rather my acquaintance for i have been ieeing him every day thin last fortnight 
a ell as your 
aim acquaintance then i shall be very happy to see pain benwick 
b you will not and anything ve agreeable in him i nature you ma'am 
he in one o the fullest young men that ever lived 
he hung walked with me sometimes from one end of the and w the other without saying a word 
he in not at all a half-bred young man 
i am sure you will not like him 
a there we differ mary laid anne 
i think lady russell would like him 
i think the would be no much pleased with his mind that she would very noon see no deficiency in his manners a so do i anne laid charles 
i am sure lady russell would like him 
he in june lady russell s tort 
give him a book and he will read all day long 
yes 
that he will i d replied mary tauntingly 
a he will sit peering over his book and not know when a person speak 
to him or when one drop 
one lesson or anything that happens 
do you think lady russell would like that i 
lady russell could not help laughing 
a upon my word said she 
i ihould not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such differ 
once of conjecture needy and matter of fact at i may r34 ensuasron 
call mylelf 
have really ourioitytonee the person who can give union to inch directly oppoaiu notion 
l with he may be indncodlo all here 
and when he does mary you may depend hearing my opinion hulamdeteminednotlojdehimbeforehand.’ b you will not like him 
i will answer for it 
lady russell began talking of something clue 
mary spoke with animation of their meeting with or rather midng mr elliot to extraordinary 
he in a man mid lady russell 2 whom i have no wish to lee 
he declining to he on cordial term with the head of his family had left a very mung impressions in his diafavonr with me 
this deciaion checked mag eagerness and named her lord in the mind of the lot countenance 
with regard to captain wentworth though anne haurded no inquiries there was voluntary communication tuflicient 
hi spirit had been greatly recovering lately i might be expected 
a louisa improved he had improved and he wan now nice a different cream from what he had been the 31 week 
he had not seen louisa 
and was an extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview that he did not prey for it at all 
and on the contrary seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days till her head was stronger 
he had talked of going down to youth fur a week and wanted to nurse captain benwick to go with him 
but an harlet maintained to the man 
captain benwick leaned much more disposed to ride over to kellynch 
there can be no doubt that lad russell and anyone were both oecalionnlly thinking of captain benwick from thin time 
lady russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be hit herald 
nor could anyone return from any stroll of culinary inplnsnssxon 
135 dulgence in her father s grounds or any visit of charity in the village without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him 
ca rain benwick came not however 
he was either ecu disposed for it than charles had imagined or he was too shy 
and after giving him a week's indulgence lady russell determined him to he unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite 
the mud roves came back to receive their ha y boys and from school bringing with them s hsrville’s little children to improve the noise of uppercrou and lessen that of ye 
henrictu remained with louisa but all the rest of the family were again in their union uarters 
lady russell an anne hid their compliments to them once when anyone cnultia not but feel that uppercrou was already quite alive again 
though neither henrietta nor louisa nor charles walter nor captain wentworth were there the room presented as strong a contrast as could he wished to the last state she had seen it in 
immediately surrounding mrs musgroee were the little hnrvillcs whom she was scdulously guarding from the tay inn of the two children from the cottage expressly to amuse them 
on one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls cutting up silk and gold per 
and on the other were dresses and trays hen ng under the weight of brawn and cold pies where riotous boys were holding high revel 
the whole completed by a roaring christmaﬁre which seemed determined to he heard in spite of all the noise of the others 
charles and mary also came in of course during their visit and mr mangrove made a point of paying his respects to lady russell and sat down close to her for ten minutes talking with i very raised voice but from the clamor of the children on his try persuasion 
knees generally in vain 
it was 
a one familyanne judging from her own temperament would have deemed ouch a domed hurricane a had restorative of the nerve which louia’t illneat must have it gently shaken 
but my mule who got anne near her on purpose to thank her foot cordially again and again for all her attention to them concluded a short recapitulation of what the had suffered herself by opening with a happy glance round the room that after all the had gone through nothing wan to likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulneu at home 
louisa wan now recovering space 
her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home before her brother and peter 
wit to school again 
the harville had promised to come with her and ray at uppercrou whenever the returned 
captain wentworth wan gone for the present to are his brother in shropshire 
31 hope i shall remember in future laid lady russell ll soon at the were reflected in the carriage not to call at ppercroel in the chriunuu h idaya.” everybody has their taste in noise as well up in other matters 
and sounds are quite innnxiom or most dirtreuing 
by their tort rather than their quandty 
when lady rum not long afterwards was entering bath on a wet afternoon and driving through the long court of meet from the old bridge to camden place amid the dash of other carriage the heavy rumble of calm and day the bawling of news mufﬁn-men and milking and the cent-lets clink of pattern uh made no complaint 
no then were notice which belonged to the winter plonturet 
her spirit rate under their influence 
and like mrs mangrove he was feeling though not crying that after being long in the rusmsron 
31 coun n couldheao forherualittle my mind 3004 anne did not there these feelings 
she d in a very determined though very silent dieine ination for bath 
caught the hut dim view of the extensive buildings making in mind without any wish of ieeing them better 
felt their progress through the meet to be however iii-agreeable yet too rapid 
for who would be glad to lee her when he arrived 
and looked back with fond regret to the burden of uppercrou and the delusion of kellynch 
elizabeth last letter had communicated a piece of new of some interest 
mr elliot war in bath 
he had called in camden place 
had called a second time i third 
had been pointedly attentive 
if elizabeth and her father did not deceive them-clue had been taking an much pain to seek the acquaintance and proclaim the value of the connection at he had formerly taken paint to chow neglect 
thin was very wonderful if it were true 
and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about mr elliot already repairing the sentiment ohe had no lately expressed to ma of llll being a man whom she had no with to ice 
d she had a great with to see him 
if he really caught to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he must he for even for having diamembered himself from the poem tree 
anyone wan not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance but the felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not which was more than she could any for many other persons in bath 
she wan put down in camden place and lady russell then drove to her own lodgings in riven street 
ran 
persuasion 
chapter 117 
i walter had taken a we good house in camden place a loft digniﬁ situation ruch ll becomes a man of consequence 
and both he and elizabeth were settled there much to their satisfaction 
anyone endured it with a sinking hart anticipating an imprinnrnent of many months and anxious saying to herself oh 
when shall i leave you again 
a degree of unexpected cordiality however in the welcome the received did her good 
her father and deer were glad to see her for the sake of ieeing her the home and ﬁimiturc and met her with kindness 
her making a fourth when they sat down to dinner was noticed a an advantage 
my clay wan v pleasant and very ailing but her eourteaiea and uri as were more a matter of course 
anyone had any felt that the would pretend what wan proper on her arrival but the complaining of the other was unlocked for 
they were evidently in excellent spirits and the wan soon to linen to the meet 
they had no inclination to linen to her 
after laying out for some compliment of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood which anyone could not pay they had only a few faint inquiries to make before the talk must be all their own 
uppercrou excited no interest kellynch very little it were all bath 
they had the pleasure of acquiring her that bath more than answered their expectations in every respect 
their home was undoubtedly the belt in camden place their drawing-roomhad many decided advantage over all the other which they had either ten or heard of and the m riority wan not scorn in the at leg of the ﬁtting-up or t taste of the furniture 
heir persuasion 
149 acquaintance wan exceedingly nought after 
everybody wan wanting to visit them 
they had drawn back from many introduction and still were perpetually having card left by people of whom they knew nothing 
here were found enjoyment 
could anyone wonder that her father and thither were hoping she might not wonder but the mun nigh that r father ihould feel no degradation in his change would see nothing to regret in the quiet and dignity of the accident landholder ihould find no much to vain of in the littleness of a town 
and the mute light and miles and wonder too as elizabeth threw open the folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawingroom to the other howling of their space at the possibility of that woman who had been mistress of kellynch hall ending extent to be proud of between two walla perhapo thirty feet asunder 
but this was not all which they had to make them ha py 
they had mr elliot too 
anyone had i great deal to hear of mr elliot 
he was not only pardoned they were delighted with him 
he had been in bath about afortnight 
he had used through bath in november in hit way to on on when the intelligence of sir walters being settled there had of course reached him though only twenty-four hour in the place but he had not been able to avail himself of it 
but he had now been a fortnight hat in bath and his list object on arriving had been joined his card in camden lilace following it up b iueh uniduout endeavour to meet and when they did meet by each great openings of conduct ouch reading to apologize for the pat inch aolicitude to he received m a relation again that their former good understanding was completely re-eetablithed 
they had not a fault to and in him 
he had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own k i40 finder 2 
aside 
it had originated in minpprehenlion entirely 
he had never had an idea of throwing himself of t he had feared that he was thrown off but knew not why and delicacy had kept him silent 
upon the hint of having spoken diareapectfully or careless of the family and the family honour he wan quite indignant 
he who had ever boomed of being an elliot and whose feeling at to connection were only too stick to until the unusual tone of the present day 
he wan iitoniohed indeed but his character and general conduct mint refute it 
he could refer sir walter to all who knew him 
and certainly the pains he had been taking on thin the fact op rotundity of reconciliation tobe rentnred w the flooring of relation and heirreeumptive war a strong proof of hit opinion on the estate circumstance of his marriage too were found to admit of much cxtenuation 
thin was an article not to be entered on by himself 
but a very intimate friend of his a colonel willie a highly re ctable min perfectly the gentleman and nor 
an ill -loolting man sir walter added who was living in very good style in marlborough buildings and had at his own particular retreat been admitted to their acquaintance through mr el it had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage which made a material difference in the discredit of it 
colonel wallis had known mr elliot long had been well acquainted also with his wife had perfectly understood the whole story 
she was certainly not a woman of family but well educated accomplithed rich and exoeuively in love with his friend 
there had been the charm 
she had taught him 
without that attraction not all her money would have tempted elliot and sir walter was moreover nature of her having been a very one woman 
here was a great deal to often the bureau 
a very one woman with a large fortune in persvasion.‘ :41 love with him sir walter seemed to admit it as complete apology 
and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light she allowed it to be a great extenuation 
mr elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for they gave no dinners in 
general 
delighted in short by every proof of cousin notice and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in camden place 
anyone listened but without quite understanding it 
allowances large allowances must be made for the ideas of those who spoke 
she heard it all under embellishment 
all that sounded extravagantorimtional in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relations 
still however she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared 
in mr elliot’s wishing after an interval of so many years to be well received by them 
in a worldly view he had nothing to gain by being on terms with sir walter 
nothing to risk by a state of radiance 
in all probability he was already the richer of the two and the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title 
a sensible man and he had looked like a cry sensible man why should it be an object to him 
she could only offer one solution it was pity for elizabeth’s sake 
there might really have a lilting former 
though convenience and accident had drawn him a dim rent way 
and now that he could afford to lease himself he mid ht mean to pay his addresses to her 
elizabeth was certain y veryhsndsome 
with swelled elegant manners and her character might never have been penetrated by mr elliot knowing her but in public and when very young himself 
how her temper and understanding might hear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and izz 
watson 
rather fearful one 
most earnestly did the with that he might not be too nice or too servant if elizabeth were hit object 
and that elizabeth wan to believe herself to and that her friend mr lay wan encouraging the idea seemed apparent by a glance or two between them while mr elliot’s frequent visits were talked of 
anyone mentioned the glimpse the had had of him at lyme but without being much attended to 
oh yes perhaps it had been mr elliot 
they did not know 
it might be him perhaps 
they could not linen to her dear ration of him 
they were driving him themeelvee 
sir walter especially 
he did justice to hit very gentlemanlike up see his air of elegance and fashion his good-aha face he eenlible eye 
but at the same time a most lament his being wry much undergoing a defect which time seemed to have increued 
nor could he pretend to nay that ten year had not altered almost every feature for the wane 
mr elliot appeared to think that he sir walter war looking exactly n he had done when they last parted 
but sir walter had a not been able to return the compliment entirely which had embarrass him 
he did not mean to complain however 
mr elliot was better to look at than most men and he had no objection to he been with him anywhere mr elliot and his friend 
in marlborou h buildings were talked of the whole evening 
co oncl wallis had been to impatient to be introduced to them and mr elliot is anxious that he ihould l c and there war 3 mn wallis at present known one to them by deleription at ill wan in daily expectation of her conﬁnemcnt 
but mr elliot spoke of her an d a most church in woman quite worthy of being known in camden place and at noon ache recovered the were to be acquainted 
sir walter thought much of my wallis 
nasmsrorr 
149 she was if to he an excessively pretty woman henntiful 
a he longed to see her 
e she might make tome amends for the many very air faces head continually panting in the streets 
lie worst of bath was the number of its plain women 
he did not mean to say that there were no pretty women but the number of the plain wan out of all proportion 
he had frequently observed as he walked that one hand face would be followed by thirty or live-and-thirty fright 
and once as he had wood m a shop in bond street he had counted eighty-seven women go by one after another without there being a tolerable face among them 
it had been a frosty morning to be sure a sharp front which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of 
but still there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath 
and as for the men 
they were inﬁnitely worse 
such scarecrowat the streets were full of 
it was evident how little the women were used to the eight of anything tolerable by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced 
he had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with colonel wallis who was n ne military ﬁgure though sandy-haired without observing that every woman eye was upon him 
every woman c was sure to be upon colonel wallis 
modest sir alter 
he was not allowed to escape however 
his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting that colonel wallis’s corn nion might have 31 good a figure as colonel wallis and certain was not sand haired 
a how in mary ooking 
d i sir walter in the height of his good humour 
2 the inn time i saw her she had a red note but i hope that my not happen every day 
a oh 
no that must have been quite accidental 
in neutral she has been in very good health and very good god since michaelmaa.” 144 rnasuasrou

anyone wan wondering whether the ihould venture to suggest that a gown 
or a can would not be liable to any web mine when i knock at the door i need every 
thing 
a knock at the door 
and no steel it what ten o'clock 
could it be mr elliot 
they knew he want to dine in london crescent 
it was possible that he might imp in hit way home to ark them how they did 
they could think of no one else 
my clay decidedly thou hit it mr elliot’s knocking my clay wan right 
it all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give mr elliot wan ulhered into the room 
it what the tame the very same man with no difference but of dread 
anyone drew a little back while the other received his compliments and her litter hit npologiea for calling at no mutual an hour but a he could not be to near without waiting to know that neither the nor her friend had taken cold the day before am a 
which was all i. politely done and no politely taken ll possible but her part must follow then 
sir walter talked of m youngest daughter 
a mr elliot must give him leave to present him to fall longest day later there we no occasion for rememring maryj‘ 
and annoy smiling and blushing very becomineg owed to mr elliot the retty feature which he had by no meant forgotten an instantly iiw with amusement at hit little cart of surprise that he had not been at all aware of who the war 
he looked completel utonithed but not more astonished than pleated ltit cyee brightened 
and with the most rfect thicrity he welcomed the relationthip allude to the pan and annexed to be revived :15 an acquaintance already 
he was quite as good-looking as he had appersuasion 
4d parted at lyme llll countenance improved by speaking and his manners were to exactly what they ought to be no polished to easy to early agreeable that she could compare them in excellence to only one penny rnannen 
they were not the tame but they were perhaps e unlly good 
he eat own with them and in raved their conversation very much 
there could no doubt of his being a sensible man 
ten minutes were enough to verify that 
hit tone his expression his choice of subject his knowing where to stop it was all the operation of a sensible ditcerning mind 
as soon to he could he began to talk to her of ye wanting to compare opinionl expecting the place but especially wanting to work of the circumstance of their happening to he guest ii the lame inn it the tame time 
to give his own route understand something of here and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying hie respects to her 
she gave him a short account of her party and business at lyme 
he regret increaled at he listened 
he had put his whole eolitary evening in the room adjoining theirs 
had heard voices mirth continually 
thought they must be a most delightful net of people longed to be with them but certainly without the mallets suspicion of m mang the shadow of i right to introduce himself 
f he had but asked who the party were 
the name of mir-grove would have told him enough 
a well it would nerve to cure him of to beard practice of never using a question it an inn which he had adopted when quite e young men on the principle of its being very genteel to be curious 
the notion 
of a young men of one or two and want said he stop to what ll neoconry in manners e him uite the thing are more absurd i believe than those o my other set of being in the world 
l 46 persuasion 
the folly of the meal they often employ in only to he equalled by the folly of what they have in view but he must not be addressing his reﬂectionto anne alone he knew it 
he was noon dilfueed again among the other and it wan only at intervals that he could return to ye 
his inquiries however produced at length an account of the scene he had been engaged in there soon after hit leaving the place 
having alludedto 2 an accident he mun hear the whole 
when he questioned sir walter and elizabeth began to question also but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be un 
felt 
she could only compare mr elliot to lady dunes in the with of really comprehending what had paused and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it 
he raised an hour with them 
the elegant little clock on the mantel-piece had struck a eleven with it silver ioundl 
and the watchman wan beginning to he heard it 3 dimnec telling the lame talk before mr elliot or any of them teemed to feel that he had been there long 
anyone could not have supposed it possible that her lift evening in camden place could have passed l0 well 
chapter wu 
here was one point which anne on returning to her family would have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliot’s being in love with elizabeth which war her futhcr’l not being in love with my clay 
and he war very far from easy about it when she had been at home a few hours 
on going down to breakfast the next morning 
the found pirsuasioii‘ 
149 there had just been a decent pretence on the lady's side of meaning to lave them 
she could imagine mrs clay to have said that now miss anne was come she could not suppose herself at all wanted 
for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper that must not be any reason indeed 
i assure you i feel it none 
she is nothing to me compared with you 
and she was in full time to hear her father say a my dear madam this must not be 
as yet you how seen nothing of bath 
b you have been here only to be useful 
you must not run away from us now 
you must stay to beacup'ainted with us wallis the beautiful mrs wallis 
of our line mind i well know the sight of beauty is a gratiﬁcation.” he spoke and looked so much in earnest 
that anyone was not surprised to see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself 
her countenance perhaps might ex re some watchfulness 
but the praise of the one mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister 
the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties and promise to stay 
in the course of the same morning ann and her father chancing to be alone to either he began to compliment her on her impm looks 
he thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks 
her skin her complexion greatly improved 
clearer fresher 
had she been usin anything in particular 
no nothing 
merely lowland a he supposed 
d no nothing at all 
half he was surprised at that 
and added a certainly you can not do better than continue as you are 
you can not be better than well 
or i should recommend growled the constant use of holland during the spring months 
may clay has been using it at my commendations and you see what it l'lii done for her 
you see how it has carried away her freckles.” r48 reasuaswx 
if elizabeth could but have heard thitl such percanal praise might have struck her especially at it did not appear to anyone that the reckless were at all learned 
but everything mun take in chance 
the evil of the marriage would be much diminished if elizabeth were also to marry 
all for herself the might alwayl command a home with lady rune“ 
lady runeil’a composed mind and polite manners were put to come trial on thin point in her intercoune in camden place 
the eight of marley in inch favour and of anyone i overlooked wi a perpetual vocation to her there 
and vexed her ll much when the war away up a person in bath who drinks the water gets all the new publication and hat a very large acquaintance hnl time to be vexed 
all mr elliot became known to her the grew more charitable or more indifferent toward the other 
hit manner were an immediate recommendation 
and on converting with him the found the old a fully ai porting the mperﬁcial that the way at first an the to d anne almost ready to exclaim

without pride or weakness

never man away with y tpiriu or by ielﬁahneu which fancied inelf rang feeling 
and yet with a iemihility to what wan amiable and lovely and a value for all the felicitiel of domestic life which character of fancied enthuiiaarn and violent agitation teldorn really poueu

her at action in mr elliot outweighed all the plague of my clay 
it wan now some year since anyone had begun to learn that he and her excellent friend could iometinieu think differently 
and it did not surprise her therefore that lady rune“ ehould lee nothing auspicioua or incontinent nothing to requires more moved than appeared in mr elliot’s great degree of reconciliation 
n lady runell’r view it we 
perfectly natural that mr elliot at a mature time of li should feel it a most definite object and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people to be on good tenant with the head of hi 
family 
the simple price in the world of time upon a head naturelly clear and only earrings in the heavy of youth 
anyone premmed however all to smile about it and at slut to mention 
elizabeth 
lady russell listened and looked and made only this ceuu'oue reply 
elizabeth 
very well 
time will explain it were l reference to the future which anyone offer a little observation 
fell the must submit to 
she could determine nothing at present 
in that house elizabeth must be lint 
and the was in the habit of such general oboervance an 
nice elliot 2 that any particulars of attention ieemed almoet impouible 
mr elliot too it must be remembered killed not been a widower aeven month 
a little delay on his ride might be very excitable 
in fact anyone could never lee the creeps round his hat without fearing that the war the inexcusable one in contributing to him much imagination for though his marriage had not been very happy still it had excited to many cellar that the could not comprb 15o rensuesxon 
heaven rag reoov fromthelwﬁtlim n of it beingdi-glived 
a b c however it might end he wan without any question their plenantett acquaintance in bath the saw nobody equal to him 
and it wae.a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lure which he seemed to have ll lively a wish to see again and to see more of at herlelf 
they went through the particular of their first meeting a great many times 
he gave her to understand that he had looked at her with tome untestneu 
she knew it well 
and the remembered another pem n't look also 
they did not always think alike 
hit value for rank and conception the perceived to be greater than hen 
it was not merely complainance it must he a liking to the came which made him enter warmly into her father and little mlicitudet on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them 
the bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the danger viecountcu dalrymple and her daughter the honourable mitt carteret 
and all the comfort of no 
— camden place 
was swept away for many days 
for the dalryrnplel in anne'e opinion most unfortunately were count of the elliot 
and the agony wat how to introduce themaelvet properly 
anyone had never seen her father and winter before in contact with nobility and the mute acknowled e herself dinppointed 
she had hoped better thing mm their high ideal of their own situation in life and was reduced n form a with which the had never forgotten 
a with am they had more pride 
for your cousins 
lady dalrymple and mix carteret 
b c our contented palrym rice loungers in her care all day long 
sir alter had once been in company with the late mum but had never seen any of the rest of the the difficulties of the case arose from there persuasion 
i d i having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late viscount when in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walters at the same time there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch 
no letter of condolence had been sent to ireland 
the neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner 
for when poor lady elliot died herself no letter of condolence was received at kellynch and consequently there was but too much reason to s present that the dalrymple considered the relationalin as closed 
how to have this anxious busineu set to rights and be admitted as cousins again was the question and it was a question which in a more rational manner neither lady russell nor mr elliot thought unimportant 
a family coonexions were always worth reserving good company always worth seeking 
lady alr place had taken a house for three months in laura lace and would be living in style 
she had been at bath the year before and lady russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman 
it was very desirable that the complexion should be renewed if it could be done without any compromise of propriety on the side of the elliot 
sir walter however would choose his own means and at last wrote a very one letter of ample ex lanation regret and entreaty to his right honour-ab e cousin 
neither lady russell nor mr elliot could admire the letter 
but it did all that was wanted in bringing three lines of scrawl from the danger viscountess 
she was very much honoured and should be happy in their acquaintance the toils of the business were over the sweets began 
they visited in laura place they had the cards of danger viscountess dalrymple and the honourable miss carteret to be arranged wherever they might be most visible and a our cousins in laura place 
— a our cousins lady dalrymple and miss carter a were talked of to everybody 
15a ammo 
anyone was alarmed 
had lady dalrym leg and her daughter even been very agreeable the would kill have been ashamed of the agitation they created but they were nothing 
there was no ruperiority of manner 
accomplishment or nndemanding 
lady dalrym le had acquired the name of a charming woman all the had a mile and a civil anawer r everybody 
mice carter with will lean to lay wan to plain and lo awkward 
that the would never have been tolerated in camden place but for her birth 
lady russell confessed that till had expected something better 
but yet it was an acquaintance worth having 
and when anyone ventured to k her opinion of them to mr elliot he agreed to their being nothing in themselves but still maintained that at a family connexion a good come any at there who would collect good can any around them they had their value 
anyone smiled and’amd 
a y idea of good company mr elliot it the company o clever well-informed people who have a great d of convention 
that is what i call good corn ny 
a ou ire make a paid he gently 2 that in not good company 
that ll the but 
good company requirel on y irth education and manner and with regard to education is not very nice 
birth and good manners are euenﬁnl 
but a little learning it by no means a clean trout thing in good company 3 on the contrary it will do very well 
my cousin anne chalth her head 
she in not retired 
she in futidioru 
my dear cousin lilting down by her b you have a better right to be faatidioue than almost any other woman i know 
but will it inlwer 
will it make on happy 
will it not be wiser to accept the society o theae ood ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages of the complexion a in an audible 
you may depend upon persuasion i 53 igthatdteywillmoveintheﬁrstoetin baththis winter and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family our family let me any 
i in that degree of consideration which we must all me for ye a sighed anne 2 we shall indeed be known to be related to them 
a then rccollectin herself and not wishing to be answered she added a certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance 
i suppose smiling i have more pride than any of you 
but i confess it does vex me that we should be so delicious to have the relationship acknowledged which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them 
pardon me my dear cousin you are unjust to your own claims 
in london perhaps in your present quiet style of living it might be as ou sa 
but in bath sir walter elliot and his family will always be worth knowing always acceptable as acquaintance 
well a said anne 
i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon placed a i love your indignation d said he 
it is so natural 
but here you are in bath and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot 
you talk of being proud 
i am called round i know end i shall not wish to believe myself otherwise 
for our pride if investigated would have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem a little different 
in one not i am sure my dear cousin he continued speaking lower thou h there was no one else in the room 
in one point ilam sure we must feel alike 
we must feel that every addition to your father society among his equals or superiors may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him l 54 persuasion 
he looked as he spoke to the neat which men clay had been lately occupying a sufficient explanation of what he plrticularly meant 
and though anyone could not believe in their having the nine sort of pride the wan pleased with him for not liking mn clay 
and her conscience admitted that hit writhing to provoke her father getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defending her 
chapter £173 
hide sir walter and elizabeth were auiduounly pushing their good fortune in laura place anne wan renewing an acquaintance of a very different description 
she had called on her former governess and had heard from her of there being an old school-fellows in bath who had the two itrong claim on her attention of past kindness and present suffering 
mim hamilton now my smith had shown her kindness in one of those period 
of her life when it had been moot valuable 
anyone had gone unhappy to school grieving for the lost of a mother horror the had dearly loved feeling her separation from home and suffering to a girl of fourteen of strong sensibility and not high spirits must suffer at such a time 
and liable hamilton three your older than herself but still from the want of near relation 
and a rattled home remaining another year at school had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerable lcuened her misery and could never be remembered with indifference 
mim hamilton had left school had manicd not long afterwards we laid to have married a man of fortune and this was all that anyone had known of her till now reasmsron 
r s s that their govemess’s account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form 
she was a widow and poor 
her husband had been extravagant 
and at his death about two year 
before had left his affairs dreadfully involved 
she had had difficulties of every sort to contend with and in addition to these diseases had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever which finally settling in her legs had made her for the present a cripple 
she had come to bath on that account and was now in lodgings s near the hot baths living in a very humble way nnah e even to record herself the comfort of a servant and of course almost excluded from society 
their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from miss elliot would give mrs smith and annoy therefore lost no time in doing 
she mentioned nothing of what she had he or what she in 
tended at home 
it would excite no roper interest there 
she only consulted lady russell who entered through into her sentiments and was most ha to convict her as near to mrs smiths lodgings in estgate uildings as anyone chose to be taken 
the visit was paid their acquaintance re-eslnblishcd their interest in each other more than rekindled 
the first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion 
twelve years were gone since they had parted and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had ima ned 
twelve years had changed anyone from the booming silent unforrned girl of fifteen to the elm ant little woman of seven-andtwenty with every auty excepting bloom and with manners as consciously right as they were invarishly gentle 
and twelve years had transfomlcd the on-looking well 
grown miss walton in all the glow of health and conscience of superiority into a poor inﬁrm helpless widow receiving the visit of her l r 56 pensunsrou 
fonner protegée up a favour but all that won uncomfortable in the meeting had noon paued away 
and left on the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking our old times anne found in mrs smith the good acme and agree 
able manner 
which the had almost ventured to d on and a disposition to convex and be cheerful beyond her expectation 
neither the dinipationa of the put 
and the load lived very much in the world 
nor the reatrictiom of the present neither aicltneu nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirit 
in the courage of n necond wait she talked with great opened and anne’s astoniehlnent increaaed 
she could scarcely imagine a more cheering situation in itself than mrs smith 
she had been ve fond of her husband the had hurled him 
she had n need to silence it wan gone 
she had no child to connect her with life and happen again no relation to await in the arrangement of pen lexed affairs no health to make all the rent mpporta le 
her accommodationa were limited to a noisy parlour and a dark bedroom behind with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance which there we only one tenant in the house to afford and ill 
never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath 
yet in spite of all this anyone had reason to believe that the had moment only of languor and depressions to hour of occupation and enjoyment 
how could it be 
she watched ohaerved reflected and small determined that this was not a case of fortitude or o reaignation only 
a eubmiuive ipirit might be silent 
a strong understanding would apply reaolution t here wan something more 
hen wan that relativity of mind that din ton to be comforted that wer of turning readin 3 
evil to good and of in no empersuasion 
i s 7 payment which carried her out of herself 
which was mum nature alone 
it was the choicest is of heaven 
and annoy viewed her friend me one o thoae instances in which by a merciful appointment it seems designed to counterbalance almost eve other want 
there had been a time mrs smith told her when her spirits had nearly failed 
she could not call herself an invalid now compared with her state on first reaching bath 
then she had indeed been a pitiable object 
for the had caught cold on the journey and had hardly taken possession of her lodging before the was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain 
and all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse and ﬁnanoea at that moment particulatrly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense 
she had weathered it however and could truly say that it had done her good 
it had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands 
she had seen too much of the world to expect audden or disinterested attachment anywhere but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve and would not use her ill 
and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse up a sister of her landlady a nurse by profession and who had always a home in that house when unemployed chanced to be at liberty in time to attend her 
and she d said mrs smith besides nursing me most admirably hat really roved an invaluable acquaintance 
as soon as i co d use my hands she taught me to limit which has been a great amusement 
and she put me in the way of making these little threadcasel pin-cushions and card-racks which you always and me so way about and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in thin neighbourhood 
she has a large acquaintance of course profesaionally among those who r 58

can afford to buy and be dispose of m merchandizc 
she always take the right time for ap ying 
everybody heart it open you know when they have recently escaped from icvere pain or are recovering the bleating of health and nursed rooke thoroughly understand when to speak 
she in a shroud intelligent sensible woman 
here ii a line for acting human nature 
and ah ha 
a fund of good tense and starvation which at a companion make her inﬁnitely superior to thousands of those who having only received the but education in the world l know nothing worth attending to 
call it grip if you will but when nune rooke hill half an hour leisure to bestow on me the it lure to have something to relate that ll entertaining and probable something that makes one know one a better

women of that clue have great op rtunitiea and if they are intelligent may be well we listening to 
such varieties of human nature a they are in the habit of wuthering 
and it is not merely in in followed that they are well read 
for they ee it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting

of all the conflict and all the sacrifice that noble ut moat

and un lately a skin low an m on there are so man w forget to think seriously tillyit is almost too late anne saw the misery of such feelings 
the husband had not been what he ought and the wife had been led among that raft of mankind which made her think worse 
of the world than she hoped it deserved 
it was but 1 ‘ng emotion however with mrs smith 
she shook it off and soon added in i different tone i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs roche is in at present will furnish much either to interest or me 
she is only nursing mrs willie of marlborough buildings 
a mere pretty silly expensive fashionable woman i believe 
and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and livery 
i mean to make my profits of mrs wallis however 
she has plenty of man and i intend she shall buy all the high-priced things have in hand now anyone had called several dress on her friend before the existence of such a person was known in camden place 
at last it became necessary to speak of her 
sir walter elizabeth and mrs iglay retumed one morning from labour place with a sudden invitation from lady dairym le for the same evening and annoy was already engaged to spend that evening in wettgate buildings 
she was not sorry for the excuse 
they were only asked the was sure because lady dalrymple being kept at home by n bad cold was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her 
and she declined on her own account with great alacrity 
she was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow

merely who had been preterit while all thin panned now thought it advisable to leave the room and anyone could have said much and did long to lay a little in defence of bar friends not very diuimrlar claim to theirs but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her 
she made no reply 
she left it to himself to recollect that man smith was not the only widow in bath between thirty and forty with little to live on and no name of dignity 
anyone kept her appointment the other kept theirs and of course the heard the next morning that thatch had a delightful evening 
she had been the only one of the let absently for sir walter and elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship nervice themselves but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others and had been at the trouble of invention both lady russell and mr elliot

my dearest anne it would give me more deli ht than rs often felt at my time of life one was-obliged to turn away to rise to walk to s 
distant table and leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue the feelings this picture excited 
for a few moments her imagination an her heart were bewitched 
the idea of becoming what her mother had been 
of having the precious name of a lady elliot ﬁrst revived in herself 
of being restored to kellynch calling it her home again her home for ever was a charm which she could not immediately resist 
lady russell said not another word willing to leave the matter to its own operation 
and believing that could mr elliot at that moment with propriety have s late for himself l 
she believed in short what anne d not believe 
the same image of mr elliot speak in for himself brought annas to composure a 
the charm of kellynch and of a lady elliot’s all faded away 
she never could accent him 
and it was not only that her feelings were still averse to any man save one 
her judgment on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against mr elliot 
though they had now been an minted a month she could not be satisfied that she read y knew his character 
that he was i sensible man an agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle this was all clear enough 
he certainly knew what was right nor could she ax on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct

my harville must be an odd mother to part with them it long 
i do not understand it 
they are not at all nice children in my opinion

it may not be felt in bath with your nice pavemenn

i have not had a creature call on me time the second week in january except charles walter who he 
been calling much oftener than war welcome 
between ourselves i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at ye a long an louis 
it would have kept her a little out of his way 
the carriage in gone to-day to bring louisa and the harville to-rnorrow 
we are not used to dine with them however till the day after my mangrove in no afraid of her being fatigued by the journey 
which ll not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her 
and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow

let me know what you think of this 
i do not expect my children to he asked you know 
i can leave them at the great house very well for in month or six weeks 
i have this moment heard that the croft are going to bath almost immediately they think the admiral gouty 
charles heard it quite by chance th have not had the civility to give me any notice or of er to take anything 
i do not think they in me at all as neighbours

it woe almost too wonderful for belief and it was with the great effort that the could remain in the room preserve amir of calmness and newer the common question of the moment 
ha ily for her they were not many 
sir walter want to know whether the croft travelled with four horses and whether they were lilt to be situated in ouch a pan of bath at it might suit in elliot and himself to visit in 
but had little curiosity beyond 
a how in mary 
a said elizabeth 
and without waiting for in answer and pray what brings the croft to both i 
they come on the admiral’l account 
he ll thought to be gouty.” 
gout and decrepitude 
mid sir walter 
a poor old gentleman 
d have they any acquaintance here 
a naked elizabeth 
d i do not know 
but i can hardly suppose that at admin 
croft'l time of life and in his profusion he should not have many acquaintance in such i place as this 
i sud exact a said sir walter coolly 2 that admiral croft will be bent known in bath up the center of kellynch hall 
elizabeth may we venture to present him and hi 
wife in laura place 
b c oh no 
i think not 
situated us we are with lady dalrymple cmuina we ought to be very careful not to hem her with ucquamunce the wi t not approve 
if we were not related it would not ngnify 
but a quite the would feel ecrupuloue an to any proposal of ours 
we had better leave the croft to and their own level 
there are several odd-looking men walking about here who i am told are sailorl 
the croft will associate with them 
thin wan sir walter and elizabeth share of i 1 o persuasion 
interest in the letter 
when my clay had her tribute of more decent attention in an inquiry after mrcharlel mangrove and her one little boy anne war it liberty 
in her own room the tried to come reached it 
well wi t charles wonder how captain entworth would fee i perhaps he had quieted the field had louisa up had sealed to love had found he did not love her 
she could not endure the idea of treachery or levity or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend 
she could not endure that ouch a friendship on their should be covered unfairly 
captain benwick and louisa mangrove 
the high-epirited joyoue-tallting louisa mangrove and the detected thinking feeling reading captain benwick 
seemed each of then everything that would not suit the other 
their minds most diuimilar 
where could have been the attraction 
the answer noon presented itself 
it had been in imitation 
they had been thrown together neveral week 
they had been living in the lame unall family party iince henrietta’n coming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each other and leaning jun recovering from illness had been in an interesting lute 
and captain'benwick wan not ineonuolnble 
that was a point which anyone had not been able to avoid suspecting before 
and imp of drawing the same conclusion as mary from the resent course of events they arrived only to confirm the idea of his having felt some drawing of tenderness toward herself 
she did not mean however to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity than mary might have allowed 
she was persuaded that any tolerany genuing young woman who had listened and ieemed to eel for him would have received the lame compliment 
he had an affectionate heart he must love somebody 
persuasion 
i 7 i she aw no reason against their being by 
love hadline naval fervour to begin with an they would soon grow more alike 
he would gain cheerfirlneae and the would learn to he an enthuaiut for scott and lord byron 
nay that wan rohably learnt already 
of course they had fallen in love over poetry 
the idea of louisa mangrove turned into a pen of literary taste and sentimentally reﬂection war amuaing 
but the had no doubt of in being no 
the day at ye the fall from the cobb might indolence her health her newer her courage her character to the end of her life thoroughly an it appeared to have induced her fate 
the conclusion of the whole wan that if the woman who had been sensible of captain wentworth’e merits could be allowed to prefer another road there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder 
and if captain wentworth lost no friend hyit certainly nothing to he regretted 
no it was not regret which made anne’s heart beat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheeks when the thought of captain wentworth unuhaclded and free 
she had some feeling 
which she was ashamed to investigate 
they were too much like joy aenaeleu joy 
she longed to lee the croft 
but when the meeting took place it was evident that no manor of the new had yet reached them 
the visit of ceremony wan paid and returned 
and louisa mangrove war mentioned 
and captain benwick too without even half a mile 
the croft had placed themselves in lodgings in gay streetlperfeetly to sir walters satisfaction 
he wan not at l ashamed of the acquaintance and did in fact think and walk a great deal more about the admiral than the admiral ever thought or talked about him 
the croft 
knew quite ii many people in bath at m 
1801 persuasion 
they wished for 
and considered their intercourse with the elliot at a mere matter of form and not in the left likely to afford them any pleasure 
they brought with them their soon that of being always together 
he wondered to w to keep off the gout in my croft teemed to go that with him in everything and to walk for her life to do him good 
anyone aw them wherever the went 
lady russell took her out in her carriage nlrnott every morning 
and the never failed to think of them and never failed to teethent 
knowing their feelings up the did it what a meet attractive picture of happiness to her 
she always watched them a long it the could 
delighted to fancy the understood what they might be talking of at they walked along in ht indendence or equallzadelrghred to tea the edymirtl’t enrty shake of the end when he encountered an old friend and observed their eagerneu of conversation when occttionally forming into i little knot of the heavy mn croft looking an intelligent and keen at any of the pitch around her 
anyone was too much engaged with lady russell to he often walking herself 
but it to hop ed that one morning about a week or ten day a r the craft arrival it united her best to leave her friend or her friend carriage in the lower part of the town and return talons to camden place end in walking up miltom street the had the good fortune to meet with the admiral 
he wan ending by himself at a printthop window

the wind blow through one of the cupboard in the lame way 
when they were got a little farther anne venture again for what he had to communicate 
she had h 
when clare of milton street to have her curioeity gntiﬁed 
but the we still obliged to wait for the admiralhadmadeuphia mind not to begin tilltheyhad gained the greater mace and quiet of bolton 
end a all was not really my croft the mun let him have hit own way 
at won as they were fairly ascending belmont he began 
— a well now you shall hear something that will mprile you 
but dint of all you mun tell me the name of the young lady i am going to tall about 
that young lady you know that we have all been to concerned for 
the mice mil-grove that all thin ha been happening to 
her christian name i always forget her christian name anyone had been ashamed to appear to come round to loan ii the really did 
but now the could i rely suggest the name of a louisa 
ay ay mialouiu mangrove that it the name 
which 
i i rich young ladies had not ouch i number of line christian names 
i should never be out if they were all sophye or something of that sort 
well this mind louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederick 
he war courting her week after week 
the only wonder on what they could be waiting for till thebusineaaat lymecame 
then indeed it was clear enough that they must wait 
till her brain week to right 
but even then there war iornething odd in their way of going on 
instead of staying at lyme he went off to plymoudr and then he went off to see edward 
when we came back from forehead he was gone down to edward’e and there he has been ever since 
we have been nothing of him since november 
em sophy could not under it 
but now the matter hu taken the man a turn of all 
for this young lady thin lame mill uagrove instead of being to marry frederick ll to marry jamer benwick 
you know james benwick 2 
a little 
i am a little acquainted with captain benwick well he in to my him 
nay most likely they are married already for i do not know what they ihould wait for c. b c i thought in crick a leaving no man said after and i undenta'nedydfat he 25 excellent character 
oh 
yes yes there ll not a word to he said again jamel benwick 
he in only a command it ll true made last summer and these are bad time for getting on but he had not another fault that i know of 
an excellent good-hearted fellow i assure you 
a very active zealoul ofﬁcer too which in more than you would think for perlrapa 
for that united effort of manner 2 does not do him junioe.” 2 indeed you are mistaken there air 
i should never :76 reusummr 
august want of spirit from captain beuwick't mannerl 
i thought them rticulnrly and i will answer for it 
they would generally pleue.’ a well well ladies are the heat judges 
hut jamel benwick in there piano for me 
and though very likely it in all our partiality sophy and i can not help thinking frederick s manner better than he 
there in something about frederick more to our rue anne wascaught.‘ she had only meant to opposite the too common idea of spirit and gentleman being incompatible with each other not at all to represent captain benwick’t manner a the very best that could point he 
and after a little habitation the vital beginning to my d i wan not entering into any comparison of the two friend 
a but the rural interrupted her with 
and the thing it certainly true 
it in not a mere bitof gouip 
we have it from frederick himself 
hit litter had a letter from him yesterday in which he tell us of it and he had jury had it in a letter from harville written upon the spot from uppercrou 
i flue they are ill at uppercrou 
hit wan an opportunity which anyone could not resist 
the mid therefore i hope admiral i there it nothing in the it leg of captain wentworth’t letter to make you and re croft particularly unealy 
it did certainly seems last autumn if there were an attachment between him and louisa mutgmve 
but i hope it may he understood to have worn out on each tide equally and without violence 
i hope hll letter doe 
not breathe the spirit of an inflamed man 
not at all not at all there in not an oath or a murmur from beginning to and annoy looked down to hide her smile 
no no 
frederick is not a man to whine and complain 
he hat too much spirit for that 
if the girl numsrox 
xl ﬁ’wr nun ham it in very it ud ihould have a certainly 
but what i mean in that i hope there in nothing in wentworth’l manner of writing to make you suppose he think himaelf inflamed by his friend which might appear a know without it being absolutely lid 
i ihould very carry the inch a friendship ii he 
inheiated between him and caring benwick ihould be destroyed or even wounded y a clrcnmnance of thin tort 
yes ee i understand yon 
but there ll nothing at all of nature in the letter 
he does not give the lent ring at benwick 
dunnot in much lay a i wonder at it 
i have a mean of my own for wondering at it no you would not guns from his way of writing that he had ever thought of this mind what 3 her name 
for himself 
he very handmmely hopee th will be happy together 
and there ll nothing very un given in that i think anne d not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant to convey but it would have been useless to pity the inquiry farther 
she therefore satieﬁed heel with commonplace remarlu or quiet attention and the admiral had it all hit own way 
poor frederick laid he at an 
now he must begin all over a air with somebody else 
i think we met get him to th 
sophy mnat write and beg him to come to bath

hide admiral croft wu taking that wall with ann and expecting hit with of getting ca n wentworth to bath captain wentworth was ready on hit way thither 
before mrs croft had written he war arrived and the very next time anne walked out 
the law him 
mr elliot war attending hit two cousins and my clay 
they were in milton street 
it began to rain not much but enough to matter thelter delicate for women and quite enough to make it very desirable for mira elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in lady dalrymple’e carriage which war been waiting at a little distance the acme and my clay therefore turned into molland't while mr elliot to lady dahymplc w requested her ordnance 
soon joined them again nieces-fill of course 
lady dalrymple would be most happy take them home and would call for them in a few minute 
her ladyship carriage was a branch and did not hold more tinn four with any comfort 
mine carteret wet with her mother 
consequently it war not remarkable to expect accommodation for all the three camden place ladiet 
there could be no doubt at to mine elliot 
whoever suffered inconvenience the mute wife none but it occupied a little time to nettle the point of civility between the other two 
the rain eri a mere tribe and annoy was most iince in preserving a walk with mr elliot 
but the rain was also a mere trifle to my clay 
the would hardly allow it even to drop at all and her boots were so thick 
much thicker than mia anne’s 
and in about her civility rendered her quite at anxious to be left to walk with mr elliot u anyone could he and it we discussed between them unsunsron 
a 179 with a generosity so polite and so determined that the others were obliged to settle it for them 
miss elliot maintaining that mrs clay had a little cold spread and mr elliot deciding on a that hit coulin nets boots were rather the thief it was fixed accordingly that mrs clay 
should he of the party in the carriage 
and they had just reached this not when anyone as she eat near the window descned most decidedly and distinctly captain wentworth walking down the street 
her start was perceptible only to herself 
but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world the most unaccountable and absurd 
for a few minute 
she saw nothing before her it was all confusion 
she was lost and when the had scolded back her sense she found the others still waiting for the carriage and mr elliot always ohligingg 
just setting off for union sheet on n commission of mrs clare s 
she now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door 
she wanted to see if it rained 
why was the to suspect herself of another motive 
captain wentworth mun be out of sight 
she left her seat she would go 
one half of her should not he always to much wiser than the other half or always msgecn‘ng the other of being worse than it was 
she wool see if it rained 
she was sent back however in a moment by the entrance of captain wentworth himself among s party of gentlemen and ladies evidently his acquaintance and whom he must have joined a little below milsom street 
he was more obviously struck and confused by the right of her than she had ever observed before 
he looked quite red 
for the first time since their renewed acquaintance she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two 
she had the advantage of him in thepreparation of the insect few moments 
all 18 persuasion 
the overpowering blinding bewilderin ne effect of nag aurprile were over with her 
till however he had enough to fell it vm agitation pin plelnlre 
a nothing between delight and ninety 
he spoke to her end then turned ewe

they had dint 
of being in very much mgerher got ta speak to eat other with a considerable man ofawanntindiﬁ'erenoe and calmly 
but he co d not do it now 
time had changed him or long had changed him 
there wan conlcinulnen of tome forty or other 
he looked very well not an if he had been ushering in health or pink and he talked of uppercrou of the mulgrovee nay even of louisa and had even a momentary look of his own arch iigniﬁcanee n he named her 
but 
yet it wo ca iain wentworth not comfortable not easy not able to feign that he was 
it did not caprice but it grieved annas to observe that elizabeth would not know him

d i wiahyon would make naeof it you are determined to walk 
though i think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair 
d she was very much obliged to him but declined it all repeating hercom'iction that the rain would come to nothing at present and adding a i am only waiting for mr elliot 
he will be here in a moment i am sure 
she had hardly spoken the word 
when mr elliot walked in 
captain wentworth recollected him perfecdy 
there was no difference between him and the man hadatood on the near at lymadmirin anne at she panted ex t in the air and look an manner of the privilege action and friend 
he came in with eagerness appeared to ace and think only her apologised for hi any war grieved to have k t her waiting and anxious to get her away without rther inn of time and before the rain increued 
and in another moment they walked of to either her arm under his a gentle and embam glance and a a good-morning to you 
being all that the had time for us the paved away

she could not under his preterit feelingl whether he were really ushering mud from dilappointment or not 
and rill that point were rattled the could not be quite herlelf 
she hope be wise and venerable in time 
but all blank the mute confer to herself that the war not wise yet another circumstance very essential for her know was how long he meant to be in bath 
he had not mentioned it or the could not recollect it

that one a table anevery body wan to meet every body in bath lady rune 
would in all likelihood lee him nowhere 
a would she recollect him 
how would it all be 
she had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa mangrove was to many captain benwick 
it had cost her something to encounter lady ruuell’a aurprile 
and now if she were by any chance to be thrown into come my with captain wentworth her imperfect knowl age of the matter might 
add another shade of prejudice against him 
the allowing morning anne was out with her friend and for the ink hour in an incessant and fearful can of watch on him in vain 
but at last in returning down pulmeney street the dininguilhed him on the right hand pavement at ouch adinance up to lave him in view the greater part of the meet 
there were many other men about him many groupe walking the same way but 
there was no making him 
she looked iniﬁnctively at lady run but not from any mad idea of her recogniaing him no noon at the did himself 
no it was not to be supposed that 
lady russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite 
she looked at her however from now to time anxioual 
and when the moment approach which moot point him out though not daring to look again for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen the wan yet perfectly conscious of lady runaell'l eyel being turned exactly in the direction for him

and with all the engcrneal compatible with anxiouelegance sir walter and hit two ladies stepped forward to meet her

the other joined them and it we a groan in which anne found 
ell aleo necessarily included 
she was divided from captain wentworth 
their intenting almost too tempting convenation mun be broken up for a time but alight war the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on 
she had learnt in the in ten minutes more of hi feelings towards louisa more of all his feelings than he dared to think of 
and all 
gave henelfup to the demand of the party to the needful civility of the moment with exquisite though agitated neneationa 
she me in good humour with all 
she had received ideal which dipped her to be courteouand kind to all and to pity every one a being lean ha y than herself

her ha meal was from within 
her eye were his hat an her cheek

but she knew nothing a t it 
she was thinking only of the last half hour and at they pained to their acute her mind took i hazy range over it 
his choice of abject hll expreuiont and'atill more hit manner and look had been inch an the could tree in only one light 
hit opinion of louin'mutgrove’t inferiority an opinion which he had seemed rolicitoru to give his wonder at captain benwick his feelings as to a hint rtrong attachment 
sentence begun which he could not finish hi half-averted eyes and more than half-exprellive glance all all declared that he had a hart returning to her at learnt 
that anger resentment avoidance 
were no more 
and that they were succeeded not merely by friends and regard but by the tenderness of the pair 
a tome share of the tendency of the part l she could not contemplate the change an implying lcu 
he must love her 
there were thoughts with their attendant viaionl which occupied and hurried her too much to leave heirnnsunsxon 
19 any power of observation 
and she patted along the room without having a glimpse of him without even a trying to discern him 
hen their plucwere determined on and they were all pearly arranged she looked round to see if he should happen to he in the name part of the room but he was not 
her eye could not reach him 
and the concert being just opening the must content for a time to be happy in an humbler way 
the y war divided and impelled of on we contiguoua chu anne was among those on the foremost and mr elliot had maneuvmd an well with the nance of hit friend colonel wallis an to have a neat by her 
mine elliot surrounded h her cousin and the principal object of colonel w lia’e gallantry was quite contented 
area mind we in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening 
it war just occupation enough the had feeling for the tender spirits for the gay attention for the scientific and patience for the wearisomest 
and had never liked a concert better at least during the list act 
towards cone of it in the interval aucceeding an italian along she explained the words the song to mr elliot 
they had a concert bill between them 
this a laid the e in nearly the tender or rather the running of the worth for certainly the tense of an italian love-song must not he talked of but it it no nearly the meaning an i can give 
for i do not pretend to understand theiangunge 
i am a very poor italian acholar 
yet year i see you are 
i ace you know nothing of the matter 
you have only knowledge enough of the language to branches at night these inverted turtlcunailed italian liner into clear comprehendble elegant engliah 
you need not y anything more of your ignorance 
here is complete proof 
x92 persuasion 
d i will not of ouch kind politeness 
but i should be sorry to examined by a real proﬁcient 
i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place long a replied he d without knowing something of mine anne elliot 
and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware 2 of half her accomplishment and too highly accompliahed for modesty to be natural in any other woman 2 for shame 
for thamel thin to too much of mastery 
i forget what we are to have next turning to the bill 
perhaps said mr elliot 
speaking low i have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of a indeed how so 
you can have been acquainted with it only since i came to bath excepting an u might he 
me previoust spoken of in my own face y 
i knew you by report long before you came to bath 
i had heard you described by those who knew you intimately 
i have been acquainted with you by character many years 
your person your dirpositiun accomplishment manner 
they were all described they were all present to me 
mr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise 
no one can withstand the charm of such a mystery 
to have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance by nameless place in irresistible 
and annoy wan all curiosity 
her wondered and questioned him eagerly 
but in vain 
he delighted in being asked but he would not tell 
d no no some time or other perhaps but not now 
he would mention no names now 
but such he could assured her had been the fact 
he had many years ago received inch 31 description of miss anne elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excited the warmest curiosity to know her 
nesrmsron 
1801 anyone could think of no one so likely to have kin with parting of her many year a o as the mr unworthy of onkford captain entworth’s brother 
he might have been in mr elliot s company but he had not courage to all the union

it had that appearance 
it seemed as if she had been one moment too late 
and as long as she dared observe he did not look again but the performance wan recommeneing and the vicar forced to seem to restore her attention to the oreheatra and look straight forward

to anyone it chieﬂy wore the prospect of an r of agitation 
she could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth once more without the interchange of one friendly look 
in re-eettling themaelvee there were now many changes the result of which was favourable for her 
colonel wallis declined setting down a n and mr elliot woe invited by elizabeth and mine regret in a manner not to be refuted to lit between them

where can you look for a more suitable match 
where could you expect a more gentlepersuasion 
30 i manlike agreeable nun 
let me recommend mr elliot 
i am sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel wallis 
and who can know him better than colonel wallis 
my dear mr smith mr elliot’s wife has not been dead much above half a ear 
he ought not to be so probed to be paying his addresses to on one 
half if these are your only objectionu cried mr 
smith archly 2 mr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him 
do not forget me when you are married that s all 
let him know me to be a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required which it is very natural for him now with many affair and engagements of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can 
very natural perhaps 
ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same 
of course he not be aware of the importance to me 
well my dear miss elliot i hope and trust you will be very happy 
mr elliot has lent to understand the value of such a woman 
your peace will not be uhinvreckcd as mine has been 
you are safe in all wo dly matters and safe in his character 
he will not be led stray 
he will not be misled by others to his ruin a 
no d said anne d i can readily believe all that of my cousin 
he teemto have a calm decided temper not at all open to dangerous impressions 
i consider him with great respect 
i have no reason from anything that ha 
fallen within my observation to do otherwise 
but i have not known him long 3 and he is not i man us i think to be known intimate soon 
will not this manner of speaking of him nlrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me 
surely this must be calm enough 
and upon my word he is nothing to me 
should he ever propose to me which i have we little reason to imagine he had any thought of doing

upon ending how much were together and feeling it to be the most pmbabremthing in the world to he wished for by everybody belonging to either of you

they were both silent if smith very thoughtful

i will only tell you what i have found him 
futihall lpenk 
he won the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him at good ii himnelf 
the intimacy had been formed before our marriage 
i mud t em most intimate friends 
and i too became executiver pleased with mr elliot and entertained the high opinion of him 
at nineteen on know one the 
not think ve teriounly 
but mr lliot n to toe quite ii at other 
and much more agreeable a l persuasion 
205 than most others 
and we were almost always either 
we were principally in town 
living in very atyle 
he war then the inferior in drcummacea 
he war then the poor one 
he had chamber in the temple and it was a match 
he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman 
he had always a home with us whenever he chose it 
he was always welcome 
he war like a brother 
my poor charles who had the nest moot l spirit in the world would have divided hide but farthing with him 
i know that he pnnewalopento him 
i know that he often united him a thin must have been about that very rod of mr elliot life laid anne which had ways excited my particular curioeity 
it must have been about the use time that he became known to my father and time 
i never knew him myself i only heard of him 
but there war a something in hell conduct then with regard to my father and peter and afterwards in the circumeuncel of lill mania e which i never could quite reconcile with present mr 
it ieemed to announce a different sort of man 
i know it all i know it all a cried mr smith 
a he had been introduced to sir walter and your deter before i was acquainted with him but i heard him speak of them for ever 
l know he war invited and encountered and i know he did not choose to go 
i can satisfy you chapel on points which you would little expect 
an as to hit marriage i knew all about it at the time 
i w pray to all the on and again 
i was the friend to whom he conned his hopes and plane 
and though i did not know his wife previourly her inferior situation in society indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards or at lent till within the last two years of her life and can lower an question you with to put nay a said anne d i have particular enquiry c :06 persuasion 
to make about her 
i have always understood were not i happy couple 
but i should like to know why at tint time of his life he should slight my father's acquaintance as he did 
my father certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him 
why did mr elliot draw back i d mr elliot a man smith 
at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by i rather quicker procethan the law 
he woe determined to make it by marriage 
he we 
determined at lent not to mar it by an impatient marriage 
and i know it was hi belief whether jury or not of course i can not decide that your father and cider in their civilities and invitation were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that ouch a match should have answered 
hi idea of wealth and indqlcndencc 
that wan his motive for drawing back i can name you 
he told me the whole story 
he had no concealment 
with me 
it was curious that having ust left you behind me in bath my first and prance acquintance on worrying should be your cousin 
and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister 
he described one miu elliot and i thought my all‘ectionately of the 
other 
perhaps a cried anne muck b a sudden idea you sometimes spoke of me to mr lliot 
to before i did 
very often 
i uncle to boat of my own anne elliot and vouching for your being a very different creature from 
d she checked herself in time 
this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night cried anne 
this explains it 
i found he had been mad to hear of me 
i could not come rehend how 
what wild in inaction one for w ere a dear self is concerned 
ow cure to be mistaken 
hang 
ily butlbeg ourpordon 
i have interrupted you 
mr elliot nunied then completely for money 
the circle probably which first opened your eyes to hicharacteri’ mn smith heitated 3 little here 
oh 
those thing are too common 
when one liver in the world a man or woman mnn'ying for money ll too common to strike one up it ought 
i wan very young and associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless y net without any strict ruler of conduct 
we lived or enjoy i think differently now 
time andiicknee and sorrow have given me other notions 
but at that i must own raw nothing reprehenlible in what mr elliot was doing 
to do the better himself passed at a duty 
a but was not the a re low woman 
d ye 
which 1 object to but he would not rid 
money matey wan all that he wanted 
her after me a brazier her grandfather hid been a butcher but that was all nothing 
she will a one woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliot company and fell in love with him 
and not a difficulty or a couple was there on his ride with respect to her birth 
all his caution was spent in being tenure of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himaelf.‘ depend upon it whenever eneem mr elliot may have for hit own situation in life now 
up a young mu he had not the urnalleet value for it 
hi chance of the well nch estate wan nothing but all the honour of the family he held at cheap 5 dirt 
i have often heard him declare that if baronctciea were miserable anybody should have hit for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included 
but i will not pretend to repeat halfthzt lunedto hear him my on that subject 
it would not be fair 
and yet you ought to have proof for 208 persuasion 
whet it all thin but tension and you shall have indeed my dear mr smith i want none cried anne 
you have needed nothing oonmdicto to what mr elliot appeared to be tome year ago 
1.lzhia in all in confirmation rather of what we need to hear and believe 
i am more curious to know why he ihould be no different now 
but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary 
stay i am mr you will have the mill greater goodnell of going yourself into my bedroom 
and bringing me the mall inlaid box which you will and on the upper shelf of the closet anne ieeing her friend to be ready bent on it did an the wan deoired 
the box we brought and placed before her and mr smith fighting over it up the unlocked it mid 
this in full of paperbelonging to him to my husband 
a wall portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him 
the letter i am looking for wan one written by mr elliot to him before our marriage and happened to be lived 
why one can hardly imagine 
but he was careful and immethodicnl like other men about these things 
and when i came to examine hie pit to i found it with other nil more trivial from di erent ple scattered here and there while many loner an memorandum of real irn romance had been destroyed 
here it in 
i would not burn it became being even then very little talked with mr elliot i was determined to pretend every document of former intimacy 
i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it 
thin wan the letter directed to charge smith

i happened to be at lyme 
a well a continued mrs smith trium hardly a grant my friend the credit due to the employment of the list point userted 
he aw you then at lame and liked you so well up to be exceedingly pleased to meet with us again in camden place as him anne elliot and ram that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visit there 
but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain 
if there in anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable into me 
my account am that your lim'l friend the lady now staying with you whom i haw heard ou mention came to bath with mine elliot and i walter so long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and ha 
been 2 l 2 pmasioii 
saying there ever iince

poor and plausible and altogetberwchinn'tnationlodmanner utogivea general idea among sir walner’a acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a that .1.elliot should he apparently blind to the dawn 
ere mn smith paused a moment 
hutannehad not a word to say and the continued 
this wan the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it 
and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be mild of it 
though he did not then wait in camden place 
but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that wan going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis nudged him acquainted with the appearance of things and the m beginning to prevail 
now you are to undermine tint time had worked a very material change in mr elliot’s opinion as to the value of a baronetcy 
upon all point of blood and complexion he in a completely altered man 
having long had an much man at he could tend nothing to with for on the de o avarice or indulgence he hat been gradually looming to pin he happened upon the consequence he in heir to 
i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it in now a confirmed feeling 
he can not beardxeideaofnotheing sir william 
you may guess therefore 
that the next he heard from his friend could not he very agreeable and you may guess what it produced 
the resolution of coming back to bath an won an public and of fixing himaclf here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the persuasion 
2 i 3 degree of his danger end of circumventing the lady if he found it material 
thin wi a upon between the two friend 
an the only thing to done 
and colonel wallis wan to unite in every way that he could 
he was to be introduced and my wallis war to be introduced 
and everybody wan to be introduced 
mr elliot came back aceordltgly 
and on application was forgiven us now admitted into the family 
and there it was his constant object and hit only oléjectvyill your arrival added another motive 
to watch if alter and my clay 
he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way 
all at all hours 
but i need not be particular on thin eubjecl you can imagine what an artful man would do 
and with thin e in perhaps my recollect what you have seen him a 
yet a laid anne b you tell me nothing which durst not accord with what i have known or could imagine 
there in alwayl oomething offensive in the detail of cunning 
the manoeuvre of eelliahnen and duplici must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprised me 
i know that who would be shocked by such a representations of mr elliot who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been ratified 
i have always wanted acme other motive for his conduct than appeared 
i should like to know his prevalent opinion a to the probability of the event he hat been in dread of 
whether he consider the danger to be evening or not 
learning i understand replied my smith 
a he think my clay afraid of him aware that he see through her and not daring to proceed at the might do in his absence 
but since he mun he been some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while the hold her present inﬂuence 
mr wallis hann amusing idea a nurse tell me that it ll to but i i

my line of conduct will be more direct 
mr elliot in evidently a ditingenuoun artiﬁcial world man who hat had never any better principle to go him than iclﬁnhneu.” but mr elliot wanot yet done with 
my smith had been carried away from her first direction and anyone had forgotten in the interest of her own family concern how much had been originally implied gained him 
but her attention was now called to the explanation ofthoee lint hints 
and ill listened to a recital which if it did not perfectly nullify the unqualiﬁed bitterness of my smith proved him to have been very unfeeling in hit conduct towards 
very deﬁcient both in justice and companion 
she learned that the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by mr elliot 1 marriage they had been a before always together and mr elliot had led hit friends into expentel much beyond his fortune 
my smith did not want to take blame to herself and we moot elder of throwing any on her husband 
but anne rmumon 
2 r s could collect that their income had never been elm to their style of living and that from the list there and been a great deal general and joint extravagance 
from his wife's account of him she could discern mr smith to have been a man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong understanding 
much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him led by him and probably despised him 
mr elliot 
raised his marriage to great fence and to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without 
involving himself for without his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man and beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend probableﬁnances but on the contrary had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the smiths accordingl had been mined 
the husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it 
hey had previously known embarrassment enough to try the friendship of their friends and to prove that mr elliot s had better not be tried 
but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known 
with a conscience in mr elliot’s regard more creditable to his feelings than his judgment mr smith had appointed him the executor of his will 
but mr elliot would not act and the difficulties and distressed which thin refusal had heaped on her in addition to the inevitable mutterings of her situation had been such a could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened to without corresponding indignation 
anyone was shown some letters of his on the occasion answers to urgent application from mrs smith which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and under a cold civility the name

thin was a cruel aggravation of actually utreightened menu

it war on this point that the had hoped to engage anne’s good nicely with mr elliot 
she had previously in the anticipation of their marriage been very ve of long her friend by it 
but on being mutedthathecouldhavemadenomemptofthat nature since he did not even know her to he in bath rnsussron

i while it took from her the new-found he of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left er at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way 
after listening to this full description of mr elliot anyone could not but express some surprise at mrs smith having spoken of him so favounbly in the beginning of their conversation 
d she had seemed to recommend and praise him i a cry dear c was mrs smiths reply there was nothing else to be done 
i considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet have made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him 
than if he had been your husband 
my heart bled for you as i talked of happiness 
and yet he is sensible he is agreesble and with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless 
he was very unkind to his first wife 
hey were wretched together 
but she was too mount and guide for respect and he had never love her 
i was willing to hope that you must re better 
v anyone could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed 
it was just possible that she might have been persuaded by lady russell 
and under such a sum upon which would have been most miserable in en time had disclosed all too late 
it was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived

1801 one went home to think over all that the had heard 
in anon her feeling were relieved by this know age of mr elliot 
there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him 
he stood opposed to captain wentworth in all hit own unwelcome obtrnl'veneu 
and the evil of his attention an night the immediate mischief he might hove done wan coincided with ienutiom un unlined nnperplexed 
pity for him wag all over 
but 31in wan the only point of relief 
in every other respect in looking round her or penetrating forward the now more to dim and to apprehend 
she was concerned for the disappointment and lady russell would be feeling 
for the mortiﬁcntionl which mun be hanging over her father and finer and had all the silent of freeing many evil without knowing how to avert any one of them 
she was most than ill for her own knowledge of him 
she had never considered himself at entitled m mud for not tlighting an old friend like mu smith but here war a reward indeed springing from it 
mrs smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done 
could the knowledge have been extended through her family 
but thin wan a vain idea she must talk to lady russell tell her con-alt eg

and quite painful to have him approach and speak their

in attentive deference to her father contrasted with his former language was obvious 
and when the thought of hit cruel conduct toward mn smith the could hardly hear the right of hi 
t limit and mild or the sound of his part cial good sentiments 
she meant to avoid any web alteration of manner as might provoke a remonttrance on his tide 
it war a great object with her to escape all en uiry or eclat 
but it was her intention to be at decided y cool to him an might be compatible with their relationihip

it was bad enough that a man clay should be always before her but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort

but mary could not bear to be left and had made herself i 
unhappy about it 
that for a day or two everything seemed to be in luepenle or at an end 
but then it had been taken up by hi father and mother 
his mother had some old friend in bath whom the wanted to see 
it war thought a good rtunity for henrietta to come and buy wedding other for herself and her tiller 
and in hurt it ended in being llll mother's retty that everything might be comfortable and eat to paint harville 
and he and mary were included in it by way of general convenience 
they had arrived late the night before 
my harville her children and captain benwick remained with mr mangrove and louisa at us return 
aunt only surprise was that affair thou d be in forwardneaa enough for henrietta’e wedding-cleaves to be talked of 
she had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as mute prevent the marriage from being near at hand

it would be unpardonable to fail 
we were asked on purpose to be introduced 
there was always s such a great connexion between the dalrymple and ourselves 
nothing ever happened on either side tint was not announced xmrnediately 
we are quite near relations you know 3 and mr elliot too whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with 
eve attention is due to mr elliot

i am not one of those who ne lest the reigning power to bow to the rising sun 
i 1 would not go for the sake of your father i should think it scandalous to go for the duke of his heir 
what is mr elliot tome 
2 the careless expression was life to anyone who saw that captain wentworth was all attention looking and listening with his whole soul 
and tin the last words brought is enquiringeyes from charles to herself 
charles and mary still talked on in the same style 
he half serious and hslfjesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she invariably serious rnon wannly opposing it and not fitting to make it known that however determined to go to camden place herself she should not think herself very well used if they went to the play without her 
mrs m rove interposed

how mortifying to feel that it was to

ca min wentworth wan acknowledged again by each y elizabeth more graciously then before 
she even addressed him once and looked at him more than once

after the water of a few minutes in laying the proper nothing the begin to give the invitation which was to comprine ill the remaining due of the mulgrovee

the truth was that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to under the importance of a manor luehan air and appearance ll hire 
the put was nothing 
the preterit waathat captain wentworth would move thou well in her drawtng-mom 
the card was pointedly given and sir walter and elizabeth arm and disappeared 
the interruption had been short though severe and eve and animation returned to foot of thee they left in the door that them out but not to anyone 
she could think only of the invitation the had with and amusement witnessed and of the manner in which it had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather than gratification of polite acknowledgment rather than acceptance 
she knew him the law again in bill 
eyes and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept inch an offering an an amusement for all the insolence of the past 
her spirit sank 
he held the card in hit hand after they were gone an if y considering it 
d only think of elizabeth including everybody i 
whispered mary very audihly 
d i do not wonder captain wentworth in delighted 
you tee he can not put the card out of hit hand 
anyone caught his eye law hii cheek

the party eeparaned 
the gentlemen had their own pupil the ladle proceeded on their own linen and they met no more while anne belonged to them 
she wan came-ﬂy begged to return and dine and give them all the rent of the day but her apin'ta had been so long exerted that at present the felt unequal to move and it only for home where he might be cure of being ii alert at she chose nonunion

they were reckoning him an certain but with her it was a grain tolicitude never appeared for ever minutes together 
he generally thought he would come because the generally thought he ought 
but it wan a case which the could not to shape into an poaitive act of duty or diacretion an inevitably to d the suggestion of very appetite feeling 
she only routed herself from the breeding of thin readers agitation to let mra clay know that the had been seen with mr elliot three hours after his being exposed to be out of bath for having watched in vain for name intimation of the interview from the lady herself the determined to mention it and it seemed to her that there was guilt in my clay'a face an the lichened

but anyone could imagine the read there the conecionaneal of hove in by aorne completion of mutual trick or come overbearin authority of he been obliged to attend perhaps or half an hour to his features and rentrictiona on her devignc on in walter 
she exclaimed 
however with a very tolerable imitation of nature

but a heartier interest had proceeded and the vicar 
now no little touched by mr elliot conduct except by in effect in one quarter that it became a matter of course the next morning ill to defer her explanatory vilit in riven street 
she had promised to he with the mutgmvea from breakfast to dinner 
her faith wan lighted

and there as they only paced the gradual ascent heedless of every group around them seeing neither sauntering politicians hustling housekeepers ﬂirting girls nor nurcery-mnids and children they could indulge in those retrospectionl and acknowledges and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the resent moment which were so poignant and so cases in interest

she had never been supplanted 
e never even believed himself to see her equal 
thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge that he had been content unconceiourly nay unintentionally 
that he had meant forget her and believed it to be done 
he had imagined himself indifferent when he had only been angry 
and he had been just to her america because he had been a murderer from them 
her character wan now fixed on his mind ii perfection itaelf maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness

ho can be in doubt of what followed 
when any two young people take it into their heed to marry they are pretty sure by perseverance to carry their point be they ever to poor or ever persuasion 
2 5 7 no imprudent or ever no little likely to be necessary to each other ultimate comfort 
thin ma be bad locality to conclude with but i believe it to truth 
and if such partiee aucoeed how ihould a captain wentworth and an anne elliot with the advantage of maturity of mind eon-domes of right and one independent fortune between them fail of bearing down every oppoi'tion 
they might in fact 
have home down a great deal more than they met with for there wan little to distress them beyond the want of gracioumeu and warmth 
sir walter made no objection and elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned 
ca tain wentworth with ﬁve-and-twenty thousand poun a 
and at high in hit profession ii merit and activity could place him wan no longer nobody 
he was now seemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish apendthrift bnronet 
who had not had principle or ienaeenough to maintain himself in the situation in which providence had laced him and who could give his daughter at peter t a small part of the ill 
of ten thousand pound which most be here hereafter 
sir walter indeed though he had no affection for anyone and no vanity battered to make him really ha on the occasion wan very far from thinking it a match for her 
on the contrary when he law more of captain wentworth taw‘him repeatedly b daylight and him well he was very much much by hi 
pon claims and felt that ill 
luperiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her iuperiority of rank 
and all this united by his welleounding name enabled sir walter at lot to both his pen with a very good grace for the iteration the marriage in the volume of honour 
the only one among them whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety wan lady russell 
anyone knew that lady russell must be iuﬂ'ering tome :58 nnsmsron

she loved anne better than the loved her own abrlirier 
and when the awkwardness of the beginning war over found little hardships in stanching herself up a mother to the man who no securing the bumping of her other child 
of all the family 
mary war probably the one foot immediately grid ed by the crrcumuanee 
it wan creditable to have n deter married and the might lower herself with having been grady inltnrrnental to the complexion by keeping anne with her in the autumn f and at her own litter must be better than her huahnnd’l alter it won very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than either clpmin benwick or persuasion

she hed something to lumber perhapu when they came into contact lglin 
in seeing anne restored to the rights of geniality and the mistress of a veryprettylnndaulette

anyone had no uppercrou hall before her no landed crate no heart p of e fmrily 
and if they could but keep captain entworth from being male i baronet he would not change situations with anne 
it would be well for the eldest limer if he were equally intieﬁed with her situation for a change is not very probable there 
she had noon the mortiﬁcation of seeing nb elliot withdraw and no one of proper condition ha since presented himself to nine even the unbounded hopewhich rank with him
