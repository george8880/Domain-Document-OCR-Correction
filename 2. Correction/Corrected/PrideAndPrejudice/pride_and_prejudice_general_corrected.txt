t is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife 
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well mixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered an the rightful property of come one or other of their daughters 
am dear mr bonnet said his lady to him one day 
have you heard that tethered park is let at 18 
mr bonnet replied that he had not

you must know that i am thinking of hit marrying one of them a it that his design in settling here

but 
it ll very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him at noon at he come i tree no occasion for that 
you and the girl may go or you may tend them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are at hand at any of them mr hindley might like you the best of the pony a my dear you flatter me 
i certainly but had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now 
when a woman has ever grown-up daughters the ought to give over thinking of her own beauti 10 2 n lock canes

i dare say mr bangle will beveryglad toss you

though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it wan what the expected all the while 
how good it wan in you my dear mr bonnet but i knew i should

7 chapter 31 
at all that mrs bereft however with the animals of her live daughters could ask on the subject war sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr dingy 
they attacked him in various ways 
with barefooted quinine ingenious nur positions and distant armies 
but he eluded the of them all and the were at lust obliged to ace t the second-hand intent fence of their neighbour l lucy 
her report was highly favourable 
sir will jam had been delighted with him 
he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party 
nothing could be more delightful 
to be fond of dancing wan a certain ate toward falling in love 
and very lively hopes of r bingley’l heart were entertained 
if i can but thee one of my daughters ha pilly settled at ethereal 
mid mrs bonnet to her but d a and all the other equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for 
in a few days mr burgled returned mr bonnets visit and cat about ten minutes with him in bill liberal 
he entertained hopes of being admitted to a leg of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much 
but he saw only the father 
the indies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of remaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse 
an invitation to dinner wan noon afterwards die 
parched 
and already had mrs bonnet planned the sinner that were to do credit to her house in when an answer arrived which deferred it all 
mr hindley wan obliged to be in town the following day and come pump and prejudice 
frequently unable to accept the honour of 
their invitation arc 
my bonnet wan quite disconcerted 
she could not imagine what business he could have in town on noon after his arrival in herefordshire 
and she began to fear that he might be always lying about from one place to another and never settled at tethered as he ought to be 
lad lucy quieted her fear a little by staring the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large part for the ball f and a report noon followed that mr being by wan to bring twelve ladies and even gentlemen with him to the assembly 
the girl grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only ax with him from london 
whine over letters and a cousin 
and when the party entered the next room it consisted only of over all together 
mr tingled his two avert the husband of the elder and another young man 
mr hindley was good-looking and gentlemanly 
he had a pleasant countenance and only unexpected manners 
his master were fine women with an air of decided fashion 
his brothers 
law mr hunt merely looked the gentleman 
but his friend mr darch noon drew the attention of the room by bit line tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which wall in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of hi having ten thousand years 
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a line figure of a man the ladies declared be war much handsomer than mr hindley and he wan looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manner gave a disgust which turned the tide o hire jocularity 
for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being placed 
and not all hit large came in derbylhire could then nave him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with hit friend 
pride and prejudice 
9 mr hindley had soon made himself acquainted with all the prize people in the room 
he was lively and unnerved need every dance was angry that the ball closed an earl and talked of loving one himself at netherlield 
such amiable p ties must speak for themselves 
what a contrast between him and his friend 
mr darch danced only once with mrs hunt and once with miss hindley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room king occasionally to one of his own party 
his thresher was decided 
he was the loudest root disagreeable man in the world and eve y hoped that he would never come there a agin 
amongst the most violent against him was mrs ernest who dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into clare resentment by his having blighted one of er daughters 
elizabeth bonnet had been obliged by the capacity of gentlemen to sit down for two races 
and during part of that time mr dairy had been mending near anon h for her to overhear s conversation between him and r hindley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it 
come darch said he i must have you dance 
i hate to see you mending about by yourself in thin stupid manner 
you had much the dance 
i certainly shall not 
you know how i bent it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner 
at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable 
your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with i would not be so fastidious as you are cried hindley 2 for a kingdom 
upon my honour i never met with so many peasant girls in my life as i have i 
b n 
pride and prejudicial 
this evening 
and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty 
stay are advancing with the only handsome girl in the room a said mercy looking at the eldest miss bonnet 
oh 
the is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld 
but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable 
do let me ask my partner to introduce a 
a which do you mean 
e and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said a she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt m and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to urge ladies who are slighted by other men 
you had otter return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me 
mr hindley followed his advice 
mr darch walked off 
and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him 
she told the story however with great grit among her friends 
for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in anything ﬁdlilc‘mou“ 3 th passed if l th the he evening to er s reason to whole family 
mrs net had seen beg eldest daughter much admired by the nethcrﬁeld party 
mr hindley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters 
jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way 
elizabeth felt james leisure 
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss angle as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood 
and catherine and ladies had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball 
they returned therefore in good spirits to alongside and prance l 
born the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants 
they found mr bonnet still up 
with a book he was regardless of time 
and on the resent occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to event of an evening which had raised luck insipid expccmiona 
he had rather hoped that all hit wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed 
but he soon found thathehadaverydiﬁerent itorytohear 
oh 
my dear mr kenneth as she entered the room 2 we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent hall 
i wish you had been there 
jane was so admired nothing could he like it 
everybody said how well she looked 
and mr single thought her unite beautiful and danced with her twice 
only ink of but my dear 
he actually danced with her twice 
and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time 
first of all he asked miss lucy 
i wusovexedtoseehim stand up with her 
but 
however he did not admire her at all 
indeed nobody can you know 
and he seemed quite struck with one as the was going down the dance 
so he inquired who she was and got introduced and asked her or the two next 
then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with marian lugs and the two with with jane again 
and the two sixth with drizzle and the boulanger.” d if he had had any compassion for use cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much for god s sake say no more of his partners 
o that he had spurned his ankle in the list dance i a job 
my dear continued mrs bonnet i am quite delighted with him 
he is so excessively handsome 
and his sisters are charming women 
i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses 
i dare lay the lace upon mrs hunt s gown 
— a 2 pride and prejudice here the wet interrupted again 
mr bonnet protested against my description of every 
she what therefore obliged to seek another branch of the object and related with much bitterness of it and tom exit relation the rocking tenets of r darch 
a ut i can more you the added that izz does not late much by not waiting infancy 
for he it a most disagreeably horrid man not it all worth pleading 
so highlands to conceited that there wit no enduring him 
e walked here and he walked there fancying himself to very great 
not handsomer enough to dance with 
i with you had been there m dear to have given him one of your tet-downt 
quite detect the man 
tbtpttt 117 
hen june and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautiously in her pain of mr hindley before expected to her titter how very much the admired him 
he it what a young men ought to be a said the table 
good-humoured lively 
and i never in 
such het pry manner 
to much eat with such perfect goodreedingl b c he it to handsome a replied elizabeth 
which i young man ought likewise to be if he putting can 
hit character it thereby complete i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time 
i did not expect such a compliment did not you 
i did for you 
but that it one great difference between it 
come diment always take you by surprise and me never 
hat could be more pride and prejudice 
3 natural than his asking you again 
he could not help seeing that you were about ever times a pretty as every 2 other woman in the room 
no thank his for that 
well he certainly is very agreeable and give you leave to like him 
you have liked many a spider person 
a dear dizzy i d 
oh 
you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general 
you never lee a fault in anybody 
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes 
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life i would wish not to be huts in enduring any one 
but i always speak what i think 
i know you do 
and it in that which makes the wonder 
with jaw good sense to be no honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candour in common enough 
one meet it eve here 
but to be candid without animation or i n 
to take the good of everybody character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone 
and so you like this manner sisters too do you 
their manner are not equal to his 
a certainly mob 
at link 
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them 
mim mingle in to live with her brother and keep his house 
and i am much mistaken if we shall not and a very charming ne hour in her 
elizabeth listen in silence but was not convinced 
their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general 
and with more quickness of observation and less privacy of temper than her sister and with i judgment too assailed by any attention to herself the was very little disposed to approve them 
they were in fact very fine ladies 
not 140 pride and prejudicial deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable when they chose it but mud and conceited 
they were rather handsome lied been educated in one of the list private ieminnriee in town had a fortune of twenty dimmed pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others 
they were of a respectable family in the north of england 
a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been at fired by trade 
mr magley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it 
mr magley intended it likewise 
and sometime made choice of his county 
but at he was now provided with n cod house and the liberty of i manor 
it was doubt us to man of those who best knew the confines of his temper w either he might not opened the remainder of hit day i at nedierﬁeld and leave the next generation to pure need 
hi 
linen were very anxious or hit having an mate of his own 
but though he was now established on as a tenant mice hindley wan by no mean unwilling to preside at his table 
nor was mr hum who had married a man of more fashion than fortune lea disposed to consider his house at her home when it united her 
mr hindley had not been of age two yearn when he was ten red b an accidental commendation to look at the old house 
he did look at it and into it for half 
hour 
was pleased with the situation and the principal room fatigued with what the owner said in in price and took it immediately 
a pride and prejudicial 150 between him and dry there was a ve steady friendship in spite of great s tone of c carter 
hindley wandered to fancy the cabinet pennies and futility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appealed dissatisfied 
on the strength of darch regard hindley had the insect reliance and of heu judgment the highest o onion 
in understanding dairy was the superior 
hindley was by no means deficient but darkly wan clever 
he was at the came time haughty renewed 
and insidious and his manners though we bed were not inviting 
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage 
hindley viii sure of being liked wherever he appeared dry was continually giving offence 
the manner in which they spoke of the mention assembly was sufficiently characteristic 
hindley had never met witadplemnter people or prettier girl in hit life 
every had been most kind and attentive to him 
there he been no formality no etilfneea 
he had soon felt acquainted with all the room 
and as to miss bonnet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful 
fancy on the contrary had been a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or plenum-e. miss bonnet he acknowledged to be retty but the smiled too much 
or 
hunt and her sister allowed it to be a 
but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of 
miss bonnet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authors by inch commendation to think of her as he chose 
6d pride and prejudice 
chance h 
thin 3 than walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bonnet were particularly intimate 
sir william lucre had been formerly in trade in hareton where he had made a tolerable fortune and rim to the honour of kent stood by an address to the king during his major try 
the distinction had perhaps been felt too ugly 
it had given him a doubt to his business and to his residence in a small market town 
and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a boon about a mile from mention denominated from that period lucy lodge where he could think with pleasure of hit own importance and unchecked by busiest occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world 
for though elated by hi 
rank it did not render him mpercilioua 
on the contrary he wee all attention to everybody 
by nature offensive friendly and obliging hire presentation at st. james had made him courteous 
lady lucy was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be i valuable ne hour to my bonnet 
the had several children 
e eldest of them a sepia les intelligent young woman about twenty-seven wan elizabethan intimate friend 
that the main lucerne and the mine bonnet did meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary 
and the morning after the enemy brought the former to longboum to hear and to communicate 
a tap began the evening well chariot laid bonnet with civil self-command to miss lucy 
a tap were mr bingluy’a 31st choice 2 yet 
but he seemed to like his second better 2 oh 
you mean jane i suppose because he danced pride and prejudice 
in withhertwice 
tobesurcthatﬂdseemasifhe admired her 
indeed i rather believe he rid 
i heard something about it 
but i hardly know what 
something about mr robinson 
perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson 
did not i mention it to you 
mr robinson asking him how he liked our melon trembles and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and whirl he thought the prettiest 
and his answering immediately to the last question 
oh 
the eldest miss bonnet beyond doubt 
there can not be two opinions on that pang upon my word 
well that was very decided indeed 
that does seem as if 
— 
but however it may all come to nothing you know 
a my overhearing were more to the purpose than you liza d said chariot 
mr fancy is not no well worth listening to as his friend is he i 
poor liza 
— 
to be only us tolerable 
i beg you would not put it into dizzy head to be vexed by his ill-treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite n misfortune to be liked by him 
mrs long told me last night that he not close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips 
are you note sure maharaj l 
— in not there a little mistake 
a said jane 
i certainly saw mr fancy no to her 
may 
because she asked him at last how he liked tethered and he could not help lowering her 
but the said he seemed very angry at being spoke to a mix hindley told me a card jane 
that he never walt 
much 
unless among hi intimate acquaintance 
it ellen he in remarkably agreeable 
i do not believe a word of it my dear 
if he 18 pride and prejudice 
had been so very agreeable he would have talked to my long 
but i can guess how it won 
everybody lays that he ll eat up with pride and i dare lay he had heard somehow that mr long does not keep ear 
rage and had come to the ball in a back chaise 
i do not mind his not talking to men on a laid mine lucy but i with he had danced with library another time dizzy aid her mother i would not dance with lain if i were you 
i believe ma'am i may wafer promise you never to dance with him 
a his pride a aid mix lucy does not offend no it much an pride often doe became there in an excuse for it 
one can not wonder that so very one a young man with family fortune everything in hit favour should think highly of himself 
if my 60 express it he has a right 
to be proud 
that in very true 2 replied elizabeth 
and i could easily forgive bai pride if he had not motioned me 
a pride observed mary who pictured himself upon the sublimity of her reflection 2 is a very common failing i believe 
by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it in very common indeed 
that human nature ll particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacent on the score of some quality or the other mul or imaginary 
vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used iy'nouymounl 
a person may be proud without being vain 
prism relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us 
if i were as rich at mr fancy a cried 31 young lucaarwho came with his sisters d i should not care how proud i wan 
i would keep a pack of foxhoondn and drink a bottle of wine every day pride and prejudice 
is then you would drink a great deal more than you on het said mrs bonnet 
and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly the boy protested that she should not 
the corn 
tired to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit 
hum h 
he ladies of longboum soon waited on those of tethered 
the visit was refuted in due form 
miss bonnets pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of mrs burst and miss hindley 
and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a with of being tear acquainted with than was expressed towards the two eldest 
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure 
but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them 
laugh their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother admiration 
it was generally evident whenever they met that he ll admire her 
and to bear it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the reference which she had begun to entertain for him am the first and was in a way to be very much in love 
but she considered with p ensure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great 
strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent 
she mention this to her friend miss lucy 
it may perhaps be pleasant replied chariot 250 pride and prejudicial 
to be able to impose on the public in such a clue 
but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded 
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it the may lose the opportunity of coaxing him 
and it will then be but r consolation to believe the world equally in the it 
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost eve attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freely 
a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have hurt enow h to be really in love without encouragement 
in one cases out o ten a woman had better show awn affection than she feels 
hindley likes our sister undoubtedly 
but he may never do more an like her if she does not help him once but she does help him on as much an her name will allow 
if i can receive her regard for him he must be a simpleton in need not to discover it too 
remember realize that he does not know jane distraction at you do but if a woman in partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must and it out 
perhaps a he must if he seen enough of her 
but though banged and jane meet tolerably often it in never for many hours together 
and an they always d see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in converting either 
jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention 
when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love ll much as she chooses 
your plan is a good one a replied elizabeth a where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married 
and if i were determined to get a rich zealand or any husband i dare say i should adopt it 
but these are not james feeling 
she is not acting by pride and prejudice 2 
design 
as yet she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness 
she has known him on a fortnight 
she danced four dances with him at eton 
she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times 
this is not quite enough h to make her understand his character 2 at as you represent it 
had she merely end with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite 
but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together 
and four evenings may do a great deal 
yes 
these four evening s have enabled them to certain that they both like injun better than commerce 
but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not ma ne that much has been unfolded 
a well said chair otter d i wish jane success with all my heart 
and if she were married to him to-morrow i should think she had as good s chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for s twelvemonth 
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance 
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or over so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the least 
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation 
and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life b you make me laugh chariot

that she hardly a good feature in her face than he began to it wan rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful

to thin discovery succeeded wick other equally mortifying

and in of hi asserting that her manner were mottoes of the fashionable world he was caught by their ears playfulness 
of thin the war perfectly unaware 
— to her he won only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with 
he began to with to know more of her and up a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with other 
he doing in drew her notice 
it was at sir william lucerne where a large party were assembled 
a what doer darch mean a laid he to marlott 2 by liking to my conversation with colonel former

a but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he ll about 
he hat a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him on his approaching them soon afterward though without teeming to have any intention of speaking mist lucy defend her friend to mention such a subject to him 
which immediately revolting elizabeth to do it iii the turned to him and ill a did not you think mr diary that i expressed myself uncommonly well june now when i was tearing colonel formed to give us i ball at merriman p pride and prejudice 2s

her performance was peeling though by no means capital 
after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded it the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for my

and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a nice air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached 
elizabeth easy and effected had been limed to with much more pleasure though not playing half no well 
and mary at the end of a long concern was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and rich airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the locket and two or three 249 pride and prejudicial 
officer joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room 
mr darch mode near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that sir william lucy wan his neighbour til sir william thus be an a what a charming amusement gear young people this is mr darch 
there in nothing like dancing after all 
i consider it as one of the cat refinement of polished societies 2 certainly sir 
and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world 
every savage can dance 
sir william only nailed 
a your friend perfume delightfully 2 he continued after a pause on seeing bringing join the group 
— 
2 and i doubt not that you are an ardent in the science yourself mr darch 
b you saw me dance at merriman believe sir 
yes indeed and received no considerable pleasure from the night 
do you often dance at st james 
a d never tire a do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place i 
it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it 
b you have a house in town i conclude 
a mr darch bowed 
i had once tome thoughts of king in town myself 
for i an fond of superior society 
but i did not feel unite certain that the air of low on would agree with and lucy 
e wanted in hopes of an answer 
but his companion was not disposed to make any 
and elizabeth at that infant moving toward them he was struck with the pride and prejudicial 
25 notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her 
a my dear miss size why are not you dancing 
— mr fancy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner 
you can not refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty in before you 
and taking her hand he would have given it to mr darch who though extremely surprise was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and laid with some diacornposure to sir william 
a indeed 
air i have not the least intention of dancing 
i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this wadding order to neighbor a partner 
r darch wi grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain 
elizabeth was determined 
nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion 
b you except so much in the dance minx realize that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you 
and though thin gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half-hour a mr fancy it all politeness said elizabeth smiling 
a he is indeed 
but considering the incitement my dear miss liza we can not wonder at his complaismoe 
for who would object to such a partner 
a elizabeth looked archly and turned away 
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with name complacency when thus accosted by miss hindley 
i can use the subject of your reverie a i should d ma ne not b you are considering how insupportable it would be ten-pins many evenings in this manner 
in such society

i have been meditating on the very great p came which a pair of line eying the face of a pretty woman can hector mind hindley immediately vexed her eye on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections 
mr darch replied with great in idiotcy

her father had been an attorney in hareton and had left her four thousand pounds 
shehadasisterman-ied to a mr pips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade 
the village of longbourn was only one mile from mention 
a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner shop us over the way 
the two youngest of the family hearing and ladies were particularly frequent in these attentions 
their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to hareton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening 
and however bare of news the country in her might be they always contrived to learn some worn their aunt at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a military regiment in the neighbourhood 
it s to remain the whole winter and hareton was the headquarters 
their visits to mrs lips were now produce of the most interesting intelligence 
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connection 
their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves 
mr pips visited them all and this opened to his niece a source of felicity unknown before 
they could talk of nothing but others 
and mr hindley 3 large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regiment of an assign

after listening one morning to their allusion on this subject mr bonnet coolly observed 
from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silent girls in the country 
i have inspected it some time but i am now convinced 
catherine was discovered and made no answer 
but india with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of ca train carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of 
the day a he was going the next morning to london 
d i am astonished my dear d said mrs kenneth that you should be so ready to think your own children silly 
if i wished to think slightingly of anybody s children it should note of my own however 
d if in children are silly 
i must hope to be always sensible o it ye 
but n it happens they are all of them very clever 
a this is the only point i fatter myself on which we do not agree 
i had hoped chit our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must to far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughter uncommonly foolish 
my dear mr bonnet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother 
when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do 
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well 
and indeed so i do still at my heart 
and if a smart young colonel with live or six thousand years should want one of my girl i shall not say nay to him 
and i thought colonel forester looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his regiments 
a mamma cried india 2 my aunt says that colonel faster and captain cancer do not go so often to miss pride and prejudice 
in watson as they did when they first came 
she sees them now very often standing in charles library 
my bonnet was prevented r l in by the entrance of the footman with a note for 11th bonnet

my bennct’u eyes sparkled with pleasure and she wo gale 
calling out while her daughter read

i wonder my aunt did not tell us of low 
a dining out a said mrs bonnet 2 that is very unlucky a can i have the carriage 
a said jane 
d no my dear ou had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain 
and then you must stay all i hit 
a hat would be a good scheme d said elizabeth a if you were sure that they would not over to send her home 
a oh 
but the demon will have mr dingley’a chaise to go to eton 
and the hunt have no one to theirs d i had much rather go in the coach 30 pride and prejudicial 
boom dear further can not quite horse i am sure 
they are wanted in the farm mr bonnet are not they 
“theyarewantedin the fannmmhoﬁeoerthanl can t umf 
a at if you have got them to-day 2 aid elizabeth a my other purposes will be answered 
he did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged 
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful yrognoeticof a bad day 
her however answered 
jane had not been gone long before it rained hard 
her bitten were weary for her but her mother woe delighted 
the rain 
continued the whole evening without intermission 
june certainly could not come back 
this wan a lucky idea of mine indeed l 2 mid my bonnet more than once n if the credit of making it rain were all her own 
till the next morning however the wan not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance 
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from tethered brought the following note for elizabeth 
my utter dizzy 
i and myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be in used to my getting wet through yesterday 
my kind render will not hear of my return home till i am better 
they insist also on my seeing mr jonek-therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me 
and excepting a tore-throat and headache there in not much the matter with me 
— your 6d. a well my dear d said mr bonnet 
when elizabeth had read the note aloud d if your daughter should have a dangerous lit of illness 
if the should die it would be pride and prejudice 
31 a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr tingled and under your order 
oh 
i am not at all afraid of her dying 
people do not die of little trying colds 
she will be taken good care of 
as long as she tea i there it is all very well 
i would go and see her if could have the carriage can elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had 
and as she was no kinswoman walking was her only attentive 
she declared her resolution 
a how can you be so silly cried her mother a as to think of such a thing in all this dirt 
you will not be lit to be seen when on get there 
i shall be very t to see jane 
which is all i want 
2 is this a hint to me izz said her father c to send for the horses 
a d no indeed 
i do not wish to avoid the walk 
the distance is nothing when one has a motive 
only three miles 
i shall be back by dinner a i admire the activity of your benevolence 2 observed mary 2 but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason 
and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what ll required 2 we will go as far as merry with you d said catherine and ladies 
elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together 
if we make haste d said liar as th walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter more he goes 
in me ton they 
the two youngest red to the diggings ofpbiiidof the officers wivleesfmand elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after old at a quick pace jumping over soles and springing over paddle with impatient activity and ending herself 120 pride and splendid 
at within view of the home with weary uncles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise 
she wan shown into the breakfahyarlour where all but jane were mumbled and where her appearance created i grunt deal of surprise 
that the should have walked three miles to early in the day in such dirty weather and herself was almost incredible to my hunt and mind hindley 
and elizabeth wan convinced that they held her in contempt for it 
she was received however very politely by them 
and in their brother manners there was something better than lines 
there wan good humour and kindness 
mr s laid very little and mr hunt nothing at all 
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt a. to the occasion mortifying her coming to far alone 
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast 
her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered 
mist bonnet had slept ill and though up wan very feverish and not well enough to leave her more 
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately 
and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expanding in her note how much the longed for much a visit was delighted at her entrance 
she war not a however to much conversation and when mind hindley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness the was treated with 
elizabeth silently attended her 
when breakfast wan over they were joined by the listen 
and elizabeth began to like them herself when she mew how much action and solitude they showed for jane 
the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to most sun summer 
31 get the better of it 
advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts 
the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely 
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentleman being out they had in fact nothing to do e somewhere 
when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that the must go and very unwillingly said so 
miss hindley opened her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testify red such concern in parting with her that miss hindley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at petersfield for the present 
elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longboum to acquiring the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes 
chapter 17 
t live o'clock the two ladies retired to dress and it half-past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner 
to the civil inquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr hindley's she could not make a very favourable answer 
jane was by no means better 
the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much the were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad no d and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves 
and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards june when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike 
149 pride and noble theirbrother indeed mstheonlyoneofthepnrty whom she could regard with my complacency 
his next for jane was evident and in 
attention 
to herself most pleasing 
and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed the was considered by the others 
she had very little notice from my but him 
miss hindley was engrossed mr dairy her sister scarcely lea so 
and as for mr am by whom elizabeth eat he was an indolent nun who lived only to eat 
drink 
and play at cards 
who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a gout had not to say to her 
hen dinner was over the returned directly to jane and miss hindley he an amusing her as soon as she was out of the room 
er manners were pronounced to be very had indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence 
she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty 
mrs burst thought the same and added a she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walked 
i shall never forget her up france this morning 
she really looked almost wi day she did indeed louisa 
i could hardly keep m countenance 
very nonsensical to come at all 
why must the be scram ring about the country because her sister had a cold 
er hair so untidy so blows d ye and her petticoat 
i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain 
and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office 
a your picture may be very exact louisa 2 laid bangle 
a but this was all lost upon me 
i thought mire lichen bonnet looked remarkably well when he came into the room this morning 
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice 
a tap observed it mr fancy i am sure a said pride and prejudice 
3 miss hindley 
e and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition 
a certainly not b c to walk three miles or four miles or ever miles or whatever it is above her acres in dirt and alone quite alone 
what could she mean by it 
it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country-town indifference to decorum 
a it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bind les 
i am afraid r barely observed miss hindley in a half whisper 2 that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her line eyes a not at all he replied 
a they were brightened by the exercises a short pause followed this speech and mrs burst began again 
— a i have an excessive regard for jane bonnet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settle ed 
but with such a father and mother and such low connection i am afraid there is no chance of it i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in hareton 
a yes 
and they have another who lives somewhere near chespside.” that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily 
if the had uncles enough to all all seaside 2 cried being by a it would not make them one jot less agreeable 
b c but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world a replied darch 
to this speech hindley made no answer 
but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their 16a earn ann prejudice 
mirth for tome time at the expense of their deer friend's vulgar relation 
with a renewal of tenderer however to her room on leaving the dining-parlour in eat 
with her till summoned to coffee 
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when the had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than permit that the should go downstairs herself 
on entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loop and was immediately invited to join them 
but suspecting them to be playing high the declined it and making her sister the excuse rapid the would amused herself for the short time she could any below with a book 
mr burst looked at her with astonishment 
a do you prefer minding to cards 
a laid he 
2 that ll rather singular minx liza bonnet d said mine single a despite card 
she is a got reader and has no pleasure in anything else li deserve neither such praise nor such ensure a cried elizabeth 
d i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things 
a in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure 2 mid hindley 
and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying 
he immediately offered to fetch her other that hit library afforded 
and i will my collection were larger for your bonnet and my own credit 
but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into 
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room 
none and prejudicial 
3 i am astonished d said miss hindley that my father should have left so small a collection of books 
what a delightful library you have at hatherley mr dare 10 d fell ought to be good he replied 
it has been the work of many generations c and then you have added so much to it yourself 
you are always buying books d i can not comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these 
a neglect 
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place 
charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful uz pemberley.” i wish it ma 10 but i would really advise you to make your purchases in that new boyhood and take temperly got a kind of mode 
there is not a line county in en land than derbyshire.” e with all my heart 
i will buy temperly itself if d will sell it 
am talking of possibilities charles 2 upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get temperly by purchase than by imitation 
elizabeth was so much can hit what passed as to leave her very little attention girl her book 
and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the charitable and stationed herself between mr hindley and his eldest sister to observe the game 
is miss darch much grown since the spring 
a said miss hindley 
will she be as tall as i am 
a d i think she will 
she is now about miss elizabeth bonnets her hat or rather taller how i me to see her again 
i never met with anybody who delighted me so much 
such n countess pin 
inn prejudicial 
once such manners 
and is ready new for her age 
her performance on the is quuilite.’ 2 it in amazing to me a aid hindley chow young ladies can have pariencetoheloveryaocompliahed they all are a all young ladies accomplished 
my dear charles what do you mean 10 ye all of them i think 
they all paint tables cover keen and net pure 
i scarcely know any one who can not do all thin and i am sure i never hard a young lady spoken of for the in time without being informed that the was very accomplished 
your list of the common extent of accomplishments d said darch has too much truth 
the word in applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by letting purse or covering a tureen 
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your intimation of ladies in general 
i can not bout of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accord lined for l i am sure a maid mice magley 
a then observed elizabeth b you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman 
yes i do comprehend a great deal in it 
oh 
certainly a cried his faithful assistant no one can be rally esteemed accomplished who does not greatly aux-peas what in usually met with 
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word 
and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the one of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved 2 all thin the must possess a added fancy a and m pride and prejudice 30 all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading 
i am no longer surprised at your knowing any six accomplished women 
i rather wonder now at your knowing my care you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this is i never saw such a woman 
i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united 
mrs burst and miss hindley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that th knew many women who answered this description w en mr burst called them to order with bitter complaints of their attention to what was going forward 
as all conversation was thereby at an end 
elizabeth soon afterwards left the room 
felix bonnet d said miss bringing when the door was closed on her 2 is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the order sex by undertaking their own 
and with many men i dare say it succeed 
but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art 
a undoubtedly 2 replied dared to whom this remark was chiefly addressed 2 there is madness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for cultivation 
whatever bears affability to cunning is d icahle.” in hindley was not so entirely satisfied with this mph as to continue the subject 
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not lave her 
bit key urged mr jones being sent for immediately 
while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians 
this so pride all 
pending 
would not hear of 
butthewat not to unwilling to comply with their brother proposal 
and it was settled that mr alone should be tent for early in the skimming 
if mist bonnet were not decidedly better 
hindley was quite uncomfortable 
his linen declared that there miserable 
they placed their wretchedness however by doubts after supper while he could and no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every mention might be paid to the tick lady and her finger 
hum 3 
elizabeth poured the chief of the night in her sister room and in the morning had the league of being able to tend a tolerable answer to the inquiries which the very early receive from mr hindley by n housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his fingers 
in spite of this amazement however she required to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation 
the note wan immediately dispatched and its contents at quickly complied with 
mrs bonnet accord iced h her two pungent girls reached ethereal soon a r the family y breakfast 
had she found lane in any apparent danger bonnet would have been very juvenile 
but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from tethered 
she would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried home 
neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think pride and prejudice 
4 
it at all advisable 
after sitting a little while with jane on miss hindley s appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour 
hindley met them with hopes that mrs bonnet had not found miss bonnet worse than she expected 
a indeed i have sir a was her answer 
d she is a great deal too ill to he moved 
mr jones says we must not think of moving her 
we must trespass a little longer on our kindness 
removed cried hindley 
it must not be thought of 
my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal you may de d upon it madam 
said miss bangle with cod civility that miss bonnet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us mrs bonnet was profuse in her acknowledgment 
i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and sullen a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with 
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to bar 
you have a sweet room here mr hindley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk 
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to tethered 
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short least a whatever i do is done in a hurry a replied he 
and therefore if i should resolve to quit tethered i should bath be of 
in over minutes 
at present however i consider myself as quite vexed here 
that is exactly what i should have supposed of you d said elizabeth 
l. d 421 pride and prejudicial b you begin to comprehend rue do you 
a cried he turning towards her 
a oh 
yes 
i understand you perfectly 
i wish i might take this for a compliment 
but to be no easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful 
that is as it happens 
it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less desirable than such a one as yourself a lazy 2 cried her mother a remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home i did not know before a continued hindley immediately 2 that you were a student of character 
it must be an amusing study a yes but intricate characters are the mud 
amusing 
the have at least that advantage 
a he country d said darch can in general supply but few subjects or such a study 
in a country neighborhood you move in a very confined and unvarying locket 
a ut people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever yes indeed a cried mrs bonnet ol'l'ended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood 
i none you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town everybody was surprised and dry after looking at her for a moment turned silently away 
mrs m who fancied she had gained a complete victory w him continued her triumph 
is 10 mim see that london has any got advantage 
a the country for my part except the shops and w due 
he country is a vast deal pleasanter is he r dingy 
g i an in the country 2 he replied a i never a. by it 
and when i am in town it pretty pride and prejudice 
421 much the same 
they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either a ay 
that is because you have the right disposition 
but that gentleman 2 looking at dairy seemed to think the country was nothing at all 
indeed mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother 
you quite mistake mr darch 
he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to he met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true 
certainly my dear nobody said there were 
but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhood larger 
i know we dine with four-and-twenty families nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable hindley to keep his countenance 
his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards mr dry with a very expressive smile 
elizabeth for the wake of saying something that might turn her mother thoughts now asked her if chariot lucy had been at longboum since barer coming away 
a yes she called yesterday with her father 
what an agreeable man sir william is mr dingy 
is not he 
so much the man of fashion 
so genteel and so gal 
he has always something to say to every 
— that 
is my idea of good breeding 
and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths unite mistake the matter 
a did chariot ne with you 
d no she would go home 
i fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies 
for my part mr hindley i always keep servants that can do their own work 
my daughters are brought up differently 
but everybody is to judge for themselves and the cases are a very good sort of girls i assure you 
it is a pity they are 4d rain sun inhuman 
not handsome 
not that i think marlott in very plain 
but then she is our particular friend she seems a very pleasant young woman d said hindley 
oh 
dear yer 
but ou must own the is very plain 
lady lucy hers has often said so and envied rue james beauty 
i do not like to boat of my own child but to be sure jane 
one does not often see anybody better looking 
it is what everybody says 
i do not trust my own vitality 
when she was only after there was a entieamnn at my brother gnrdiner’e in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away 
but however he did not 
perhaps he thought her too young 
however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were and so ended lull section 2 mid elizabeth impatiently 
there ha been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way 
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love 
a d i have been used to consider poetry at the food of love a said darch 
of a one stout healthy love it may 
everything nourished what is strong already 
but if the only a slight thin sort of inclination am convinced that one good bonnet will starve it entirely away darch on smiled 
and the general paul which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again 
she lone ed to speak but could think of nothing to say 
and a tear a short silence mrs bonnet began repeating her thanks to mr hindley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with dizzy 
mr hindley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required 
she performed her part indeed without much gracious pride and grinding 4d but my bonnet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage 
upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward 
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr bangle with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a hall at nether-ﬁeld 
dial was stout weed-grown girl of fifteen with a one complexion and good-humoured countenance 
a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age 
she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural self-consequence which the attentions of the faces to whom her uncle good dinners and her own easy manner recommended her had increased into assurance 
she was very us therefore to address mr hindley on the subject of the ball and w reminded him of his promise 
adding that it d he the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it 
his answer to this sudden amuck was delightful to her mother r 
d i am perfectly ready i assure you to in my engagement 
and when your sister is recoil on shall if you please name the very day of the ball 
get you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill india declared herself ant led 
oh yes 
it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at sherton again 
and when you have given your ball d she added i shall insist on their giving one also 
shall tell colonel forester it will be quite a shame if he does not mrs bonnet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darch 
the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their centre of her in spite of all miss hindley's criticisms on here yer

mr hunt and mr tingly were at pills and my hum was observing their game 
elizabeth took up some needle-work and was izﬂicienlly amulet in intending to what rolled between dairy and his companion 
the perpetual commendation of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evening of his linen or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her pain were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each 
a how delighted minx darch will be to receive such a lam 
he made no answer 
b you write uncommonly fan 
b you are mistaken 
i write rather slowly 2 how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year 10 letters of business too 
how odious i should think them s 
a it is fortunate then that they fall to my 10 instead of to ours

d i have already told her so once by your desires d i am afraid you do not like your let me mend it for you 
i mend pens rermrkab y well pride and prejudice 
4 d thank you 
but i always mend my own a how can you contrive to write so even i he was silent 
a tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp 
and pray let her know that i am quite in rapture with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley’s.” will you give me leave to defer your rupture till i write again l at present i have not room to do them justice 
a h 
it is of no consequence 
i shall see her in january 
but do ou always write such charming long letters to her mr am i d they are general y long 
but whether always charm it is not for me to determine 2 it is a rule with me that a person who can write 3 iron letter with ease can not write till a what will not do for a compliment to fancy caroline 2 cried her brother 
s because he does no 
write with ease 
he studies too much for words of four syllables 
do not you fancy 
a my style of writing is very different from yours 
a oh 
cried miss single a charles writes in the most careless way imaginable 
he leaves out half his words and blots the rest 
my ideas now so rapidly that i have not time to express them 
say which means my letters sometimes convex no ideas at all to my correspondent 2 your humility mr single a said elizabeth a must disarm reproof 
a nothing is more deceive a said fancy a than the race of humility 
it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast 
and which of the two do you call in little recent piece of modesty 
4 some any prentice 
the indirect boast 
for you are really proud of your defects in writing 
because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and careless of execution which if not stable you think at least highly interesting 
the power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the r and often without an attention to the m too of the performance 
hen you told mrs met this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting tethered you should be gone in over minutes you want it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself 
and yet what is there so very audible in a precipice which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else 
nay a cried hindley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning 
and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment 
at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitancy merely to show at 
before the ladies d i dare say you believed it 
but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such severity 
your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know 
and if as ou were mounting your horse a friend were to say a angle you had better stay till next week b you would probably do it you would probably not go 
and at another word might stay a month you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr hindley did not do justice to his own dis position 
you have shown him off now much more than he did himself i am exceedingly granted a said single a by your converting what my friend sat s into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper 
ut i am afraid you pride and prejudice 
149 are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend 
for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a cat denial and ride of as fast as i could would mr darch then consider the rashness of your original intention as owned for by your obstinacy m atheling to it 
a 
upon my word i can not exactly explain the matter 
fancy must speak for himself b you ax t me to account for opinions which you chose to call mine but which i have never acknowledged 
allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bonnet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the deal of his plan has merely desired it asked it without o bring one argument in favour of its propriety to yield readily 
hastily 
w the german m of a friend is no merit with you a t n yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either b you appear to me mr dared to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection 
a regard for the request would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it 
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as on have supposed about r being by 
we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon 
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to he argued into it 
a will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree s pride and prejudice 
of importance which is so splendid to this net as well this as the degree of intimacy assisting weaken the parties 10 b c by all means a cried hindley 
let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size 
for that will have more weight in the argument miss bonnet than you may be aware of 
i assure you that if dairy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference 
i declare i do not know a more awful object than darch on particular occasions and in particular places 
at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do mr darch smiled 
but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh 
miss hindley warmly resented the dignity he had received in an expostulating with her brother for talking such nonsense 
d i see your design jingled said his friend 
— b you dislike an argument and want to silence this 
a perhaps i do 
arguments are too much like disputes 
if you and miss bonnet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful 
and then you may say whatever you like of me a what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side 
and mr dairy had much better laid his letters mr darch took her advice and did punish his letter 
when that business was over he applied to miss hindley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music 
miss hindley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte 
and after a polite request that elizabeth would lad the way which the other as likely and more earnestly negatived she tied herself 
of mrs burst sang win her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as pride and prejudice 
s 
she turned over some music-book that lay on the instrument how free urgently mr darch eyes were fixed on her 
she ha y knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to no great a man 
and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange 
she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there wax is something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other soon present 
the supposition did not pain her 
she liked him too little lo care for his approbation 
after playing some italian songs miss hindley varied the charm by a lively scotch air 
and soon afterwards mr darch drawing near elizabeth aid to her 
do not you feel a great inclination miss bonnet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel 
she smiled but made no answer 
he repeated the question with some sup rise at her silence 
oh 
a said she d heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to lay in reply 
you wanted me i know to say a yes 2 that on might have the pleasure of desiring my taste 
but always delight in overflowing those kind of schemes and cheating a n of their unpremeditated contempt 
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all 
and now despise me if you dare 2 indeed i do not dare elizabeth having rather expected to adroit him was amazed at his gallantry 
but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult or her to adroit anybody 
and fancy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her 
he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connection he should be in some danger 2 hid

a you used no abominable ill 2 answered mrs hunt a running away without telling us that you were coming out 
pride and prejudice 
if then taking the disengaged arm of mr dairy she let elizabeth to walk by herself 
the path admitted three 
mr darch felt their rudeness and immediately said 
a this walk is not wide enough for our party 
we had better go into the avenue but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughing answered 
d no no

you are charmingly grouped and up r to uncommon advantage 
the picturesque wo d be spoilt by admitting a fourth

by she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two 
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening 
chapter i 
hen the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing-room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure 
and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared 
their powers of conversation were considerable 
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and lay h at their acquaintance with spirit 
ut when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object 
miss hindley's eyes were instantly turned towards dairy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many 4 pride and prentice 
steps 
he addressed himself directly mill bonnet with a polite congratulation 
mr umf also made her a slight bow and said he was a very glad 2 but dilliiseness and warmth remained for hindley's salutation 
he was full of by and attention 
the first half-hour was spent in piling up the free lest she should suffer from the change of room 
and she removed at his desire to the other side of the place that she might be further from the door 
he then r. down by her and talked scarcely to any one else 
elizabeth at work in the opposite comer w it all with great delight 
when tea was over mr hum reminded his sister-in-law of the charitable 
but in vain 
she had obtained private intelligence that mr darch did not wish for cards 
and mr burst soon found even his open petition rejected 
she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her 
mr hours had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the slopes and go to sleep 
fancy took up a book 
miss hindley did the same 
and mrs burst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss bonnet 
miss bind eley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching air darch progress through bai book as in reading her own 
and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page 
she could not win him however to any conversation 
he merely answered her question and read on 
at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said a how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way 
i declare after all there is no enjoyment like hams and pnnmnrcn 
as reading 
how much sooner one wires of anything than of a book l 
when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library no one made any reply 
she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest 
of some amusement 
when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bonnet she turned suddenly towards him and said 
by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherlield 
— i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party 
i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure 
if you mean arc 2 cried her brother he may go to bed if he curses before it begins 
hut as for the ball it is quite a settled thing 
and as soon as chills has made while soup enough i shall send round my cardew i should like balls infinitely better d she replied if they were carried on in a different manner 
but there is something insulfcmbl tedious in the usual process of such a meeting 
t would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day a much more rational my dear caroline i dare by but it would not be near so much like a ball 
miss hindley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room 
her figure was elegant and she walked well 
— 
but diary at whom it was all aimed was still indelibly studiously 
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said 
a miss liza bonnet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room 
— l assure 60 mien and pncmnrcc 
you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately 
miss tingly succeeded no less in the real object of her civility 
mr darch looked up 
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book 
he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere 
what could he mean 
she was dying to know what could be his meaning 
— and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him 
not at all a was her answer 
but depend upon it 
he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it 
miss hindley however was incapable of dip hinting mr diary in anything and persevered there are in requiring an explanation of his two motives 
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them a said he as soon as she a lowed him to speak 
you either chase this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking 
— if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the free 
oh 
shocking 
cried miss hindley 
i never heard anything so abominable 
how shall we punish him for such a speech 2 
nothing so ca if you have but the inclination d said elizabeth 
a e can all plague and punish one pride and prejudice another 
tease him 
laugh at him 
intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done but upon my honour i do not 
i do aware you that my intimacy has not yet taught me but 
tease calmness of temper and presence of mind 
no no 
i feel he may defy us there 
and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you lease by attempting to lay h without a subject 
r diary may hug himself 10 2 mr fancy is not to be laughed at 
cried elizabeth 
that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would he a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance 
i depart love laughed his jingled said he d has given me credit for more than can be 
the wisest and the best of men 
my the wisest and best of their actions 
quarry be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke certainly a replied elizabeth 
a there are such people hut hope i am not one of men 
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good 
follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies la driven me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can't these i suppose are precisely what you are without 
perhaps that is not possible for any one 
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding lo ridicule 
such as vanity and pride a yew vanity is a weakness indeed 
but pride 
where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation e elizabeth turned away to hide a smile 
your examination of mr fancy is over i presume d said miss hindley 
and pray what is the result 
i 
l 18 pride and prejudice 
i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darch has no defect 
he own it himself without disguise anon 
said darch d i have made no such pretension 
i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding 
my temper i dare not vouching for 
it is i believe too little yielding 
certainly too little for the convenience of the world 
i can not forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself 
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them 
my temper would perhaps s be called resentfully 
— 
my good opinion once lost is out for ever 
that is a failing indeed 
— cried elizabeth 
implacable resentment i a shade in a character 
but you have chosen your fault well 
i really can not long at it 
you are safe from me there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil 
a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome c and your defect is a propensity to hate everybody c and yours 2 he replied with a smile dis wilfully to understand them do let 
us have a little music cried miss hindley tired of a conversation in which the had no share 
a louisa you will not mind my waking mr burst 
a her sister made not the smallest objection and the pinafore was opened 
and dry after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it 
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention 
pride and prejudice 9 hum of 
n consequence of an agreement between the listen elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage wi t be sent for them in the course of the day 
but fell s bonnet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at tethered till the following tunes which would exactly banish james week could not ring herself to receive them with pleasure before 
her answer therefore was not propositions at least not to elizabeth wishes for she was impatient to get home 
mrs bonnet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday 
and in her outstript it was added that if mr hindley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well 
a just staying longer however elizabeth was snivel 
l resolved 
nor did the much expect it you d be asked 
and fearful on the contrary it being considered as intruding themselves endlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr binglcy’s carriage immediately and it was at length settled that their original design of leaving tethered that morning should be mentioned and the re nest made 
the communication excited many professions of concern 
and anon h was said of wishing them to stay at least till the far lowing day to work on jane 
and till the marrow their going was deferred 
miss hindley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other 
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss kenneth that it would not be safe for her 
that she was not enough recovered 
but jane was farm where she felt herself to be right 60 ran and practice 
to mr fancy it was welcome intelligence 
elizabeth had been it tethered long enough 
she rammed him more than he liked 
and mind hindley mundvilm‘er lend mommingehanusualrohimiell 
he wisely resolved to be particularly career in no ognor admiration should jump him 
nothing that could elevate her with the hope of inducing mercury

and though they were at one time left by themselves for half

and would no even look at her 
on sunday after morning service the reparation 
to be to almost all tool plane 
mine bingley‘l civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane 
and when they parted after staring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to ace her either at longboum or tethered and embracing her most tenderly the even hook hand 
i 
the former 
elizabeth tool leave of threshold pan in the lively spirits 
they were not welcomed home very cordially by mr mother 
my bonnet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again 
but “gigfather thou h very laconic in his expressions of man was real y glad to see them 
he had felt their once in the family circle 
the evening convention when they were all assembled had lost much of in animation and almost all its sense by the absence of and elizabeth 
they found mary as usual deep in the study of much has and human nature 
and had come new arm and pnejumcs

much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the receding wednesday

chapter 31 
a hope my dear d said mr bonnet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning 2 that you have ordered a good dinner to-day because i have reason to expect an addition to our family 5th 17 pauywho do you mean my dear 
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless chariot lucy should happen to call in 
and i hope my dinners are good enough for her 
i do not believe she often sees such at home 
2 the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger mrs bonnets e s sparkled 
a gentleman and a stranger 
it is hindley i am sure 
why jane 
— you never do t a word of this 
you sly thing 
well i am sure shall be extremely glad to see mr hindley 
— but 
good lord 
how unlucky 
there is not a bit of cash to be got to doze 
ladies glove ring the bell 
i must speak to hi 
this moment it is not mr single a said her husband 
a it is green whom i never saw in the whole course of my i this roused a general astonishment 
and he had the o me mr prejudice 
pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and live caught at once 
after musing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained 
about a month ago i received this letter 
and shoot a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention 
it is from my cousin mr colling who when i an dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he lent a oh 
my dear 2 cried his wife i can not bear to hear that mentioned 
pray do not talk of that odious man 
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children 
and i am sure if i had been you i should lure tried long ago to do something or other about it 
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entrails 
they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which my bonnet was beyond the reach of reason and the continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of live daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about 
a it certainly is a most ubiquitous affair a said mr bonnet and nothing can clear mr cousins from the guilt of inhabiting longboum 
but if you will listen to his lever you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself no that i am sure i shall not 
and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical i hate such false friends 
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did infuse him i d why indeed 
he does seem to have had some half temples on that head as you will hear mops and summer 
by a uniform near western kent d i 5th october 
dean is 4 the disagreement subsiding between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach 
but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectfully to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at parlance 
— a there mrs bonnet 
my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the parsonage of the right honourable lady catherine de ought widow of sir louis de bough whose bounty and benevolence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demand myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to form those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england 
as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promise and establish the blessing of peace in 10 families within the reach of my innocence 
and on these grounds i fatter myself that my present adventures of good-will are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the tail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch 
i can not be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amend 
hut of this hereafter 
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself f the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november 18th by four o'clock and shall 6d mops and prejudicial probably trespass on you hospitality till the saturday sunlight following which can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objection to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day 
— i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your well-wisher and friend william colling at four o'clock therefore we ma expect this peace-making gentleman said mr nest as he folded up the letter 
a he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to eat him come to us again a there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him 
though it is difficult d said jane c to guess in what way he can mean to make us the torment he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required he must be an oddly i think said she 
i can not make him out 
there is something very pompous in his style 
— and what can he mean by apologise for being next in the until i 
we can not suppose he would help it if he could 
— can he be a sensible man air 3 b c no my dear 
i think not 
i have great hopes of sending him quite the reverse 
there is a mixture of severity and self-importance in his letter which promises well 
i am impatient to see him 
moves me prejudice 
be in not of como lion said this letter does notpgleem permits 
the idea omolive-bmch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well ax dressed of catherine and ladies neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting 
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour 
as for their mother mr colling letter had done away much of her ill-will and she was preparing to see him with i degree of composure which finished her husband and daughters 
mr colling was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family 
mr bonnet indeed said little 
but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr colling seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself 
he was a nil mean-looking young man of five-and-twenty 
his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal 
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bonnet on having so once a family of daughters 
said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short 
of the truth 
and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage 
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers 
but mrs bonnet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily 
b you are very kind i am sure 
and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be estimated enough 
things are settled so oddly 
b c ou allude perhaps to the tail of this estate aah 
sir i do indeed 
it is s grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess 
not that i mean to and fault with joy for such things i know are all chance 6d pride and prejudicial 
in this world 
there is no knowing how elated will go when once they come to be entailed i am very amiable madam of the hardships to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate 
but i can atone the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them 
at present i will not say more 
but 
perhaps when we are better acquainted 
a he was interrupted by a summons to dinner 
and the girls smiled on each other 
they were not the only objects of mr colling admiration 
the hall the dining-room and all its furniture were examined and pricked 
and his commendation of everything would lure touched my bonnet heart but for the mortifying apparition of his viewing it all as his own future property 
the dinner too in its turn was highly admirable 
and he wagged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cooking was owing 
but he he was net right by mrs bonnet who insured him with some aspect that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen 
he begged pardon for having displeased her 
in a softening tone the declared herself not at all offended 
but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour 
¢bnpttr 117 
during dinner mr bonnet scarcely spoke at all 
but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very minute in his patron 
lady catherine de bought mops and prejudicial 
by attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable 
mr bonnet could not have chosen better 
mr colling was eloquent in her praise 
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that 
he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank 
such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine 
she had been ungraciously pleased to approve of both the discoveries which he had already had the honour of preaching before her 
she had also asked him twice to dine at musings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening 
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many pool i he knew but be had never seen anything but liii it in her 
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman 
she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations 
she had even condescend to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion 
and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and ha even vouchsafed to suggest some herself 
some shelves in the closet upstairs 2 that is all very proper and civil i am mire 
said mrs bonnet c and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman 
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her 
does she live near you sir i 4 the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from roarings park her ladyship residence d i think you said she is a widow sir 
has she any family i 
6d pride and prejudice 
d she has one only daughter the veil of rotting 
and of very extensive property 2 all a cried my bonnet shaking her head then she in better off than many girls 
and events sort of young lady is the 
is she handsome i d a she is a most charming young lady indeed 
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty minx de bought it far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which margin the young woman of distinguished birth 
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in man accomplishments which she could not otherwise have aided of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them 
but she is perfectly amiable and often condescend to drive by my humble abode in her little paw and ponies 
a hat she been presented 
i do not remember her name among the ladies at council there indifferent state of health unhappily prevent her being in town 
and by that means as i to d lady catherine myself one day has de arrived the british court of its brightest ornament 
her ladyship seemedpleased with the idea 
and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate camp mental which are always acceptable to ladies 
i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her 
— these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it in a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay 
you judge very properly d said mr bonnet and it in happy for you that you possess the talent of fatter 
in with delicacy 
may i ask whether these pleasing pride and women 
6d attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study 
a they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as studied an air as possible 
mr bonnets expectations were fully answered 
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no other in his pleasure 
tea-time however the dose had been enough and mr kenneth was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies 
mr colling readily assented and a book was produced 
but on beholding it for everything announced it to he from a circling library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels 
fifty stared at him and ladies exclaimed 
other books were produced and after some desperation he chose forceps sermons 
ladies gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with 
a do you know mamma that my uncle uphill talks of turning away richard 
and if he does lonely former will hire him 
my aunt 
told me so herself on saturday 
i shall walk to mention to-morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr deny comes back from town dial was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue 
but mr colling much offended laid aside his book and said 
— i have often observed how little young ladies are do pride and pr'iiudici 
interrupted by hooked a serious camp though written offer for their bent 
it makes me i comical 
— for certainly there can be nothing so admtageoua to them it instruction 
but i will no longer importuned my young cousin 
then turning to mr bonnet 
he offered himself it hit antagoan at backgammon 
mr bonnet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wine in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusement 
in bonnet and her daughter apologized coat civilly for dial interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would rear his book 
but mr calling after assuring them that he bore hit young could no ill-will and should never relent her behaviour any affront routed himself at another table with mr bonnet and prepared for backgammon 
ahem 117 
r colling was not a terrible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little actuated by education or society 
the greater part of m life having been spent on er the guidance of an illiterate and misery father 
and though he belonged one of the univeraiu'ea he had merely kept the necessary warmed without forming at it any useful acquaintance 
lie subjection in which his father had brought him up ll given him originally great humility of manner 
but it ve now a good deal counter-acted by the self-deceit m a weak head living in retirement and the consequence twinkling of early and unexpected prosperity 
a minute chance had recommended him to lady \‘wlhm‘ne de bough when the living of hereford was new 
i and the respect which he fell t for her high rank 7s pride and prejudice 
mrs bonnet treasure up the hint adjusted that she might soon have two daughter married 
and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces 
ladies s intention of walking to hareton was not forgotten 
every sister except mary agreed to go with her 
and mr colling was to attend them at the request of mr bonnet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself 
for thither mr colling had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominal engaged with one of the largest flies in the collection but really talking to mr bonnet with little cessation of his house and garden at hereford 
such doings discompose mr bonnet exceedingly 
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity 
and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there 
his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr calling to join his daughters in their walk 
and mr colling being in fact much better fitted for a walk than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go 
in pompous nothing on his side and civil ascent on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered merriman 
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by link 
their eyes were immediately wandering it in the street in quest of the others and nothing can than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recall them 
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanly 2 parlance walking with an office on the other side of the way 
the office was the very mr deny concerning whose return from london pride and prejudicial 
7 
and hit veneration for her as his partner mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and hill right a a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obeequiousneu cellar nance and humility 
having now a good home and very sufficient income he intended to mar 
and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn gloomily he had a wife in view as he meant to chua one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report 
this was his plan of amends 
of torment 
for inhabiting their fathers estate 
and he thought it an excellent one full of reliability and mitahlencss and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part 
his lean did not vary on seeing them 
miss bonnets lovely dice confirmed his views and cmlblishcd all his strict notions of what was due to superiority 
and for the first evening as was his settled choice 
the next morning however made an alteration 
for in a quarter of an hour tétc-h-téte with mrs bent before remark 
fast a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longboum produced from her amid very complaint switch and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on 
d as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say 
she could not positively answer 
— but she did not new of any prepossessing 
— 
her elder 
daughter she must just mention 
she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely be very soon engaged mr colling had only to change from jane to elizabeth 
and it was soon done 
done while mrs kenneth was stirring the fire 
elizabeth equally next to jam in birth and beauty succeeded her of course 
pride and prejudicial 7s l dis came to inquire and he bowed as they passed 
a were struck with the strangers air all wondered who he could be 
and dirty and ladies determined if possible to and out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot 
mr deny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend sir wicker who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their crops 
this was exactly as it should be 
for the young man wanted only regiments to make him completely charming 
his appearance was greatly in his favour 
he had all the best part of beauty 3 ne countenance a good figure and very pleasing address 
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation 
a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming 
and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeable when the sound of horses drew their notice and dry and hindley were seen riding down the street 
on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities 
hindley was the principal spoken and miss bonnet the principal object 
he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her 
mr darch corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to ax his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting 
both changed colour one looked white the other red 
mr wick after a few moments touched his hat 
i. f 7s pride and prejudice 
n salutation which mr darch us deigned to return 
what could be the meaning oil it i 
it was impossible to imagine 
it was him scribble not to long to know 
in another minute or hindley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend 
mr penny and mr wicker walked with the young ladies to the door of mr philips’s house and then made their bows in spite of miss india s pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs philips’s throwing up the parlour window and loudly recording the invitation 
is hills was always glad to see her nice 
and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own marriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr jones s schoolboy in the street who had told her that they were not to send an more draughts to tethered because the miss nets were come awn when her civility was claimed towards mr coal in by james introduction of him 
she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologize for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help battering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice 
mrs path is was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding 
but her contempt ration of one stranger was soon put an end to by exact mansions and inquiries about the other 
of whom however she could only tell her nice what they already knew that mr decay had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenant commission in the 
— hire 
she had been watchpride and prejudiced in him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr wicker appeared kith and ladies would certainly have continued the occupation but onluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the manger were become a stupid disagreeable fellow some of them were to dine with the eclipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wicket and give him an invitation also if the family from longboum would come in the evening 
this was agreed to and mrs pips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards 
the prospect of such delights was very cheering 
and the parted in mutual good spirits 
mr colling repeated his colonies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearied civility that they were perfectly needless 
as they w red home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen 
but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more ax lain such behaviour than her sister 
r calling on his return highly gratified mrs bonnet by admiring mrs philips’s manners and politeness 
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman 
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before 
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life 
a 7s pride and premises 
cheat 17 
s no objection was made to the young people a engagement 
with their aunt and all mr colling scruples of leaving mr and my bonnet for in single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his eve cousins at a table hour to mention 
and the had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the dawn room that mr william had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the house 
when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr colling was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at roarings 
a cow poison that did not at first convey much gratification 
ut when mrs pips understood from him what roarings was and who was its proprietor 
when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine's drawing-room and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds 
she felt all the force of the camp intent and would hardly have repeated a comparison with the housekeeper room 
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressionin praise of his own humble abode and the aim movements it was receiving 
he was happily employ until the gentlemen joined them 
and he found in mrs pips 3 very attentive listener whose opinion of hi consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to detail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could 
to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wind moss and prejudice 
17 for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece the interval of waiting appeared ve iron 
it was over at at however 
g he ntleriiyen did approach and when mr wicker w key into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration 
the officers of the 
— 
— hire were in general a very creditable gentlemanly set and the best of them were of the present party 
but mr william was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as thy were superior to the brown-faced stuffy uncle pips breathing port wine who followed them into the room 
mr william was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself 
and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest fullest most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker 
with such rival for the notice of the fair as mr wicket and the officers mr colling seemed to sink into insignificance 
to the young ladies he certainly was nothing 
but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs pills and was by her wakefulness most abundant supplied with coffee and muff 
when the card-tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist 
i know little of the are at present a said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation in life 
a mrs chips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason 
mr wicker did not play at whist and with ready 7s pride and prejudice 
delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and ladies 
at first there seemed danger of lying n't engrossing him entire 
for she was i most determined talker 
but being a clue extremely fond of lottery ticket 
she won grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bet and exclaiming after prize to have attention for any one in particular 
allowing for the common demands of the e mr wicker wan therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and the was very willing to hear him though what the chief zillah to hear the could not hope to he told the history of hi acquaintance with mr darch 
she dared not even mention that gentleman 
her curiosity however 
was unexpected relieved 
mr wicker began the subject himself 
he inquired how far tethered was from mention 
and after receiving her answer liked in a haunting manner how long mr dairy had been staying there 
about a month 2 aid elizabeth 
and then unwilling to let the object drop added a he is a man of v very large property in derby-hire i undcritjnd.” a year a lie wickhamg 
this estate there in a noble one 
clear ten thousand per annum 
you could not have met with a person more capable giving a certain information on that head than myself 
for have been connected with hi family in a particular manner from my infancy 10 elizabeth could not ut look surprised 
b you may well be surprised mill bonnet at ouch an action after seeing 
as you probably might 
the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday 
are you much acquainted with mr fancy i d a as much at i ever with to he d cried elizabeth warmly 
— a i have spent four day 
in the same home with him and i think him very disagreeable d i have no right to give my opinion d said sickness and babies 
7th ham as to his being agreeable or otherwise 
i am not qualified to form one 
i have known him too long and too well so be a fair judge 
it is impossible for m to be imperial 
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish 
and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else 
here you are in your own family 2 upon my word i say no more bar than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except tethered 
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire 
everybody is dining with his pride 
you will not and him more favourably key of by an one 
d i can not pretend to be sorry d said wick after a short interruption 
that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts 
but with linton i believe it does not often happen 
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he curses to be seen a i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an ill-tempered man wicker only shook his had 
d i wonder d said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer a i do not at all know 
but i beard nothing of his going away when i was at netherlield 
i hope your plans in favour of the 
shere will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood 
oh 
no 
it is not for m to be driven away by mr darch 
if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go 
we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding bias but what i might proclaim before all the world 
a sense of very great ill-usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is 
his father miss bonnet the 82 pride and prejudicial 
late mr dairy was one of the best man that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had 
and i can never be in company with this mr dry without being a grieved to the so by a thousand tender recollections 
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous 
but i verily believe 10 could forgive him anything and everything rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father elizabeth found the interest of the snub t income and listened with all her heart 
but the efficacy of it prevented farther inquiry 
mr wicker begun to speak on more general topics me up the neighbourhood the society appearing high y pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligent e gallantry 
it was the respect of constant society und good society 2 he ud ed 2 which was my chief incitement to enter the 
— hire 
i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable crops and my friend deny tempted me further by his account of their present manners and the ve great attentions and excellent acquaintance mention hail procured them 
society i own is necessary to me 
i have been a dismal pointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude 
i must have employment and society 
a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible 
the church taught to have been my profession 
i was brought up for the church and i thou d at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now a indeed 
b c yes 
the late mr darch bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift 
he was my grandfather and excessively attached to me 
i can not do justice to his kindness 
he meant to provide for pride and prejudice 
3 me am by and thought he had done it 
but when the living it was given elsewhere 
a good heavens 
a cried elizabeth 
a but how could but be i 
how could his will be disregarded 
— why did not you seek legal redress 
a 
there was just such an infinity in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law 
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darch chose to doubt it 
or to treat it as a merely condition commendations and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence 
in short anything or nothing 
certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man 
and no less certain is it that i not accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it 
i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely 
i can recall nothing worse 
but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me 
a this is quite shockingly 
he deserves to be publicly disgraced 2 some time or other he will be 
but it shall not be by m. till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose line elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them 
a but what d said she after a pause a can have been his motive 
— what can have induced him to behave so cruelly 
d a a thorough determined dislike of me 
a dislike which i can not but attribute in some measure to jealousy 
had the late mr dearly liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his father's uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in i annum k behinawuhhm fdhiuﬂind

and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make live shilling s any object 
there are undoubtedly many who co d not say the name but thank to lady catherine de brought i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters 
mr wickham’s attention was caught 
and after observing mr calling for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bough 
lady catherine de bough she replied has very lately given him a living 
i hardly know how mr colling was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long you know of course that lady catherine de bough and lady annie dairy were sisters 
consequent that she is aunt to the recent mr darch 2 o indeed i did on 
l knew nothing at all of lady catherine s connection 
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday 
a her daughter miss de bough will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates 
this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor mind hindley 
vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already selfdestined to another 
our calling said she speak highly both or lady catherine and her daughter 
but from some particular that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude rnioleads him and that in spite of her being his parents the is an arrogance conceited woman d i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wicker 
d i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that 8d pride and price

elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and the continued talking together with mutual satisfaction rapped put an end to cards and gave the rent of the ladies their share of mr wickham’l attentions 
there could be no convention in the noise of mrs philips’a supper party but hit manner recommended him to everybody 
whatever he aid was laid well 
and whatever he did done gracefully 
elizabeth went away with her head full of him 
she could think of nothing but of mr wicket and of what he had told her all the way home 
but there war not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither india nor mr colling were once silent

elizabeth related to jane the next day what had awed between mr wicket and herself 
jane fastened with astonishment and concern 
— 
she knew not how to believe that mr darch could be pride and prejudice 87 so unworthy of mr hindley s regard 
and yet it was not in her nature to question the capacity of a young man of such amiable appearance as withdraw 
the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings 
and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well o them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained 
they have both a said she d been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea 
interested pale have perhaps i resented each to the other 
t is in short impossible r us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have attenuated them without actual blame on either side a very true indeed 
— 
and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business 2 
do dear i as too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody laugh as much as you church but you will not laugh me out of my opinion 
m dearest izz do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr dared to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner 
one whom his father had promised to provide for 
it is impossible 
no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable it 
can his most intimate friends he so excessively deceived in him i 
oh no i can much more easily believe mr hindley's being imposed on than that mr wicker should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night 
names facts everything mentioned without ceremony 
if it be not so let mr darch contradict it 
besides there was truth in his looks 88 prone rum mice 
a it in difficulty indeed 
it in wag 
one does not know what to think 
i a room 
one known exact what to zillah your p 10 but jane could think with certainty on only one point 
that mr hindley if he bad keen on would have much to supper when the affair became public 
the two young ladies were immured from the robbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr hindley and hiiieten came to give their personal invitation for the long hall at tethered which was fixed for the fool owing tuesday 
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again 
called it an age since they had met and relmtcrlly asked what she haul been doing with herself since their separation 
to the rest of the family they paid little attention 
avoiding my bonnet 2 much an possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others 
they were noon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by an size and hurrying off an if eager to escape from my enter civilities 
the prospect of the netherlield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family 
my bonnet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr hindley himself indeed of a ceremonies card 
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attention of their brother 
and elizabeth thou hit with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr charm and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr darch look and behaviour

if there had not been a tethered ball to prepare for and talk of the younger mite bonnet would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to mary once 
no aunt no officer

chapter xiii 
ill elizabeth entered the drawn from at tethered and looked in vain for r wicker among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being resent had never occurred to her 
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked b any of those recollections that might not unreasoua y have alarmed her 
she had dressed with more than usual care and repassed in the highest s write for the conquest of all that remained unvalued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening 
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr days pleasure in the ingleyu’ invitation to the officers 
and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr deny to whom india eagerly applied and who told them that william had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned 
adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away us now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gens man here this part of his intelligence though unheard by dial was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that dared was not less miserable for wickham’l absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sh ned by immediate disappointment that she could ha y reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approach to make 
attention forbearance patience with dry was injury to wicked 
she was resolved against 9 
mr and 
icicle any nor of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which aim could not wholly summut even in speaking to mr hindley where blind partiality provoked her 
but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour 
and though every prospect of her own was decoyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits 
and having told all her grief 
to marlott lungs whom dnhadnmnenforawuhthewuwonablewmake a voluntary transition to the addition of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice 
the two am dance however brought a return of distress 
they were dances of mortification 
mr colling awkward and solemn apologiaing instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the charm and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dance can give 
the moment of her release from him was early 
she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking ofwickham and of hearing that beware universally liked 
when those dances were over the returned to marlott lucerne and war in conversation with her when she found here suddenly addressed by mr darch who took her so much by surprise in hit application for her hand that without knowing what she did the accepted him 
he walked away again immediately and the was left to fret over her own want of pretence of mind 
marlott tried to console her 
d i dare say you will and him very agreeable 
a heaven forbid 
— that 
would be the greatest misfortune of all l 
to and a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate 
— do not wish me such an evil 
when the dancing recommenced however and dry approached to claim her hand chariot could not help caution her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wicket to make her appear pride and prejudicial 
of pleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence 
elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she we arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr dairy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in holding it 
they stood for some time without asking a word 
and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resound not to break it 
till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance 
he replied and was again silent 
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with 
a it is your turn to say something now mr darch 
i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said 
a v well 
that reply will do for the present 
perhaps and by i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones 
but now we may be silent a do you talk by rule then while you are dancing 
b c sometimes 
one must k a little you know 
it would look odd to be entire y silent for half an hour together 
and yet for the advantage of ram conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible 2 are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine 2 
a both replied elizabeth archly 
a for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds 
we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that 9 pride and prejudice 
will amaze the whole room and be handed down to party with all the eclat of a proverbs 2 this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am mire d said he 
a how near it may be to mine i can not pretend to my 
ton think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly 
i must not decide on my own performances he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if the and her sisters did not very often walk to mary 
she answered in the affirmative 
and unable to resist the temptation added a when you met us there the other day we had been forming a new acquaintance the effect was immediate 
a deeper shade of humour overspread his features but he aid not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on 
at length darch spoke and in a command manner said 
mr william is blessed with such happy manners at my encourage his ruling friends 
whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain 
a he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with em basis 
and in a manner 
which he it likely to suffer from all his life 
fancy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject 
at that moment sir william lucy appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room 
but on perceiving mr dairy he stopped with a how of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner 
i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir 
such very superior dancing is not often seen 
it is evident that you belong to the first circles 
allow me to say however that your fair partner does not dis 
grace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure pride and prejudice 
as often repeated l when a coming desirable event my dear miss liza glancing at her sister and hindley shall take place 
what congratulation will then how in 
i appeal to mr darch 
but let me not interrupt you sin 
you will not thank me for obtaining you from the bewitching convent of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding melt the latter rest of this address was scarcely heard by darch 
but williams allusion to his friend seemed to wake him forcibly and hi 
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards hindley and jane who were dancing together 
recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said a sir williams interruption has made me forget what we 
were talking of 
i do not think we were speaking at all 
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves 
we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i can not imagine a what think you of books 2 d said he smiling 
looks 
oh 
no 
i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feeling a 10 am sorry you think so 
but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject 
we may compare different opinions no 
i cannut talk of books in a ball-room 
my head is always full of something else they pray 
always occupies ou in such scenes 
does it 
a mid he with a look of man eyes always a she replied without knowing what the said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her sudden exclaiming i remember hearing you once say i fancy that you hardly ever forgave that your presented me and babies 
men once cited was unappeasable 
you are very cautious i suppose as to its being tread 
d i am a said he with a warm voice 
e and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice 
a d i hope not 
a it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at link 
may i ask to what these questions tend 
b c merely to the illustrate of your character d said she endeavouring to shake of her gravity 
i am trying to make it out 
and what is your success 
d she shook her head i do not get on at all 
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly d i can readily believe 2 answered he gravely 2 that its ma ve great with respect to me 
and i killed wishymisr kennel that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would respect no credit on either but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours 2 he coldly replied 
she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence 
on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in days breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another 
they had not long separated when miss hindley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her 
a so miss liza i hear you are quite delighted with george wicker 
your pride and prejudice 
9th sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions 
and i and that the young man forgot to the you man his other communications that he was the son of old inch the late mr days afterward 
let me recommend you however as a friend not to ve implicit confidence to all his assertions 
for as to r darch using him ill it is perfectly false 
for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though rage wicked has treated mr diary in a most infamous manner 
i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr fancy is not in the least to blame that he can not hear to hear george wicker mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way 
his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it 
i pity you miss size for this discovery of your favourites guilt 
but real considering his descent one old not ax t much uttered his guilt an his descent appear by your account tube the same said elizabeth angrily 
for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darch reward and of bar i can assure you he informed me himself a i beg your pardon replied miss hindley turning away with a sneer 
a excuse my interference it was kindly means a silent girl 
said elizabeth to herself 
you are much mistaken if you expect to induce me by such a paltry attack as this 
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr arc 
she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of hindley 
jane met her with a smile of such sweet 9 run and miles 
complacency 
a glow of inch happy up uﬁicientlymarkedhovvell ﬁewundﬁdwith the occurrence of the evening 
elizabeth read herﬁdinggandatthat met nnlicimde for chasm resentment against his enemies and everything daggavevayhefme the hope annual laying in the aim way for happiness d i want to know laid she with a countenance no nailing than her titter that you have lam about mr wicker 
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person 
in which can you may be lure of my pardon into a replied jane i have not forgotten him 
but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you 
mr tingly doe not know the whole of hi finery and in quite ignorant of the circumstance which have principally offended mr darch 
but he will vouching for the good conduct the property and honour of his friend and in perfect convinced that mr wicked has deserved much era attention from mr darch than he has received 
and i am any to ray that by hi accountawell at his rider s mr sicken in by means a respectable young man 
i am afraid he in been very impatient and has deserved to lose mr dairy s regard mrs hindley does not know mr wicker himself 
d no 
he never saw him all the other morning at meryton.” this account then is what he has received from mr darch 
i an perfectly sallied 
but what does he say of the living 
d she does not exactly recollect the circular thoughhehaahmdthem from mr paramore than once but he believes that it was left to him only 
no sun romance 
9th d i have not a doubt of mr hindley's sincerity 2 laid elizabeth warmly 
but 
you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only 
mr hindley's defence of his friend win a very able one i dare say 
but since he is unacquainted with several pot of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before 
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment 
elizabeth listened with delight to the ha though modest hopes which jane entertained of biggiey’s regard and sand all in her power to frighten her confidence in it 
on their being joined by mr tingly himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucy 
to whose inquiry after the unpleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr colling came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery 
i have found out said he d by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patron 
i happened to over the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bough and of her mother lady catherine 
how wonderfully these sort of things occur 
who would have thought of or meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine e bought in this assembly 
i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before 
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology b you are not going to introduce yourself to mr dare 
“l’hdeed i am 
i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier 
i believe him to be lady too pride and prejudicial 
catherine it will be in in wer to accuse him that her ladyship was quite well 
yesterday sunlight 
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr fancy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt 
that it was not in the least never there should be any notice on either side 
and that izz were it must belong to mr fancy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance 
mr colling listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus 
a my dear minx elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding 
but permit me to an that there must be a wide distance between the stab shed forms of ceremony amongst the dainty and those which regulate the clergy 
for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom 
provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the mine time maintained 
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictate of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty 
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more petted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself and with a low how he left her to attack mr darch whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was ve evident 
her cousin prepared his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt an if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words pride and prejudice 
i 
apology 2 “hunsford c and a lady catherine de bought it vexed her to see him ax himself to such a man 
mr dairy was even in with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr colling allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility 
mr colling however was not discouraged from king again and mr darch contempt seemed ahunil’aeritly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight how and moved another way 
mr colling then returned to elizabeth 
i have no reason i assure us a said he broke dissatisfied with my reception 
r darch seemed much pleased with the attention 
he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the cow linen of saying that he was so well convinced of la y catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthy 
it was really a very handsome thought 
upon the whole i am much pleased with him as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bringing 
and the train of agreeable reflection which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane 
she saw her in ideas settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow 
and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like hindley's two sisters 
her mother thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much 
when they sat down to appear therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other 
and deeply was she vexed to and that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucy freely openly and of nothing 1802 pride and prejudice 
clue but of her expectation that jane would he soon married to mr hindley 
— it wan an animating object and my bonnet seemed incapable of fate hue while enervating the advantages of the match 
in being each a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the list points of aelfgratulation 
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection at much as she could do 
it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughter as jones marrying so greedy must throw them in the way of other rich men 
and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consider her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked 
it was necessary to make this circumstance in matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the coquette 
but no one was lest likely than mr bonnet to and comfort in staying at home at any period of her life 
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucy might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it 
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother a words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper 
for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darch who sat opposite to them 
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical 
a what is mr dared to me pray that i should be afraid of him 
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing be may not like to hear a for heaven s sake madam speak joan 
what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darch 10 
— you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing 
pride and prejudice 
1801 nothing that she could say however had any influence 
her mother would k of her views in the same intelligible bone 
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation 
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr dare though every glance convinced her of what she drew ed 
for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably vexed by her 
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity 
at length however mrs bonnet ha no more to lay 
and lady lucy who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken 
elizabeth now began to revive 
but not long was the interval of tranquillity 
for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the come my 
by many significant looks and silent entreaties dishes endeavour to prevent such a proof of como lausanne 
— but in vain 
mary would not understand em 
such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song 
elizabeth eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensation and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close 
for ma on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another 
mary powers were by no means fitted for such a dim lay 
her voice was weak and her manner affected 
elizabeth was in agonies 
she looked at jane to see how she bore it 
but jane was very composedly talking to hindley 
she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at dairy who continued how am arm mercy 
ever impenetrably sure 
she looked at her father to entrust his interference lest mary should be in nag all night 
he look the hint and when mary had wished her second song said aloud 
that will do exile well child 
you have delighted us long enough 
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit 
mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted 
and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her father's speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good 
others of the party were now applied to 
if i d said mr colling a were so fortunate as to be able to ring i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air 
for i music as a very innocent desertion and perfectly comparable with the profession of a clergyman 
i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to 
the rector of a parish has much to do 
— 
in the first place he must make such an agreement for them as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron 
he must write his own sermons 
and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible 
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliating manners towards everybody especially towards those to whom he owes his preference 
l can not acquit him of that duty 
nor could i d think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testify in his respect towards any bad connected with the mid ye and with a bow to r darch be concluded his speech which had been keen so loud as to be heard by half the room 
— any stared 
man smiled 
but no one looked more aroused than r bent himself while his wife seriously commended mr pride and prejudice 10s calling for having open so sensibly and observed in a half-whisper to la luck that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man 
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or linger success 
and happy did she think it for hindley and her sister that some the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed 
that his two sisters and mr darch however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her real lions was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentlemen or the insolent miles of the ladies were more intolerable 
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement 
she was teased by mr colling who continued most persevering by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of er power to dance with others 
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room 
he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it 
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening 
there was no arguing upon such a reject 
she owed her greatest relief to her friend hiss lucy who often joined them and good-naturedly engaged mr éollins’s conversation to herself 
she was at least free from the licence of mr darch fisher notice 
though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak 
she felt it to be the probable l h 10s pride and prejudice

my hum and her finger immeyopened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient m have the house to themselves 
they repulsed every attempt of my bonnet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party 
which we very lively relieved by the long patches of mr colling who was complimentary mr wrongly and his listen on the elegance of their entertainment 
and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their gusts 
dance said nothing at all 
mr bonnet in equal silence was enjoying the scene 
mr willingly and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other 
elizabeth preserved at my a silence as either men hum or mile hindley 
and even dial was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of a lord how tired i am 
a accompanied by a violent yawn 
when at length they are to take leave my bonnet wan most refusing civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed himself particularly to mr bringing to admire him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation 
hindley was all grateful pleasure and be readily engaged for taking the earliest oop rotundity of waiting on her after his return from lion on whither he wan obliged to go the next day for a short time 
mrs bonnet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the c. w pride and prejudice 
10th house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlement new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherlield in the course of three or four months 
of having another daughter married to mr colling she thought with half certainty and with considerable though not a pleasure 
elizabeth was the least dear to her of her children 
and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by mr hindley and tethered 
chasm iii 
he next day opened a new scene at longboum.. mr colling made his declaration in four 
having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of evidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very order manner with all the observances which be supposed a regular pan of the business 
on ending mrs bonnet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words a may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i explicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning 
a before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise mrs banquet instantly answered 
oh dear 
— yes 
certainly 
i am sure dizzy will be very happy 
i am sure she can have no objection 
come city i want you up-stairs and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out 10s ram me prick 
a dear madam do not go 
i beg will not go 
mr colling must excuse me 
he can me nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear 
i am going away myself a no no nonsense dizzy 
i desire you will any where you are and upon elizabeth seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added a lazy i insist upon your saying and hearing mr colling 
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction 
and a moment consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over us soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion 
mrs bonnet and fifty walked oil and as soon as they were gone mr colling began 
believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any service rather adds to your other reflections 
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness 
but allow me to assure you that i have our respected mother s permission for this address 
ou can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse 
however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissoluble 
my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken 
almost as soon as i entered the house i mingled you out as the companion of my future life 
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying 
and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did i 
the idea of mr coins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the pride and prejudice 
1000 short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued 
my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circummmoes like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish 
secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness 
and thirdly 
which perhaps i ought to have mentioned relied that it is the particular advice and commendations of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling process 
twice has she descended to give me her opinion gnashed too i on this subject 
and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsfordabetween our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkins was arranging miss de gough footstool that she said our calling you must marry 
a clergyman like you must marry 
— chase properly chose a gentleman for my sake 
and for your 1801 
let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way 
this is my advice 
find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hereford and i will visit her allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de boughs as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer 
you will and her manners beyond nothing can describe 
and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite 
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony 
it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbonrn instead of my own height boyhood where i assure you there are many amiable sung women 
but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i ii pride and prejudicial 
could not myself without resolving to chua 3 wife from among his daughter 
that the lost to them might be as little at possible when the melancholy event takes place 
which however an i have already mid mayn't e for several em 
thiahaabeeumy motive my fair cousin and fatter myself it will not link me in your esteem 
and now naming remain for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection 
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with 
and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cent which will not be your till after your mother s decease it all that you may ever be entitled to 
on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent 
and you my name yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are many a it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now 
b you are too hasty air a she cried 
b you forget that i have made no answer 
let me do it without further loss of time 
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me 
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposal but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them 
i am not now to learn a replied mr coins with a formal wave of the hand 2 that it is usual with young ladies to reject the address of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he burst a lies for their favour 
and that sometimes the refusal repeated a second or even a third time 
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long 
a upon my word air cried elizabeth a your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration 
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies pride and prejudice 
iii much young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their ha inquests on the chance of being asked a second time 
i 
am perfectly serious in my retina 
you could not make 
i 
happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so 
nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would and me in every respect ill qualify for the situau'on.” were it certain that lady catherine would think so aid mr colling very gravely 
but i can not imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you 
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualiﬁcations.” 2 indeed mr goblins all praise of me will be unnecessary 
you must give me leave to for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say 
i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise 
in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and ma take possession of longboum smote whenever it far as without any self-reproach 
this matter may be considered therefore as really settled 
and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr colling thus addressed her a when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me 
though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it m be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character l l 2 ii

top in 
r colling was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love 
for mrs bonnet having dandled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast-room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection 
mr colling received and returned these limitations with equal measure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character 
this information however startled mrs bonnet 
— she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him b protesting against his proposal but she dared not be ever it and could not help saying so 
i in pride and prejudice 
but depend upon it mr calling the added 
that izz shall be brought to reason 
i will speak to her about it myself directly 
she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest 
but i will male her know it 
a pardon me for interrupting you madam 2 cried mr colling 
but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for ha lineal 
in the marriage state 
if therefore the actually persist in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity 
air on quite understand me said mrs silence a armed 
a izz is only headstrong in such matters as these 
in everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived 
i will go directly so mr bonnet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library 10th 
mr bonnet you are wanted immediately 
we are all in an a roar 
you must come and make dizzy marry mr hollis for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have lurch mr linnets raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a uffa unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication 
i have not the pleasure of understanding ou d said he when she had finished her speech 
10 what an you talking 10 of mr rolling and dizzy 
izzy dearest she will not have mr cousins and mr colling begins to say that he will not have dizzy pride and prejudice 
he d and what am i to do on the occasion 
— it seems an ho less business a peak to lazily about it yourself 
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him a let her be called down 
she shall hear my opinion mrs bonnet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library 
d come here child a cried her father as she appeared 
i have sent for you on an affair of importance 
i understand that mr colling has made you an offer of marriage 
is it true 
a elizabeth replied that it was 
very well 
and this offer of marriage you have raised 
a d i have sir 
very well 
we now come to the ink 
your mother insists upon your accepting it 
is it not so mrs bonnet p b c yes or i will never see her against an unhappy alternate is before you elizabeth 
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your invents 
your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr cousins and i will never see you again if you 10 
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of ouch a beginning 
but mrs bonnet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed 
a what do you mean mr bonnet by talking in this way 
you promised me to inn 
upon her marrying me 
my dear replied her husband a l have two small favours to request 
f first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion 
and secondly of my room 
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be 16a pride and prejudice not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs bonnet give up the point 
she talked to elizabeth again and again 
coaxed and threatened her by turns 
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest 
but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering 
and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks 
though her manner cried however her determination never did 
mr colling meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed 
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him 
and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way 
his regard for her was quite imaginary 
and the possibility of her deserving her mother reproach prevented his feeling any regret 
while the family were in this confusion chariot lucy came to and the day with them 
she was met in the vestibule 
e ladies who trying to her cried in a half whisper a am glad you are come for there is such fun here 
— 
what do you think has hasp ned this morning i 
mr colling has made an offer to izzy and she will not have him marlott had hardly time to answer before they were joined by ditty who came to tell the urn news 
and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room where mrs blunt was alone than the likewise noan on the subject calling on miss luck for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend izz to comply with the wishes of all her family 
a play do my dear miss lucy b c she added in a melancholy tone 2 for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves 
marlott s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth 
a aye there she comes continued mrs tanner pride and prejudice 
x 17 looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way 
— but i tell you what miss dizzy 
if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all 
and i am sure 10 do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead 
— i shall not be able to keep you 
and so i warn you have done with you from this very day 
— i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will and me as good as my word 
i have no pleasure in talking to dutiful clrildrcu 
— not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to anybody 
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking 
nobody can tell what i suffer 
— but it 
is always no 
those who do not complain are never pitied her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation 
she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr colling who entered with an air nor stately than usual and on perceiving whom the said to the girls now i do insist uz n it that you all of you hold your tongues and let r cousins and me have a little conversation together 
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and fifty followed but india stood her ground determined to hear all she could 
and chariot detained wrest the civility of mr colling whose inquiries after herself f and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity misled herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear 
in a doleful voice mrs bonnet thus began the projected conversation

my object has been to lean an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family 
andifmymmcrhas been at all reprehensith here beg leave to apologise chant ii 
he discussion of mr colling offer was not nearly at an end and earth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feeling necessarily attending it and occasionally from name peevish allusion of her mother 
a for the gentleman himself wi feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarruemen or dejection or y trying to avoid her but by pride and prejudice 
he stillness of manner and respectful silence 
he scarcely ever spoke to her and the arduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss local whose civility in listening to him was a reasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend 
the marrow produced no statement of mrs bonnets ill humour or i health 
mr colling was also in the same state of angry pride 
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it 
he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay 
after breakfast the girls walked to mention to inquire if mr wicker were returned and to lament over his absence from the tethered ball 
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody was well talked oven 
to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence bad been self-imposed 
i found said he d as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darch 
— 
that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself 
she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wicket and another officer walked back with them to longboum and during the walk he particularly attended to her 
his accompanying them was a double advantage 
she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother 
soon after their return a letter was delivered to 27 pride and prejudicial miss bonnet 
it came from tethered and was opened immediately 
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little oppressed palm well covered with a lady s fair bowing hand 
and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages 
jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation 
but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wicked 
and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her upstairs 
when they had gained their own room jane taking out her letter said a this is from caroline hindley 
what it contains has surprised me a good deal 
the whole party have left petersfield by this time and are on their way to town 
and without any intention of coming back again 
you shall hear what she says 
she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where mr hours had a house 
the next was in these words 
i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend 
but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence 
i depend on you for that to these nightgown ax relations elizabeth listened with all the insensibility o distrust 
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from petersfield would prevent mr hindley's pride and prejudice 
in being there 
and as to the loss of their walked she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to beg it in the enjoyment of his 
a it is unlucky d said she after a short pause 2 that you should not he able to see your friends before they gave the country 
but may we not hope that the good of future happiness to which miss hindley looks word may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters 
mr hindley will not be detained in london by them caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter 
i will read it to on 
y when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days 
but as we are certain it can not be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have denied on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in i comfortless hotel 
many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter 
i wish l could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the crowd 
but of that i desire 
i sincerely hope your christmas in herefordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beauty will he so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall d give you d a it is evident by this added jane 2 that he comes back no more this winter it is only evident that miss hindley does not mean he should why will you think so 
it must be his own doing 
he is his own master 
but you do not know i. i i 2 10 pride and prejudice 
m. i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me 
i will have no reserve whom you 
mr fancy is impatient to see his sister 
and to confirm the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again 
i really do not think georgian darch has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments 
and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting 
from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister 
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject 
but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable 
my brother admirers her greatly already 
he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing 
her relations all wish the connection as much as his own 
and at sister's partiality is not mislaying me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman heart 
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many 2 a what think ou of 85 sentence my dear dizzy 
d if jane as she finished it 
2 is it not clear enough 
does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister 
that the is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference 
and that if she suspect the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly 
to put me on my guard 
can there be any other opinion on the subject 2 2 yes there can 
for mine is totally different 
— will you hear it 2 d a most willingly 
b you shall have it in a few words 
miss hindley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him pride and prejudice 
12th to marry miss darch 
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you 
jane shook her head 
indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection 
miss hindley i am sure can not 
she is not such a simpleton 
could she have seen half as much love in mr fancy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes 
but the case is this 
we are not rich enough or grand enough for them 
and she is the more anxious to get miss fancy for her brother from the notion that when there has been an intermarriage she may have less trouble in chewing a second 
in which there is certainly some ingenuity and x dare say it would succeed if miss de bough were out of the way 
but my dearest jane you can not seriously imagine that because miss hindley tells you her brother early admirers miss dairy he is in the smallest degree ends sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend if we thought alike of miss single a replied jane 
your representation of all this might make me 31 
easy 
but i know the foundation is unjust 
line is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one 
and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself that is right 
you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine 
believe her to be deceived by all means 
you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer about my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere 2 2 12s pride and prejudicial b you must decide for yourself a aid elizabeth 
and if upon mature deliberating you find that the misery of disobeying his two lines more than equivalent to the happiness being his wife i advise you b all means to refuse him a ow can you talk so 
said jane faintly smiling 
you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their approbation i could not hesitate i did not think you would and that being the case i can not consider your situations with much compassion 
a but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required 
a thousand things may arise in six months 
2 the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt 
appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolinas interested withal and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or fretfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one 
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing in happy effect 
james temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that hindley would return to netherlield and answer eve wish of her heart 
hey agreed that mrs kenneth should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct 
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and the bewailed it an exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting to intimate together 
after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that mr hindley would be soon down again and soon pride and prejudice 
if dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had beenjnvited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses 
chapter 3 he bonnets were engaged to dine with the cases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucy so kind as to listen to r colling 
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her 
a it keeps him in good humour d sir she d and i am more obliged to you than i can express chariot assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time 
this was very amiable but charlotte’s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of 
— its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of mr colling addresses by engaging them towards herself 
such was miss outcasts scheme 
and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night chua would have felt almost sure of success if he hurl not been to leave i-lcrtfordshirc so very soon 
but here she did injustice to the tire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucy lodge to throw himself at her feet 
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise 
for though feeling almost secure and with reason for marlott had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diligent since the adventure of 85

and it was bestowed with a most alacrity 
mr colling s resent circumstances made it a most eligible match or their daughter to whom they could give little fortune 
and his aspects of future wealth were exceedingly fair 
lady lucy began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had over excited pinafore how many years longer mr bonnet was likely to live 
and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr colling should he in possession of the longboum estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st james 
the whole familyf‘in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion 
he younger girl s erred hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done 
and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte’c dying an old maid 
marlott herself was tolerpride and prejudice 
12th aby composed 
she had gained her point and had time to consider of it 
her relations were in general satisfactory 
mr calling to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable 
his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary 
but still he would be her husband 
without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object 
it was the only honourable provision liar well-educated young women of small fortune and however certain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservation from want 
this reservation she had now obtained 
and at the age of twenty-seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it 
the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bonnet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person 
elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her 
and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such a approbation 
she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr colling when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before my of the family 
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept within difficulty 
or the curiosity excited by his long shame burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to eve and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial for he was longing to punish his prosperous love 
as he was to begin this journey too early on the marrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leavetaking was formed when the ladies moved for the night 
and mrs bonnet with great politeness and cordiality mid how happy they should he to see him at longboum again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them

xiv dear madam he replied this invitation is part rely gratifying became it in what i have been hoping to receive 
and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as ponihle.” were all vanished 
and mr bonnet who could no means wish for no opened a return immediately aid 
a but in there not danger of lady catherine dip approbation here my good air 
you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroneaa.” 2 my dear sir a replied mr colling i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking no material a step without her ladyship concurrence.” you can not be too much on your guard 
risk anything rather than her dioplczmire 
and if you and it likely to be mim by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly i home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence 
a believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention 
and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a mere of thanks for thin as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in herefordshire 
an for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not except my cousin elizabeth with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew 
all of them equally surprised to and that he meditated a quick return 
my bonnet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him 
she hated his ability much higher than any of the other 
there was a validity in his reflections pride and prejudicial 10 250 which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion 
but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away 
miss lucy called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before 
the possibility of mr colling fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two 
but that chariot could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was corn urgently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of corn and she could not help crying out engaged to mr colling 
my dear chariot 
am able 
he steady countenance which miss lucy had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach 
though as it was no more than she sex she soon regained her composure and calmly reap od 
why should you be surprised my dear liza 
— do you think it incredible that mr colling should be able to procure any woman good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you 2 2 but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness 
i see what you are feeling a replied chariot 
you must be surprised very much surprised 
so lately as mr colling was wishing to marry you 
but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will satisfied with what i have done 
i am not romantic 30 pride and prejudice 
you know 
i never was 
i ask only a comfortable home 
and considering mr colling character connection and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him in as fair as mr people can boat on entering the marriage started elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly 
a 
and after an awkward pause they returned to the m of the family 
marlott did not may much larger and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard 
it ma a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of to unsuitable a match 
the strangeness of mr colling making two officers of marriage within three days wan nothing in corn ribbon of hi 
being now accepted 
she had ways fee t that chariot s opinion of matrimony wan not exactly like her own but she could not have in it possible that when called into action the wo d have sacrificed every better feeling worldly advantage 
marlott the wife of mr colling wan a most humiliating picture 
— 
and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem wan added the dimming conviction that it was impossible for that 
friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen 
gibbous jill elizabeth wan sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what he had heard and doubting whether she was authorities to mention it when sir william lucy himself appeared sent by hi daughter to announce her engaged to the family 
with many compliment to them and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter 
to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous 
for mrs bonnet with more perseverance than politeness protested he pride and prejudice

must be entirely milker 
and ladies always unguarded and often uncivil boisterous exclaimed 
a good lord 
sir william how can you tell such a story 
do not you know that mr colling want to marry lily 
nothing lest than the compliance of a counter could have home without anger such treatment 
but sir williams good breeding carried him through it all 
and though he begged ve to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing money 
elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her riper knowledge of it from charing herself 
and en endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamation of her mother and sisters y the earnestness of her congratulation to sir william in which the was reading joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr cousins and the convenient distance of hereford from london 
mrs bonnet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained 
but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent 
in the first place she persisted in believing the whole of the matter 
secondly she was very sure that mr colling had been taken in 
thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy t other 
and sourly that the match might be broken o 
two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief 
and the other that she herself had been barbarous used b them all and on there two opine she principally we t during the rest of the day 
nothing could console and nothing appeared her 
or did that day wear out her 1/2 pride and prejudice 
resentment 
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month away before she could speak to sir william or y lucy without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter 
mr bonnet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort 
for it gratified him he mid to discover that chariot lucy whom he had been used to think tolerant sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter 
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match 
but she said less of her astonishment than of her nearest desire for their happiness 
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable 
kill an indian were far from envying miss luck for r colling was only a clergyman 
and it affected them in no other way than at a piece of news to spread at 
hareton 
lady lucy could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs bonnet the comfort of having a daughter well married 
and she called at longboum rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though mrs bonnet s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away 
between elizabeth and chariot there was a restraint which he t them mutually silent on the subject 
and elizabeth eft persuaded that no real come once could ever subsist between them again 
her disappointment in marlott made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose recite and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as hindley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return 
jane had sent caroline on early answer to her letter pride an d prejudice 
i 31 and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again 
the promised letter of thank from mr colling arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth s abode in the family might have prompted 
after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeds to inform them with many rapturously ax passions of his ha illness in having obtained the aﬂfcﬁon of their amiable fee neighbour bliss lugs and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had en so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he ho to be able to return on monday fortnight 
for any catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unalterable argument with his amiable chariot to name an early day for making him the happiest of men 
mr colling return into hertfordshire was no longer a misery of pleasure to mrs bonnet 
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband 
it was very strange that he should come to longboum instead of to lucy lodge 
it was also very inconveniences and exceedingly troublesome 
she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable 
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bonnet and they gave way on y to the greater distress of mr hindley s continued absence 
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject 
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly revelled in mention of his coming no more to the old the whole winter 
a report which highly incensed mrs bonnet and which she never failed to contradict is a most scandalous falsehood 
i 104 pills de an d prejudice even elizabeth began to fear 
not that hindley wan indifferent 
but that he listen would be mensful in keeping him away 
unwilling a the was to admit an idol so destructive of jaded happiness and to dimourlhle to the nobility of her lover the could not vent is frequently recurring 
the united effort of his two unfeeling finer and of hi overpowering friend trained by the attractions of mice dairy and the amusement of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment 
all for jane her anxiety under thin was of course more painful than eliubeth’l kite whatever in felt the was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject wan never alluded to 
but as no such delicacy remained her mother an hour seldom lasted in which she did not talk of hindley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back the should think herself very ill used 
it needed all james neatly milan to hear these attach with tolerable tranquillity 
mr colling returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn war not quite i gracious an it had been on hit link introduction 
he was too happy however to need much attention 
and luckily for the others the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company 
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucy lodge and he sometime returned to leghorn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed 
mrs bonnet wan really in a most pitiable state 
the very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour 
and wherever she went she was sum of hearing it talked of 
the sight of miss lucy was odious to her 
as her succour in pride and prejudice 150 that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence 
whenever charles came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of immersion 
and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr colling was convinced that they were talking of the longboum estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughter out of the house as soon as mr bonnet were dead 
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband 
a indeed mr bonnet d said she it is very hard to think that chariot lucy should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for in and live to see her take my place in it 
a 
y clear do not give way to such lory thoughts 
let us hope for better things 
cut us fatter ourselves that i may be the survivors this was not very consoling to mrs bonnet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before 
i can not bear to think that they should have all this estate 
if it was not for the small i should not mind it 
a what should not you mind 
i should not mind anything at all 
d let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility d i never can be thankful mr bonnet for anything about the tail how any one could have the conscience to tail away an estate from one s own a daughters i can not understand 
and all for the sake of mr colling tool 
why should be have it more than anybody else 
d i leave it to yourself to determine d said mr bonnet

chapter 1100 
1858 hindley s letter moved and put an end to doubt 
the ve first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all ended in london for the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to hit friend in herefordshire before he left the country 
hope wan over entirely over 
and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter the found little except the porch affection of the writer that could give her any comfort 
mim darch praise occupied the chief of it 
her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to products the account banishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter 
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of mr darch house and mentioned with rapture some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture 
elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation 
her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all others 
to caroline assertion of her brothers being partial to miss fancy the d no credit 
that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done 
and much no she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that laziness of temper that want of pro r relolutionhwhich now made him the slave of his signing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations 
had his own happiness however 
been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best 
pride and prejudice 
117 but her interest was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself 
it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must unavailing 
she could think of nothing else 
and yet whether hindley's regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference 
whether he had been aware of lanes attachment or whether it had escaped his observation 
whatever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained the same her peace equally wounded 
a day or two passed before jane had courage to k of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs nets leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about tethered and its master she could not help laying e s that my dear mother had more command over herself i she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflection on him 
but i will not repined 
it can not last long 
he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solitude but said nothing 
you doubt me a cried jane slightly colouring 
indeed you have no reason 
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all 
i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with 
thank god 
i have not bill pain 
a little time therefore 
i shall certainly try to get the better with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to an one but myself 
a y dear jane 
a exclaimed elizabeth you are too good 
your sweetness and disinterested are i. k 18 pride and prejudice 
really angelic 
i do not know what to say to ou 
i feel as if i had never done you justice or love you a you deserve 
mine bonnet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sister s warm affection 
a nay said elizabeth this is not fair 
tai wish to think all the world re table and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody 
i on y want to think you effect and you set yourself against it 
do not be a rail of my running into any excess of my approaching on our privilege of universal good-will 
you need not 
ere are few ole whom i really love and still fewer of whom think well 
the more i see of the world the more am i disaau'sﬁed with it 
and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense have met with two instances lately one i will not mention 
the other is charlotte’s marriage 
it is unaccountable 
in every view it is unaccountable 
a my dear izz do not give way to such feelings as these 
they will ruin your happiness 
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper 
consider mr colling respectability and chariot s prudent steady character 
remember that she is one of a large family 
that as to fortune it is a most eligible match 
and be ready to believe for everybody sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin 
c to oblige you i would try to believe almost anything but no one else could be generated by such a belief as this 
for were i persuaded that marlott had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart 
my pride and prejudice 
30 dear jane mr colling is a conceited pompous narrow-minded silly man 
you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him can not have a proper way of thinking 
you shall not defend her though it is charlie lucy 
you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade herself or me that selfishness is prudence insensibility of danger security for happiness i must think our language too strong in king of ho 2 replied anew 
e and i hope you willfconvinoed of it by seen them happy together 
but enough of this 
you a alluded to something else 
you mentioned two instances 
i can not understand you but i entreat you dear dizzy not to pain me by thinking that peru to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk 
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured 
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect 
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us 
women fancy admiration means more than it does 
and men take care that they should lift it is designed done they can not be justified 
but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine 
d i am far from distributing any part of mr bingiey’s conduct to design d said elizabeth 
but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there maybe misery 
thoughtlessness want of attention to other people feelings and want of resolution will do the business a and do you impulse it to either of those 19 d ye 
to the last 
but if i go on i shall displaced you by saying what i think of persons you esteem 
stop me whilst 
you can 
no m and prrjiidici 
you then in opposing his sisters influence him i 
a yes in conjunction with his friends i can not believe it 
why should they try to influence him 
th can only wish his happiness 
mdifheisanac www.motherwomancan secure it a your link portion is false 
they may wish many things besides his happiness 
they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence 
they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money got connection and pride a beyond a doubt they do wish him to chase minx fancy a replied jane 
but this na be from better feelingthan you are supposing 
hey have known her much longer than they have known me 
no wonder if they love her better 
but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother 
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable 
if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us 
if he were so they could not succeed 
by supposing such an affection you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy 
do not distress me by the idea 
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken 
or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters 
let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood 
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr hindley s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them 
mrs bonnet still continued to wonder and revenge at his returning no more and though a day seldom in which elizabeth did not account for it wearily pride and prejudice 
149 there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity 
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more 
but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day 
mrs bonnets best comfort was that mr hindley must be down again in the summer 
mr bonnet treated the matter differently 
so lazy d said he one day a your sister is crossed in love i and 
i congratulate her 
next to being married a girl likes to he crossed in love a little new and then 
it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her come onions 
when is your turn to come 
you'll ha lybeartobelong overdone by j em now is our time here are a curs enough at error to say it all the young ladies in the country 
let widlfhoam be your man 
he is a pleasant fellow and would jill you creditable d thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me 
we must not all expect jane s good fortune 
true d said mr bonnet 
but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it mr wickham’s society was of material service in d fling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences thrown on many of the leghorn family 
they w him often and to his other commendations was now added that of general unreserved 
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr dairy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed 
and izz pride and prior 
everybody was eased to think how much they had always disliked r darch before they had known anything of the matter 
kenneth was the only creature who could suppose there might be any attenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire 
her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowance and urged the possibility of mistakes 
but by everybody else mr dairy was condemned as the wont of men 
chapter i 
after a week spent in processions of love and schemes of fidelity mr colling was called from his amiable chariot by the arrival of saturday 
the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride 
as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day you d be lived that was to make him the happiest of men 
he took leave of his relations at langdon with as much solemnity as before 
wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks 
on the following monday mrs bonnet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn 
mr garden was a sensible gentlemanly man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as demon 
the tethered ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouse could have been so well-read and arabic 
mrs gardeners who was several years younger than mrs bonnet and mrs hills was an porch and prejudice 
149 amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn niece 
between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard 
they had frequently been staying with her in town 
the first part of mrs gardener s business on her arrival was to contribute her presents and describe the west fashion 
when this was done she had a less active part to play 
it became her turn to listen 
mrs bonnet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of 
they had all been very ill-used since she hat aw her sister 
two of her irish had been on the point of marriage and after a 
there was nothing in art 
i do not blame jane d she continued for jane would have got mr hindley if she could 
but izz 
oh sister 
it is very hard to think that she might have been mr colling s wife by this time had it not been for her own perverseness 
he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him 
the consequence of it is that lady lucy will have a daughter married before i have and that longboum estate is just as much entailed as ever 
the cases are very artful people indeed sister 
they are all for what they can get 
i am sorry to say it of them but so it is 
it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before an body else 
however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves 
mrs garden to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeth correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nice turned the conversation 
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke in pride and prejudice more on the subject 
a it seems likely to have been a delectable match for jane 2 mid she 
d i am worry it went off 
but the-achingsha soften 
a dun m such as you describe mr magley so easily all 
in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separated them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconnancies are very frequent 2 an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for in 
we do not under by accident 
it does not often happen that the interference of friend will persuade a young man of independent form to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before but that expression of violently in love it so black-eyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little item 
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour acquaintance an to a real strong attachment 
my how orbit 
we mr bingley’u love 
d i never now a more promising inclination 
he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her 
every time they met it was more decided and remarkable 
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not 
asking them to dance 
and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer 
could there be linger s pony 
is not general civility the very essence of love i 
a oh yes i 
of that kind of love which i supposed him no have felt 
poor june 
i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately 
it had better have happened to you izzy 
you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner 
but do you think she won d be prevailed on to go back with us 
change of scene might be of nice 
and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything pride and prejudice 
its elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sisters ready acquiescence 
d i hope added my garden 
that no consideration with regard to this young man will induce her 
we live in so different a rest of town all our connection are so different and you well know we a out so little that it is re improbable that they thou d meet at all unless he real y comes to see her a and 150 is quite in blue 
for he is now in the custody of his friend an mr fancy would no more called him to call on jane in such a of london 
my dear aunt how could a think of it 
mr diary may perhaps have beard of such a place as gracechurch study but he would hardly think a month s abandon enough to please him from its impurity were he once to enter it 
and depend upon it mr hindley never stirs without him so much the better 
i hope th will not meet at all 
but does not jane correspond with his sister 
so will not be able to help calling d she will drop the acquaintance entirely but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this it as well as the still more interesting one of binglty’s being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless 
it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be estimated and the influence of his friends successfully completed by the more natural influence of jane s attractions 
miss bonnet 
accepted her aunt invitation with pleasure 
and the hinges were no otlrenvise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped by carolinas not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him 
4d pride and much 
the gardener bayed week at longboum 
and what with the phillipses the lucerne and the others there was not a day without it engagement 
man bent head to care lily provided for the enterninntent of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner 
when the engagement was for home come of the office always made part of it 
of which faced mr wieltharn was sure to be one 
and on these occasion my garden rendered auspicious by elizabeth’warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both 
without supposing them from what she saw to be ve strictly in love their preference of each other was in enough to make her a little uneasy 
and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment 
to mr gardener william had one mean 
of according pleasure unconnected with his general powers 
about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage the had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbythire to which he belonged 
they had therefore many acquaintance in common 
and though wicker had been little there since the death of darkest father ever ears before it was yet in his power to go her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring 
my garden had seen temperly and known the late mr dry by character perfectly well 
here consequently war an inexhaustibesubject of discourse 
in comparing her recollection of temperly with the minute description which wigwam could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late sense the was delighting both him and half 
on being made acquainted with the present mr dare s treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentlepride and prentice 17 men repute disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was convent at last that she recollected having hard mr fitzwilliam darch formerly spoken of as a very proud ill-natured boy 
bit ai 
is gardeners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone 
after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on 
you are too sensible a girl izz to fall in love merely because you are warned against it 
and therefore i am not afraid of speaking o only 
seriously i would have you be on your gun do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudently 
i have nothing to say a against birches is a most interesting young man 
and i he had the famine he ought to have i should think ou could not do better 
but as it is you must not at your fancy run away with you 
you have openly and we all expect you to use it 
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure 
you must not drop pint your father 
a y dear aunt this is being serious indeed ye and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise a well then you need not be under any alarm 
i will take care of myself and of mr wicker too 
he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it a elizabeth you are not serious now 
d i beg your pardon i will try again 
at present i 4d pride and prejudicial 
am not in love with mr wicker 
no i certainly am not 
but be is beyond all comparison the most i able man i ever saw 
and he becomes really attached to me 
i believe it will better that he should not 
i see the imprudence of it 
oh 
bob 
abominable mr darch 
— my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it 
my father however is partial to mr wicker 
in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhasp y 
but since we see e day that where there is a action les a-doing withheld by immediate want mim entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow 
creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist 
all that i can i on therefore is not to be in a hurry 
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his rest when i am in comes y with him i will not be wishing 
in short i will’il‘b my best perhaps it will be as well if you discourse e his coming home so very often 
at least 
you sho d not mind your mother of inviting him 
as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from 117 
but do not imagine that he is always here so often 
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week 
you know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends 
but really an upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be the wisest 
and now i hope you are satisﬁed.” her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hunts they parted 
a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented 
pride and prejudice 
149 mr colling returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardeners and jane 
but as he took up in 
abode with the leaves his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bonnet 
his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length on far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to lay in an ill-natured tone that she a subdued th might be happy 
thursday was to be the wedding y and 
on wednesday miss lucy paid her farewell visit 
and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mother ungraciously and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room

a my father and marian are to come to me in march 2 added chariot c and i hope you will consent to be of the party 
indeed elias you will be as welcome to me as either of them the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set of

i found that miss dare was expected to dinner 
i wish i could see her 
nay visit was not long as caroline and mrs hours were going out 
i dare say i shall soon see them here elizabeth shook her head over this letter 
it come viewed her that accident only could discover to mr hindley her sisters being in town 
four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him 
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it 
but she could no longer be blind to miss hindley's inattention 
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inviting every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear 
but the shortness of her staff and yet more the alteration of her manner would all ow jane to deceive herself no longer 
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt 
a my dearest dizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumph in her better judgment at m expense when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss hindley's regard for me 
but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my conscience was as natural as your suspicion

i can not but wonder however at her having any such fears now became if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago 
he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself 
and yet it should seem by her owner of talking as if he wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to mine darch 
i can not understand it 
if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there it a strong appearance of simplicity in all this 
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy 
your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt 
let me hear from you very soon 
miss jingled said something of his never returning to tethered again of giving up the house but not with any certainty 
we had better not mention it 
i am extremely glad that you have such plant accounts from our friends at hereford 
pray go to see them with sir william and marian 
i am sure you will be very comfortable there 
— your cat this letter gave elizabeth some pain 
but her spirit returned as the considered that jane would no longer be pride and prejudicial 150 dumped by the sister at least 
all expectation float the brother was now absolutely over 
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions 
his character sunk on every review of it 
and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darch sister as by wickham’s account she would make him abundant regret what he had thrown away 
mrs gardener about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information 
and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself 
his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else 
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain 
her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was twisted with believing that ll would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it 
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable 
but elizabeth less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in marlott s did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence 
nothing on the contrary could he more natural 
and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was read to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both an could we sincerely wish him happy 
all this was knowledge to mrs gardener 
and after relating the circumstances she thus went on 
d i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love 
for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil 
but my feelings are not only cordial towards kin they are even imperial town s miss king 
i can not and out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least uncle l 4 pride and prejudice 
willing to think her a very good sort of girl 
there can be no love in all this 
my wakefulness has been effectual 
and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i dis 
merely in love with him i can not say that i regret my comparative insignificance 
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly 
dirty and ladies take his affection much more to heart than i do 
there young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain 
chasm sows 
it no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diverted by little beyond the walks to mention sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away 
march was to take elizabeth to hereford 
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither 
but marlott she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty 
absence had increased her desire of seeing chariot again and weakened her disgust 
of mr colling 
there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such companionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake 
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane 
and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay 
everything however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlotte’s 31st sketch 
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter 
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan beware perfect as plan could be 
pride and prejudice s the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the tint so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter 
the farewell between herself and mr william was perfectly friendly 
on his side even more 
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had n the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired 
and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bough and trusting their opinion of her 
their opinion of everybody 
would always coincide there was a solitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard 
and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and leading 
her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable 
sir william lugs and his daughter material a good-humoured girl but as empty-headed as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise 
elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir williams too long 
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood 
and his civilities were worn out like his intimation 
it was a journey of on went for miles and they began it so early as to in racechnrch street by noon 
as they drove to mr gardeners door jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival 
when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it beautiful and lovely as ever 
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerly for their cousins appearance would not allow them r 60 pride and prejudice 
to wait in the drawing-room and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower 
all was joy and kindness 
the day passed most pleasantly away 
the morning in hustle and shopping and the evening at one of the creatures 
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt 
their first subject was her sister 
and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute inquiry that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were rid of objection 
it was reasonable however to open that they would not continue long 
mrs gardener gave her the particulars also of miss hindley visit in gmcechurch street and repeated conventions occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance 
mrs gardener then rallied her niece on wickham’s desertion and corn directed her on hearing it so well 
a but my dear elizabeth 4 the added what sort of girl it miss king 
i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary 2 pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial airs between the mercenary and the incident motive 
where does discretion end and avarice begin 10 last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudently 
and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to and out that he is mercenary if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think a she is a very good kind of girl i believe 
i know no harm of her a but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune a no 
why should he 
if it were not allowance for him to gain my affections because i had no money mops and prejudice 
r so what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor 
a but there seems delicacy in directing his attention towards her so soon after this event 
d a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorum which other peor les ma observe 
if as does not object to it why should w p 2 her not 
objection does not justify fam 
it only shows her being deficient in something herself 
sense or feel 10 weir cried elizabeth 
have it as ou choose 
he shall he mercenary and b shall be too she d no dizzy that is what i do not choose 
i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in berkshire 
oh 
if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in berkshire 
and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better 
i am sick of them all 
thank heaven 
i am going to-morrow where i shall and a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him 
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all 
take care dizzy 
that speech savours strongly ole ointment before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer 
we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs gardeners but perhaps to the takes no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most lady and grateful 
am dear dear aunt she rapturously cried

let nur rat effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of mvellers.” chapter iii 
very object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to elizabeth 
and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment 
for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all ear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source a delight 
when they left the high road for the lane to hurtful every eye was in search of the parsonage and eve turning expected to bring it in view 
the paling of losing park was their boundary on one side 
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants 
at length the parsonage was discernible 
the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pals and the laurel hedge everything declared they were arriving 
mr cousins and chariot appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party 
in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing pride and prejudice 
149 at the sight of each other 
mrs colling welcomed her friend with the loveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received 
she saw instantly that her cousin manners were not altered by his marriage 
his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the ate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her arm y 
they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house 
and as soon as they were in the hour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wife's officers of refreshment 
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory 
and she could not help fancying that in i laying the good proportion of the room its aspect an 
its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him 
but though everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion 
when mr colling said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not seldom she involuntarily turned her eye on chariot 
once or twice she could discern a faint blush 
but in enemy chariot wisely did not hear 
after sitting on enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr hollis invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and no the cultivation of which he attended himself 
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures 
and elizabeth admired the command of 140 pride can prejudice 
countenance with which chariot talked of the halthfulneu of the exercise and owned the encouraged it at much at possible 
here leading the way through every walk and em walk and nearer allowing them an interval to utter the place be asked for every view we pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind 
he could number the field in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump 
but of all the vale which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rousing afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house 
it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground 
from his garden mr colling would have led them round hit two meadows 
but the ladies not having thou to encounter the remains of a white frost 
turned back 
and while sir william accompanied him chariot took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband 9 help 
all was rather snail but well built and convenient 
and everything wan fitted up and arranged with a weakness and consistent of which elizabeth gave chariot all the credit 
hen mr colling could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it elizabeth opposed he must be often forgotten 
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country 
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr colling dining in observed 
— yes miss elizabeth you wi l have the honour of seeing lady catherine de rough on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her 
she is all affability and concern and prejudice 
6d succession and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over 
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister marian in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here 
her behaviour to my dear marlott is charming 
we dine at roarings twice ever week and are never allowed to walk home 
her ladyship carriage is regularly ordered for us 
i shall say one of her ladyship carriages for she has several lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman inch 2 added chariot c and a most attentive neighbour a very true my dear that is exactly what i say 
she is the sort of woman whom one can not regard with too much deference the evening was spent chilly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written 
and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte’s degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and come sure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well 
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenure of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr cousins and the gaieties of their intercourse with roarings 
a lively imagination soon settled it all 
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion 
and after listening a moment she heard somebody mining upstairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her 
he opened the door and met marian in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out 
a oh my dear liza 
pray make haste and come 16a pride and pssjumcn 
into the dining-room for there is such a sight to be seen 
i will not tell you what it in 
make haste and come down this moment 
elizabeth naked questions in vain 
marriage would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the dining-room which from the lane in quest of this wonder 
it was two ladies stopping in a low phantom at the garden gate 
and ll this all 
a cried elizabeth 
l expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here it nothing but lady catherine and her daughter 
b c la 
my dear d said marian quite shocked at the mistake 2 it is not lady catherine 
the old lady is my jenkins who lives with them 
the other it miss de bough 
only look at her 
she is quite a little creature 
who would have thought she could be to thin and small 
a d she is abominable rude to keep chariot out of doors in all this wind 
why does she not come in i bob chastened it she hardly ever does 
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bough comes in 
d i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas 
she looks sickly and cross 
yes she will do for him very well 
she will make him a very pro rwifc.” r cousins and chariot were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies 
and sir william to elizabeth s high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bough looked that way 
at length there was nothing more to be said 
the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house 
mr colling no sooner saw the two girls than he to congratulate them on their good fortune which chariot explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at brings the next day 
pride and prejudice 16a put all 
r colling triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete 
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patron to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for 
and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough 
d i confess d said he 2 that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at roarings 
i rather expected from in knowledge of her affability that it would happen 
tint who could have foreseen such an attention as this 
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after our arrival 
b c am the less so revived at what has happened 2 replied sir william a room that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire 
about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon scarce anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to roarings 
mr colling was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpowered them 
when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth 
a do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel 
lady catherine is farm ready run an prejudicial 
quitting that elegance of drains us which come here and daughter 
i would advise you merely to put 
on whatever of your clothes in upon to the rent 
there in no occasion for anything more 
lady catherinewillnotthinktheworleofyouforbein imply dreaded 
she liked have the distinction of rank renewed 
hide they were dressing he came two or three times to their different door to recommend their being quick an lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner 
such formidable account of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened marian lucy who had been little need to county and she looked forward to her introduction at cling with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st jam s 
all the weather was line they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park 
every park ban in beauty and it prospects 
and elizabeth raw much to he pleased with though arc could not he in such rapture as mr colling expected the scene to inspire and war but lightly affected by his enunciation of the window in front of the house and hit relation of what the blazing altogether had originally cost sir lower c bough 
when they ascended the steps to the hall marian's alarm was every moment increasing 
and even sir william did not look perfectly calm 
elizabeth’courage did not fail her 
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talent or miraculous virtue and the mere uatelineu of money and rank the thought the could witness without trepidation 
from the entrance-gate of which mr colling intend out with a rapture air the one proportion and indeed omarnenta they followed the servantry through an anteprune and inhuman 
6d chamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs jenkins were sitting 
her lady with great condescension arose to receive them 
an as mrs colling had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of t sex apology and thanks which he would have thought my 
in spite of having been at st james sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his sent without saying a word 
and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses rat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look 
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly 
— lady catherine was a tall large woman with strongly-marked features which might once have been handsome 
her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank 
she was not rendered formidable by silence 
but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her selfimportance and brought mr wicker immediately to elizabeth mind 
and horn the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented 
when after examining the mother in whose countenance and department she soon found some resemblance of mr dairy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in marian astonishment at her being so thin an so small 
there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies 
miss de bough was pale and sickly 
her features though not plain were insignificant 
and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs 16a pride and prejudicial 
jenkins in whole appearance there was nothing remarkable and who wax entirely engaged in listening to what the maid and placing a career in the proper direction before her eyes 
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the window to admire the view mr colling attending them to point out its beautiful and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer 
the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the tenants and all the article of plate which mr colling had promised 
and an he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table h her lad ship's desire and looked at if he felt that i' could with nothing greater 
he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity 
and every dish was commended rest by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever he eon-inlaw aid in i manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear 
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave tom gracious mile especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them 
the party did not apply much convention 
elizabeth war ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she war seated between charlie and miss de bough 
the former of whom wan engaged in listening to lady catherine and the letter said not a word to her all dinner-time 
man mention war chiefly employed in watching how little minx de bough ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing the was disposed 
marian thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire 
when the ladies returned to the drawing-room there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intention till coffee came pride and prejudice 
6d in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment contravene 
she inquired into charlotte’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as so the management of them all 
told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry 
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others 
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs colling she addressed a variety of questions to marian and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connection she knew the least and who she observed to mrs colling was a very genteel pretty kind of girl 
she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mother maiden name 
— 
elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly 
— 
lady catherine then observed a your father s estate is entailed on mr colling i think 
for your sake a turning to marlott d i am glad of it 
but otherwise i see no occasion for unfailing estates from the female line

your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters

no governess 
row was that possible 
five daughters brought up at home without a governess 
i never heard of such a thing 
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case 
a then who taught you 
who attended to you 
without a governess you must have been neglected 2 compared with some families i believe we were 
but circle of us as wished to learn never wanted the means 
we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary 
those who chose to be idle certainly might 
a aye no doubt 
but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one 
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it 
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of applying in that way 
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out 
four pieces of mrs jenkins are most delightfully situated through my means 
and it was but the rum my prejudices

your younger sisters must be very young 
d ye my youngest is not sixteen 
perhaps as is full young to be much in company 
but really ma'am i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the mane or inclination to marry early 
the last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first 
and to be kept back on m a motive 
i think it would not he very bitter to provoke bitterly affection or delicacy of mind upon my word d said her ladyship b you give your opinion very decidedly for so young 3 person 
ray what is your age 9 e with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it 
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer 
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to tried with i much dignified impertinence 
you can not be more than twenty i am sure 
therefore you need not conceal your age d i am not one-and‘twenty.” when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was i. m

over the card-tables were laced 
lady catherine sir william and mr and mrs colling sat down to quadrille 
and as miss de bough chose to play at causing the two girls had the honour of adding men jenkins to make up her any 
their was superlativer t if 
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not re to n the game except when my jenkins expressed her fears of miss de boughs being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light 
a great deal more awed at the other table 
lady catherine was general y speaking 
stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself 
mr colling was employed in agreeing to everything her lad ship said thanking her for every she he won and apron gieing if he thought he won too many 
sir william did not say much 
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names 
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as chose the tables were broken up the carriage was of bred to mrs colling gratefully accepted and immediately ordered 
the party then gathered round the free to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the marrow 
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach 
and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr colling side and as many bows on sir williams they d rafted 
as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at roarings which for charlotte’s sake she made more favourable than it really was 
but her commendation though closing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr cousins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship praise into his own hands 
pride and prejudice

hum 10 
i william bayed only a week at hereford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably rattled and of her possessing such a hundred and such a neighbour us were not often met with 
while sir william w with them mr colling devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country 
but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to and that that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in riding and writing and looking out of window in his own cloak-room which fringed the road 
the room in which the ladies at was backwards 
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that chariot should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use 
it was a better prized room and had a pleasanter aspect 
but she noon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what the did for mr colling would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had sat in one wall lively 
and she gave chariot it for the meggemyenl y from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr calling for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially mine de bough drove by in her phlegm which he never failed coming to inform them of thou h it happened almost every day 
she not frequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with marlott but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out 
very few day 
passed in which mr colling did not 
izz pride and pkbjudici’ 
walk to rappings and not may in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise 
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family living to he of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours 
new and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits 
she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently 
found fault with the arrangement of the creature or detected the housemaid in negligence 
and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of india out that mrs colling joints of meat were too large or her family 
elizabeth soon perceived that though thin great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county the was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr colling 
and whenever any of the cottagers were diet be quarrels discontented or too poor she tallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty 
the entertainment of dining at ratting was repeated about twice a week 
and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one creditable in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first 
their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinsea’ reach 
this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough 
there were half-tones of pleasant conversation with charlie and the weather was so one for the time of ear that she had often great enjoyment out of doors 
idle favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on pride and prejudicial 
17 lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity 
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away 
easter was approaching and the week yin-“needhg it was to bring an addition to the family at a which in so in circle must be moment 
elizabeth had heard noon after her arrival that mr dairy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their ravings parties and she might be unused in seeing how hopeless miss hindley's designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest swindon and seemed almost an ray to and that 
he had already been frequently seen by is lugs and herself 
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage 
for mr colling was walking the whole morning within view of the lodge opening into hereford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence 
on the following morning he hastened to roarings to ay his respects 
there were two nephews of lady otherwise to hire them for mr dairy had brought with him a and fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord 
— and to the great surprise of all the party when mr colling returned the gentlemen accompanied him 
marlott had seen them from her husband's room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding 
its pride and preju‘dlcl‘ 
d i may thank you size for this piece of civility 
mr party would never have come to soon to wait upon me elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaimed all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door-bell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room 
colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in n and address most truly the gentleman 
mr e looked as he had been used to look in hertfordshire 
paid hit compliments with his usual reserve to mrs cousins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure 
elizabeth merely conveyed to him without saying a word 
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-formed man and talked v pleasantly 
but his cousin after having addressed relight observation on the house and garden to my calling sat for some time without spaulding to anybody 
at length however his civility was so far awakened as to inquired of elizabeth after the health of her family 
she answered him in the usual way and after a momentary pause added 
— a my eldest sister has been in town these three months 
here you never happened to see her there 
d she was perfectly sensible that he never had 
but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the basin loyal and jane and she thought he looked a little corn n he answered that he had never been so fortunate as so meet miss bonnet 
the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away 
pride and prejudice 85 that asses 
colonel f itzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at roarings 
it was some days however before the received an invitation thither 
for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary 
and it was not till yesterday almost a week after the gentleman's arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening 
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter 
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr darch they had only seen at church 
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour the lined the party in lady catherine's drawing-room 
er ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else 
and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to fancy much more than to any other person in the morn 
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them 
an thing was a welcome relief to him at roarings 
and colling retty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much 
he now seated himself by her and talked so greatly of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before 
and they conversed with so much spirit and now as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr darch 
his eyes had been 10 r 7s turns and rambles 
soon and repute turned towards them with a look of curiosity 
and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple e to call out 
“whatisthat you are g fitzwilliam 
what is it you are talking of

let me hear what it is a we are speaking of music madam 2 aid he when no longer able to avoid a reply

i must have my share in the conversation i you are speaking of music 
there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste 
if i had ever lax i should have been a grunt proficient 
and so would annie if her health had allowed her to lap lay 
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully 
how does georgian get an darch 
mr darch spoke with affectionate of his sister's proficiency 
i am very glad to hear such a good account of her a mid lady catherine 
and pray tell her from me that she can not expect to excess if she does not practise a great deal i assure you madam 2 he replied that she does not need such advice 
she practised very constantly 
a so much the better 
it can not be done too much 
and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect 
it on any account 
i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be an altered without constant practice 
i have told miss net several times that she will never plays really well unless she practised more 
and though s calling has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to roarings every day and play on the pinafore run

31 elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to one while my calling and marian were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor 
ai she had heard no carriage the thought it not unlikely to he lady catherine and under that apprehension wan putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr dairy and mr fancy only entered the room 
he seemed monied too on wending her alone and apologized for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within 
they then sat down and when her inquiries after rowing were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence 
it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting urban she had seen him last in herefordshire 
and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hast departure the allowed 
a how ever and only you all quitted nethcrﬁeld last november r darch 
it must have been a most agreeable prize to mr hindley to lee you all after him to noon 
for if i recollect right he went but the day before 
he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london to a perfectly 90 i thank you mops and prejudice 
1801 she found that she was to receive no other answer and after 3 short pause added 
d i think i have understood that mr hindley has not much ism of ever returning to tethered a in i d i have never heard him an so 
but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future 
he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing d if he means to be but little at tethered it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we wi t possibly get i settled family there 
but perhaps r bring did not take the house so much for the convenience office neighbour as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same prince ee i should not be surprised a said fancy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase oﬂ'erl.” elizabeth made no answer 
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend 
and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of sending a subject to him 
he took the hint and soon began with a this seems a very comfortable house 
lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr colling first came to hunsford.” i believe she did 
and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object 
a mr colling appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife a yes indeed 
his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him ha y if they had 
my friend has an excellent understand ling 
though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collars as the wisest thing she ever did 
she seems is pride and prejudice 
perfectly happy however 
and in a prudential light it in certainly a very good match for her 
it maybe very agreeabletohertobenettled within so only a dance of her own family and friend a an cosy dinner do you call it 
it is nearly fifty mile ... c and what is fifty miles of cod road 
little more than half a day's journey 
as i call it a very easy distance a i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantage of the match cried elizabeth 
d i should never ha laid my calling was settled near her family 10 a t in a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire 
anything beyond the very neighbourhood of longboum i suppose would appear far as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood 
he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and tethered and she blushed as the answered 
i do not mean to any that a woman may not be ended too near her family 
the far and the near must he relative and depend on many varying circumstances 
where there it fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil 
but that in not the case bare 
mr and my calling have a comfortable income but not such a one at will allow of frequent joumeys-and i am waded my friend would not call herself near her family y under less than bay the pretext distance 
mr darch drew his chair a little towards her and aid a tap can not have a right to such very strong local attachment 
you can not lave been always at lion turned e both looked sin-prized 
the gentleman experipride and prejudice 
1801 ended some change of feeling 
he drew back his chair took a new apart from the table and glancing over it said in a co deer voice 
a are you pleased with kent 
d a short dialogue on the subject of the county ensued on either side calm and concise 
and soon put an end to by the entrance of marlott and her sister just returned from their walk 
the main surprise them 
mr darch reach the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bonnet and after sitting a few minutes longer without crying much to anybody went away 
what can be the meaning of this 
said chariot as soon as he was gone 
a my dear size he mun be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar ways but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlotte’s wishes to be the case 
and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of sending anything to do which was the more probable from the time of year 
all old sports were over 
within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard-table but gentlemen can not be always within doors 
and in the weariness of the parsonage or the unpleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this rind of walking thither almost every day 
they called at various times of the morning sometimes separated sometimes to other and now and then accompanied by their aunt 
was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more 
and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wicker 
and 104 pride and prejudice 
though in comparing them all law there was less mitigating oftener in colonel fitzwilliam’l manners 
she believed he might have the heat informed mind 
but why mr dairy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand 
it could not be for society an he frequently last there ten minutes together without opening his lips 
and when he did speak it adorned the effect of necessity rather than of choice 
a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself 
he seldom appeared really animated 
mrs colling knew not what to make of him 
colonel fitzwilliam’s occasionally lane ring at his stupidity proved that was generally i event which her own knowledge of him could not have told her i and an the would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend liza she set herself seriously to work to and it out 
she watched him whenever they were at roaring and whenever he came to hereford 
but without much success 
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disreputable 
it was an earnest steadfastly gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind 
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea 
and mrs colling did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment 
for in her opinion it admitted not of doubt that all her friend s dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power 
n her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes leaned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam 
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man 
he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible 
name and prejudicial 
1801 but to counterbalance these advantages mr dairy had considerable patersons in the church and his cousin could have none at l 
child 
ﬁﬁﬁlll one than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the rick unexpectedly meet mr darch 
she felt the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to meat in ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers 
how it could occur a second time therefore 
was very odd 
yet it did and even the third 
it seemed like wilful ill-nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a new formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought 
it necessary to turn back and walk with her 
he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much 
but it struck her in the course of their third rencounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions 
about her pleasure in being at hunsfnrd her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr and mrs colling happiness 
and that in speaking of musings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying that too 
his words seemed to imply it 
could he have colonel fitzwilliaml in his thoughts 
she supposed if he meant anything he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that carter 
it distressed her a little and she was quite l to and herself at the gate in the pale opposite the parsonage 
she was engaged one day as she walked in 
perusing i. n 1869 pride and prejudice 
james last letter and dwelling on some page which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr dairy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was seeing her 
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a mile she aid i did not know before that you ever walked this way i have been making the tour of the park a he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage 
are you going much farther 
d no i should have turned in a moment 
and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together 
do you certainly leave kent on saturday 2 said she 
yes 
if darch does not put it off again 
but i am at his disposal 
he arrange the business just as he pleases c and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice 
i do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darch 2 he likes to have his own way very well a replied colonel fitzwillianl 
but so we all do 
it is only that he has better man of having it than many others because he is rich and many other are poor 
i speak feeling 
a younger son you know must benumbed to self 
denial and dependence in my iron the younger son of an earl can know very li e of either 
now seriously what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence 
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for 
ears mao shower 
1801 2 these are home questions 
and perhaps i can not say that l have experienced many hardships of that nature 
but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money 
younger sons can not marry where they like sunless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do 
a our habits of expense make us too dependent and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money 2 is this a thought elizabeth meant for me i 
and she coloured at the idea 
but recovering herself aid in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an early younger son 10 unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped to interrupt a silence which might make him face her affected with what had passed she soon after d said 
d i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal 
i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind 
but perhaps his sister does as well or the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her a no said colonel f william that is an advantage which he must divide with me 
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darch 
a are you indeed 
and pray what sort of guardians do you make 
does your charge give you much trouble 
young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficulty to manage and if she has the true darch spirit she may like to have her own way 
as the spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly 
and the manner in which he immediately asked 1858 pride and rnuunrcr 
her why ill 
suppose mite darch likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that oh had somehow or other pretty near the truth 
she directly replied 
a on need not be frightened

from something that he told me in our journey hither i have remain to think hindley very much indebted to him 
but i ought to beg hint pardon for i have no right to suppose that hindley was the person meant 
it wan all conjectured that it it you mean 
a it is a circumstance which diary of course could not wish to be really known because if it were to round to the lady family it would bean unpleasant thing 
a ou may depend upon my not mentioning it and remember that i have not much reason for opposing it to be hindley 
what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudently marriage but without mentioning names or any other particular are and i only suspected it to be hindley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer pride and prejudicial 1890 did mr darch give you his rear for this interference 
a d i understood that there were tome very strong objection against the lady 
and what am did he use to separate them 
he did not talk to me office own arm a maid fitzwilliam smiling 
a he only told me what i have now told a made no newer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation 
after watching her a little fitzwilliarn asked her why the was so thoughtful 
i am thinking of what you have been telling me said he 
a your cousin conduct daniel not quit my feeling 3 
why was he to he the judge 
b c on are rather disposed to call him interference opinion 
i do not see what right mr dairy had to decide on the propriety of hit friendly inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend wan to be happy 
but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him 
it in not to be supposed that there war much affection in the camel 2 that in not an unnatural surmise d if f william but it is lessening the honour of my cousin triumph ve sadly fulfil was spoken jestingly 
but it appeared to her no just a picture of mr diary that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matter 
till they reached the parsonage

it was not to be supposed that any other people could he meant than thou with whom the wur connected

there could not exist in the world in men over whom mr darch could have such boundless influence 
that he had been concerned in the means taken to operate mr hindley and jane the had never doubted 
but the had always attributed to mint bringing the principal design and arrangement of them 
if his own unity however did not missed him be was the cause hit pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had millar and still continued to utter 
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the more 
affectionate generous heart in the world 
and no one could my how lasting an evil he might have inflicted 
there were some very strong objection against the lady a were colonel fitzwilliam’n word 
and these mang objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in bring in london 
c to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection 
all loveliness and goodness i the is 
her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manner cultivating 
neither could anything be urged against my father who though with mine peculiarities 7th qualities which mr darch himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach 
when she thought of her brother indeed her confidence gave wary a little 
but would not allow that any objection her had material weight with mr darch whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the went of importance in his friends connection than from their want of sense

hen they were gone elizabeth ll if intending to exasperate herself a much as 
he against mr darch chose for her em torment the examination of all the letter 
which one had written to her since her being in kent 
they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present clustering 
but in all and in almost every line of each there wan a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at cane with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded 
elizabeth noticed every sentence convex nag the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it hardly received on the first perused 
mr darch shameful bout of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her iieter’a iuil'eringa 
it was come consolation to think that till visit to rueing was to end on the day after the next 
and a still greater that in less than a night he should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do 
she could not think of days leaving kent with 
s pride and prejudice 
out remembering that his cousin was to go with him 
but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him 
while settling this point she was suddenly mused by the sound of the door and her fruits were a little hurried by the idea of its being cuz one fitzwilliarn himself who had once before calf ed late in the evening and might now come to inquire particularly after her 
but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently acted when to her utter amazement she saw mr darch walk into the room 
in a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health improving his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better 
she answered him with cold civility 
he t down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room 
elizabeth was surprised but said not a word 
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began 
a in vain have i struggled 
it will not do 
my feelings will not be dressed 
you must allow me to tell on how ardently admire and love you elizabeth astonishment was beyond expression 
she stared coloured doubted and was silent 
this he considered sufficient encouragement 
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed 
he spoke well 
but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more also not on the subject of tenderness than of pride 
is sense of her inferiority 
of its being a degradation 
of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with s warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was bounding but was very unlikely to recommend his slut 
pride and prejudice 
7 in spite of her deep-rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive 
till roused to resentment by hisseln sequence language she lost all corn simon in anger 
she tried however to compose hearse f to answer him with patience when he should have done 
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer 
and with pressing his ho that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand 
as he said this she could equal see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer 
e spelt of a profession and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security 
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said 
a in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequalled they run he returned 
it is natural that obligation should be t and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you 
but i can not 
i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly 
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one 
it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration 
the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this ax damnation 
r darch who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise 
his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature 
he was struck pride and prejudice going for the nap assurance of composure and would not of n his lips till e believed himself to have attained it 
he pause was so elizabeth s feelings dreadful 
at length in a voice of forced calmness he said 
e and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting 
i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little maw at civility i am thus rejected 
but it is of small importance d i might as well inquire 2 replied she d why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will a against your reason and even against your character 
as not this some excuse for civility if i was uncivil but i have other provocation 
you know i have 
had not my own feelings decided against you 
— had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister 2 b c as she pronounced these words mr darch changed colour 
but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued 
i have every reason in the world to think ill of you 
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted bare 
you dare not you can not deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other exposing one to the centre of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed ho s and involving them both in misery of the act kind 
she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse 
he even looked at her with s smile of affected incredulity 
a can you deny that you have done it 
d she repeated 
pride and prejudice 9 with assumed tranquillity he then replied a i ham no wish of denying that i did everything in in power to separate my friend from our sister or that rejoice in my success 
towards i have been kinder than towards myself 
elizabeth distanced the appearance of noticing this civil reflections but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliating her 
a but it is not merely this ironic d she continued a on which my dislike is founded 
long before it had taken place my s none of you was decided 
your character was unfit dad in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wicker 
on this subject what can you have to say 
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself 
or under what representation em you here impose upon others 2 
you take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns said diary in a less tranquil tone and with a he hastened colour 
a ho that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him 
his misfortunes 
repeated darch contemptuously 
eyes his misfortunes have been great indeed 
and of your inspection 2 cried elizabeth with energy 
b you hm reduced him to his present state of poverty 
comparative poverty 
you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him 
you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert 
you have done all this 
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridiculing land this a cried dairy as he walked with dick steps across the room is your opinion of me his is the station in which you hold me 
i thank you to pride and prejudice 
for explaining it so fully 
my faults according to this calculations are heavy indeed 
but 
perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her 
a these offences might have been over looked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design 
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my strong les and pattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination 
by reason by selection by everything 
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence 
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related 
they were natural and just 
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connection i 
w congratulate myself on the ho of relations whose condition in life is so decide y beneath my own 
a elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment 
yet she tried to the utmost to speak with come sure when she said 
— a on are mistaken mr fancy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentlemanly manner 
d she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued 
b you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it again his astonishment was obvious 
and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification 
she went on 
d from the very beginning 
from the first moment i my almost say 
of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your pride and prejudice 
ll arrogance your conceit and your relish disdain of the feelings of others 
were such as to form that groundwork of relation on which succeeding events hue built so immovable i dislike 
and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the in man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to m i 
on have said quite enough madam 
i really comprehend your feelings and have now of y to be ashamed of what my own have been 
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and ha pines 
and with these words he has y left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the home 
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great 
she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half-an-hour 
her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it 
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darch 
that he should have been in love with her for so many months 
— so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister and which must appear at least with uri force in his own case 
was almost incredible 
it was gratified sing to have inspired unconsciously so strong an a none 
but his pride his abominable pride 
his lameness avowal of what he had done with respect to jane 
his pardonable assurance in acknowledgment though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wicker his cruelty towards whom he had not attempt tend to deny soon overcame the city which the conflict emotion of his attachment had her a moment excited 
she continued in very cogitating reflections 120 pride and prejudice 
till the sound of lady catherine's carriage made her feel how one wall she was to encounter charlotte’s observation an hurried her away to her room 
than 
7th 
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes 
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened 
it was impossible to think of anything else 
and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise 
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr darch sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike-road 
the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground 
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the unpleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the rick 
the cave weeks which she had now passed in end had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees 
she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a grim sea of a gentleman within the sort of grove which get the park 
he was moving that way 
and fearful of its being mr dairy she was directly retreating 
but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepped forward with eagerness pronounced her name 
he had me away 
but on hearing herself called 
though in a voice my ma s 
2 pride and prejudice 
3 which proved it to be mr dairy she moved again towards the ate 
he had by that time reached it also and hold in out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you 
will you do me the honour of reading that 
letter 
e and then with a slight how turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight 
with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still-increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper written quite through in a very close hand 
the envelope itself was likewise full 
pursuing her way along the lane she then began it 
it was dated from sings at eight o'clock in the morning and was as follows 
d be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any re ration of those sentiments or renewal of those offers w inch were last night so disgusting to you 
i write without any intention of praising you or rumbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the ha illness of both can not be too soon forgotten and the e on which the formation and the pedestal of this letter must occasion should have been red had not my character required it to be written an read 
you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention 
your ling i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice 
a two offences a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge 
the ﬁrst-mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr hindley from your sister 
and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity 140 ram arm shower 
ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospect of mr wicker 
wildly and wanting to ve thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence n on our carnage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would he a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks 
could bear no comparison 
ut from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall ho to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read 
if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry 
the necessity must be obeyed and further apology would be absurd 
i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that tingly preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country 
but it was not till the evening of the dance at tethered that i had any ape retention of his feeling a serious attachment 
i had of ten seen him in love before 
at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william outcasts accidental information that hindley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their meaning 
he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided 
from that moment i observed my friends behaviour‘attentively 
and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bonnet was be and what i had ever witnessed in him 
your sister also watched 
her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced pride and prejudice 
150 from the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any anticipation of sentiment 
if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error 
your superior knowed e of your sister must make the latter probable 
— if it so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable 
but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer 10 conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched 
that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain 
but i will venture to say that my investigations and decision are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears 
i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it 
— i believed it on imperial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason 
my directions to the marriage were not merely those which last night acknowledged to have required the utmost fame of passion to put aside in my own case 
the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me 
but there were other causes of repugnance 
— causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances had myself endeavoured to lo eft because they were not immediately before me 
these causes must be stated though briefly 
the situation of your mother family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that tour want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father 
pardon me 
it pains me to offend you 
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like measure is praise no less 16a mum and prejudice 
generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and desolation of both 
i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every enticement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection 
he left tethered for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning 
the art which i acted is now to be explained 
his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own 
our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in reaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london 
we accordingly went 
and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice 
i described and enforced them eagerly 
but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been accorded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister indifference 
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard 
but hindley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own 
to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point 
to persuade him against returning into herefordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment 
i can not blame myself for having done thus much 
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not respect with satisfaction 
it is that i descended to adopt the measures of art no far as to conceal from him your sister being in town 
i knew it myself as it was known to miss magley 
but her brother is pride and prejudice 
is even at ignorant of it 
that they might have met without i l consequence is perhaps probable 
but his did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger 
perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me 
it is done however and it was done for the best 
on this subject have nothing more to say no other apology to offer 
if i have wounded your sister feelings it was unknowingly done 
and though the motives which governed me my to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them 
e with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr wicked i can only refute it by laying fore on the whole of his connection with my family 
o what he has singularly accused me i am ignorant 
but of the true of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted verdict 
a r william is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the embers estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his most naturally inclined my father to be of service to him 
and on george wicker who was his golden his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed 
my father supported him at school and words at cambridge 
most irnpommt assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman education 
my father was not only fond of this young man's society whose manners were always engaging 
he had also the highest of iron of him and hoping the church would be his pro passion intended to provide for him in it 
as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner 
the vicious propensities-the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best u. n 1100 
l 85 pride and prejudice 
friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in un warded moments which mr darch could not have 
here again i shall give you pain 
to what degree you onlydcan tell 
but whatever may be the sentiments which r wicked has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real characterize a das even another motive 
a my excellent father died about live years ago 
and his attachment to mr william was to the late so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to provoke his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow 
and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant 
there was also a licence of one thousand pounds 
his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr wicker wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not 
think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate peculiar advantage in life of the performed by which he co d not be beheaded 
he had some intention he added of study nag the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein 
i rather wished than believed him to be sincere 
hut at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal 
i knew that mr wicker ought not to be a clergyman 
the business was therefore soon settled 
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds 
all connection between us seemed now dissolved 
i thought too ill of him to invite him to temperly or admit his society in town 
in town i believe he chiefly lived but his pride and prentice 
19 studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation 
for about three years i heard little of him 
but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation 
his circumstances he assured me and 10 had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad 
he had than the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question 
of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered father s intentions 
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for desisting every repetition of it 
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances 
and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me so others as in his reproaches to myself 
after this mood every appearance of acquaintance was dropped how he lived i know not 
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice 
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being 
having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy 
m sister who is more than ten years my junior was led to the guardianship of my mother s nephew colonel fitzwillinm and myself 
about a year a she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london 
and last summer she went with the lady who preside over it to ramsgate 
and thither also went mr wicker undoubtedly by design 
for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs young in whose character we were most unhappily deceived 
and by her comic pride and prejudice 
advance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgian whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement 
she was then but after which must be her excuse 
and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself 
my joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgian unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked it to as a father acknowledged the whole to me 
you may imagine what i felt and how acted 
regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure 
but i wrote to mr wicker who left the place immediately and mrs younger was of course removed from her charge 
mr wickham’s chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune which is thirty thousand pounds 
but i can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inclement 
his revenge would have been complete indeed 
this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together 
and if you do not absolute reject it as false you will i hope acquit me hence 27th of cruelty towards mr wicker 
i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you 
but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either 
deception could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination 
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night 
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed 
for the truth of everything here related i can appeal pride and prejudice 
2 
more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliarn who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the execution of my father will has been unavoidably a united with every particular of these transactions 
i your abhorrence of in 
should make in assertions vagueness you can not be prevented by the same cause from come no in my cousin 
and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to and some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning 
i will only add god bless you 
a finwruusm dame 
cast ﬁﬁﬁhj 
f elizabeth when mr darch gave her the letter i did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents 
but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited 
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined 
with amazement did she burst understand that he believed any apology to be in his power 
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he on d have no explanation to ice which a sense of shame would not cone 
with a strong prejudice against everything he might say she began his account of what had happened at tethered 
she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension 
and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes 
his belief of her sister s sensibility she instantly resolved to be false 
and his account of the real the worst objections 120 hale and prejudice 
to the match made her too angry to have any with of doing him justice 
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her 
his style was not penitence but haughty 
it was all pride and insolence 
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wicker 
when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true matt overthrow eve cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so a ring an ability to his own history of himself 
her feeling s were yet more acutely painful and more difficulty of derision 
astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her 
she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming 2 this must be false this can not be 
this must be the grosser falsehood 
— and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that the would never look in it again 
in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on 
but it would not do 
in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying refusal of all that related to wicked and commanded herself to far as to examine the meaning of eve sentence 
the account of his connection with the embers family was exactly what he had related himself 
and the kindness of the late mr dearly though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words 
so far each recital confirmed the other 
but when she came to the will the difference was great 
what william had said of the king was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicate on one side or the other 
and for a few moments the flattered herself that her wishes did pride and prejudice

the extravagance and general privacy which he scraped not to lay to mr icltham’s chair exceedingly shocked her 
the more so as she to 10 
bring no roof of its injustice 
she had never heard of him fore his entrance into the

she tried to collect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr darch 
or at least by the prominence of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr dairy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance

at one time the had almost resolved an apple sing to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr fancy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin corroboration 
she perfectly remembered everything that had in conversation between wicket and her in their first evening at mr phillipa'a 
many of his expreaaioru were still fresh in her memory 
she wan new muck with the impropriety of inch communication to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before 
she law the delicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his profession with his conduct 
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darch 
that mr fancy might leave the country but that be should stand his ground yet he had avoided the tethered ball the very next week 
she remembered also that till the netherlield family had quitted the country he had told his nay to no one but herself 
but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed 
that he had then no deserve no temples in linking mr darch character pride and prejudice 
25 thou h he had assured her that re cat for the father you d always prevent his exposing e son 
how differently did everything now a bear in which he was concerned i his attentions to bliss king were now the consequence of views solely and carefully mercenary 
and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eager lo group at anything 
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive 
he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed s 2 had more incautiously shown 
everything ring struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter 
an in farther uttiﬁcation of mr dairy she could not but allow that i mingled when questioned by jane had 1801 ago asserted his carelessness in the affair

that even william had allowed him merit as brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionate of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling 
that had hit actions been what wicker represented them so gross a visitation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world 
and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr hindley was incomprehensible 
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself

mr fancy only for a few minutes to take leave 
but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found

colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object 
she could think only of her letter

peace of their appealing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lamer gone through at roi‘lllgl 
to roarings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her days her 
and on his return brought back with great satin action a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her 
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece 
nor could she think without a smile of what her lawyer ship's indignation would have been 
what would she have said i 
how would she have behaved 
were questions with which she amused herself their first subject was the diminution of the roarings army 
i assure on i feel it exceedingly said eddy catherine 
a believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do 
but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me 
they were excessively to go 
but so they always are 
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last 
but darkly seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year 
his attachment to roarings certainly increases mr colling had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter 
lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bonnet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added 
a but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer 
mrs colling will be very glad of your company i am sure a i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind pride and prejudice 250 invitation 2 replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept in i must be in town next saturday 
away at that rate you will have been here only six weeks 
i expected you to stay two months 
i told mrs collars so before you came 
there can he no occasion for your going so soon 
mrs bonnet could certainly spare ou for another fortnight 
but my father can not 
he wrote last week to hurry my return 
a oh 
your father of course may spare you if your mother can 
daughters are never of so much consequence to a father 
and if you will era another mall 
complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week 
and as daws does not object to the borough 
box 
there will be very good room for one of you 
and indeed if the weather should ha to be cool i should not object to taking you ho as are neither of you large you are all kindness madam 
but i believe we must abide by our original plan 
lady catherine seemed resigned 
a mrs colling you must send a servant with them 
you know i always speak my mind and i can not hear the idea of two long women travelling post by themselves 
it is high improper 
you must contrive to send somebody 
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing 
young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life 
when my niece georgian went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two mensemnts go with her 
miss fancy the daughter of mr diary of temperly and lady anyone could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner 
i am excessively attentive to all those things

31 manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil 
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and ladies 
but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence what chance could there be of improvement 
catherine mean-minded irritable and completely under lists guidance had been always aﬁ‘ronted by their advice 
and ladies self-willed and careless would scarcely give them a hearing 
they were ignorant idle and vain 
while there was an office in hareton they would flirt with him 
and while norton was within a walk of longboum they would be going there for ever 
anxiety on panels behalf was another prevailing concern 
and mr darch explanation by restoring hindley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost 
his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicates of his conscience in his friend 
how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for ha pines jane had been deprived by the folly and in chorus of her own family 
when to these recollections was added the development of william s character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost him be for her to appear tolerate cheerful 
heir engagements at roarings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first 
the very last evening was spent there 
and her ladyship again inquired mine into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that marian thought herds pride and prejudice 
self obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh 
when they pained lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hereford again next year 
and miss de bough exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both 
than a 11:30 
n saturday morning elizabeth and mr colling met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared 
and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensable necessary 
i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs colling has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us 
but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it 
the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you 
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode 
our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hereford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself 
but i hope you all believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness 
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment 
and the pleasure of being with charlie and the kind attentions she had received must make her feel the obliged 
mr colling was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied 
— sung and prejudicial 
31 2 it vex me the test leisure to hear that have passed your rigs 
not disagreeably 
we haze certain y done our best 
and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to superior society and from our connection with gongs the f vent means of varying the humble home scene i thin we may fatter ourselves that your hereford visit can not have been entirely irksome 
our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast 
you see on what a footing we are 
you see how continually we are engaged there 
in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are shores of our intimacy at rosiness words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings 
and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences 
b you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin 
i fatter myself at least that you will be able to do so 
lady catherine's great attentions to mrs colling you have been a daily witness of 
and altogether i trust it does not a air that your friend has drawn an unfortunate ut on this point it will be as well to be silent 
only let me assure you my dear mist elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordial wish you equal felicity in marriage 
my dear chair one and i have but one mind and one way of thinking 
there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us 
we seem to have been designed for each other elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity 10 
c 104 pride and prejudice sourly add that the army believed and rejoiced in his tlurrreutic comfort 
she war not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the led from whom they sprang 
poor chariot 
it wur me rrnehnly to leave her to such society but she had broken it with her eyes open 
and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to rock fur companion 
her home and her housekeeping 
her pariah and her poultry and all their dependent concern had not yet lost their charm 
at length the chuckle arrived the trunk were fastened an the parcel placed within and it was pronounced to be ready 
after an affectionate parting between the ii‘iendi elizabeth we attended to the carriage by mr bullion rind on they walked down the garden he was enmmiuionin her with his best respects to all her family nut forgetting hit thanks for the kinder he hurl received at longbourn in the winter and hit compliments to mr rind mirror gardener though unknown 
let then turned her in marian followed and the door we on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of glorying 
a slut he added b you will of course wish to have your humble respect 
delivered to them with your grateful than a for their kindness to you while you have been here 
elizabeth made no objection 
the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off 
a good gracious 
cried marian after a few minutes' silence a it seems 
but a day or two since we first came l 
and yet how many things have happened 
d a great many indeed a said her companion with a sigh 
we have dined nine times at roarings besides drinking tea there twice 
how much i shall have to tell 
pride and prejudice 
elizabeth private added and how much i shall have to conceal l 2 their 
journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm 
and within four hours of their leaving hereford they reached mr gardener s house where they were to remain a few days 
jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them 
but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation 
it was not without an effort mean while that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr darch ropers 
to know that she had the power of revel in what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to o etc as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she would communicate 
and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of hindley which might only grieve her sister further

it it excellent nowt

and about a certain person that we all like i d jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not nay 
ladies laughed and said 
maybe that ll just like your formality and discretion 
you thought the waiter must not hear at if he cared 
i dare lay he often hears worse things said than i am going to say 
but he is an ugly fellow l i am glad he it gone 
i never saw such a long chin in my life

it is about dear william 
too god for the waiter in not it 
there in no danger of ickham’s marrying mary king 
there a for you i she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay

added elizabeth 
a safe from a connection imprudently an to fortune a she is a great fool for going away if she liked him a but i hope there ll no strong attachment on either side d said jane 
d i am sure there is not on mr 
i will answer for it he never cared three raw about her 
who can about such a nasty little freckled thing 
a elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of marian herself the coarseness of the judgment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal 
as soon an all had ate and the elder one paid the carriage was ordered 
and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes work-bags and freely and the unwelcome addition of kites and diary purchases were seated in it 
a how nicely we are crammed in a cried india 
1801 pride and prejudicial 
d i am glad bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another barndoor i well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home 
and in the first place let us hear what's happened to you all since you went away 
have you seen any pleasant men 
have you had any flirting 
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back 
jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare 
she is almost three-and-twentyl lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three-and-twentyl my aunt pips wants you so to get husbands you can't think 
she says izz had better have taken mr colling 
but i do not think there would have been any fun in it 
lord 
how i should like to be mankind before any of you and then i would chapter you about to all the balls 
dear me 
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forester 
dirty and me were to spend the day there and mrs forester promised to have a little dance in the evening 
by t e bye mrs faster and me are rusty friends 
and so she asked the two farrington to come but barrier was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself 
and then what do you think we did 
we dressed up chamberlayne in woman s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady 
only think what fun i not a soul knew of it but colonel and mrs faster and dirty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns 
and you cannut imagine how well he looked 
when penny and withal and pretty and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least 
lord 
how i laughed 
and so did mrs forester 
i thought should have died 
and but made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter 
with such kind of histories of their parties and good pride and prejudice 30 jokes did india assisted by littles tints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn 
elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham’s name 
their reception at home was most kind 
mrs bonnet rejoiced to see june in diminished beauty 
and more than once during dinner did mr bonnet say voluntarily to elizabeth 
i am glad you are come back dizzy their party in the dining-room was large for almost all the leaves came to meet marian and hear the news 
and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lucy was in hiring of marian across the table after the welfare an poultry of her eldest daughter 
mrs bonnet was doubly engaged 
on one hand collecting an account of the present fashion from jane who eat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger miss lenses 
and india in a voice rather louder than any other person was enervating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her 
a oh 
mary d said she d i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun 
as we went along kith and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach 
and i should have gone so all the way if city had not been sick 
and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsome for we treated the other three with the nicest co d luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too 
and then when we came away it was such fun 
i thought we never should have got into the coach 
l was ready to die of laughter 
and then we were so merry all the way home 
we talked and laughed so loud that anybody might have heard us ten miles of 
a 40 pride and prejudice 
to this mary very gravely replied a far be it from me my dear sister to deprecate such pleasures 
they would doubtless be congeal with the generality of female minds 
but i confess they would have no charms for me 
i should infinitely prefer a book 
but of this answer india heard not a word 
she seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all 
in the afternoon i. dial was urgent with the lest of the girls to walk to eton and see how everybody went on 
but elizabeth steadily applaud the scheme 
it should not be said that the miss bonnets could not be at home half a day before they were in unquiet of the officers 
there was another reason too or her opposition 
she dreaded seeing wicker again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible 
the comfort to lurk of the regiment s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression 
in a fortnight they were to go 
and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to argue her on his account 
he had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which india had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents 
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding 
but his answers were at the same time so vague and equinoctial that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last 
shouted 31 
elizabeth impatience to acquire jane with 
what had happened could no longer be overcome 
and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and pride and prejudice 
4 parting her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr dairy and herself 
miss bonnets astonishment was soon lessened by the strait easterly partiality which made any admiration of liza th appear perfectly natural 
and all sin-prize was shortly lost in other feelings 
she was sorry that mr darch should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them 
but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him 
a his being so sure of succeeding was wrong d said she and cecily ought not to have appeared 
but consider how much it must increase his disappointment 
b c indeed a replied elizabeth 
i am heartily sorry for him 
but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me 
you do not blame me however or refusing him in a blame you 
oh no 
a but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wick 
no 
i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did a but you evil know it when i have told you what happened the very next day 
he then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wicker 
what a stroke was this for poor jane 
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual 
nor was darch indication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery 
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other 
a this will not do said elizabeth 
b you never 421 pride and prejudice 
will be able to make both of them good for anything 
take our choice but you must be satisfied with on y one 
here is but such 3 quantity of merit between them 10 just enough to rule one good sort of man 
and of late it hill been shifting about prey much 
for my part i am inclined to believe it all r darch 
but you shall do as you chute.” it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane 
d i do not know when i have been more shocked d said she 
“wickhsm so very bad 
it is almost pest belief 
and poor mr darch 
dear dizzy only consider what he must have suffered 
such a disappointment and with the knowledge of our ill opinion tool and having to relate such a thing of his sister 
it is calmly too distressing 
i am sure you must feel it is 
oh 
no my regret and compassion are all done own by seeing you so full of both 
i know you will do lii such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent 
your mission makes me saving 
and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather 
poor william 
there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance 
such an openness and gentleness in his manner 
a there certainly was some great management in the education of those two young men 
one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it i never thought mr darch so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do 
and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason 
it is such a spur to one genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind 
one may be contrite and prejudice 421 finally abusive without saying anything just 
but one can not be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something withy 
izz when you first read that later i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now 
a indeed i could not 
i was uncomfortable enough 
i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy 
and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had 
oh 
how i wanted you i d a how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of william to mr dance for now they do appear wholly undeserved a certainty 
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural confuse fence of the prejudices i had been encouraging 
here is one point on which i want your advice 
i want to be told whether i eight or ought not to make our acquaintance in geneva understand wickham’s character 
a miss bonnet paused a little and then replied a surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully 
what is your own opinion 
2 that it ought not to be attempted 
mr darch has not authorities me to make his communication public 
on the contrary every particular relative to is sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself 
and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me 
the general service a not mr fancy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in hareton to attempt to place him in an amiable light 
i am not equal to it 
wicked will soon be gone 
and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is 
some time hence it will be all found out 
a then we may laugh at 
their stupidity in not 4d mim arm prejudice 
knowing it before 
at present i will say nothing about it 
you are quite right 
to have his errors rude public might ruin him for ever 
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re-establuh a character 
we must not make him desperation the tumult of eliulx'th’s mind was delayed by this conversation 
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in june whenever she might wish to talk again of either 
but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbid the disclosure 
she dared not relate the other half of mr dairy s letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend 
here was knowledge in which no one could partake 
and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of m story 
e and then said she d if that very improbable e event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bangle ma tell in a much more agreeable manner himself 
he liberty of communication can not be mine till it has lost all its value 
d she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sister s spirits 
jane was not happy 
she still cherished a very tender affection for hindley 
having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of rest attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than hira attachments often boast 
and so fervently did she value his rcmembmnee and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been curious to her own health and their tranquillity

4d a well dizzy d said mrs bonnet one day a what in your opinion now of this sad business of lanes 
for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody 
i told my defer pips on the other but i can not find out that jane saw anything of him in london 
well he is a very deserving young man 
and i do not suppose there in the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now 
there is no talk of his coming to tethered again in the manner 
and i have inquired of everybody too who is likely to know d i do not believe that he will ever live at tethered any more a oh well 
it ll as he chooses 
nobody wants him to come 
thou h i shall always say that he used my daughter extreme y ill 
and if i wan her i would not have put i with it 
well my comfort is i am cure jane will e of a broken heart 
and then he will be sorry for what he has done but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer 
well dizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and no the collapse live very comfortable do they 
well well i only hope it will last 
and what sort of table do they keep 
marlott is an excellent manager i dare say 
if she is half as sharp an her mother she is saving enough 
there in nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare nay a no nothing at all a great deal of good management depend upon it 
yes yes 
7th will take care not to outrun their income

well much good may it do them 
and so i suppose they often talk of having longboum when your father i dead 
they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happened 4d pride and prejudice 
a it was a subject which they could not mention before me no 
it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves 
well if they can be easy with an estate that is not awfully their own so much the better 
i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me chapter 31 
he first week of their return was soon one 
the second began 
it was the last of the regiments my at sherton and all the young ladies in the neighbours were drooping apace 
the dejection was almost universal

very frequently were the reproached for this insensibility by putty and liza whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family 
good heaven what is to become of us

how can you be smiling so lazy 
a their affectionate mother shared all their grief

her character will be red and the will at sixteen be the most determined dirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous 
— 
a dirty too in the worst and meant degree of irritation

and ill 
is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody 
at brighton the will be of less importance even as a common dirt than the has been here

d 150 pride and prejudicial 
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content 
but her own opinion continued the some and the left him disappointed and sorry 
it was not in her nature however to increase her vexation by dwelling on them 
she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augmented them by anxiety 
was no part of her disposition 
hind india and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united visibility 
in dials imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness 
she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that guy bathingplace covered with officers 
she saw herself the object or attention to tens and to scream of them at present unknown 
she taw all the glories of the camp 
its tent 2 stretched forth in beauteous infirmity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet 
and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six occurs at once 
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from each prospects and web realities as these what would have been her sensations 
they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same 
ladies going to brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself 
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed 
and their rapture continued with little intermission to the very day of ladies leaving home 
elizabeth was now to see r wicked for the last time 
huvingbeen frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over 
the agitation of former partiality entirely so 
she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted pride and prejudice 
so her an affectation and a nameless to disgust and weary 
in his present behaviour to herself moreover the had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon received of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their so maintenance could only serve after what had time pa to provoke her 
he lost all concern for him in sending reef thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry 
and while she steadied repressed it could not but eel the roof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any name by their renewal 
on the very last day of the regiment s remaining at person he dined with others of the faces at longbourn 
and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time h at hereford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam’s and mr days having both spent three weeks at musings and asked him if he was acquainted with the former 
he looked surprised i pleased alarmed 
but with a moment recollection and 
returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often 
and after observing that he was a very gentlemanly man asked her how she had liked him 
her answer was wanting in his favour 
with an air of indifferent he soon afterwards added 
a how long did you say that he was at roarings

if elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a blight inclination of the head 
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him 
the rest of the evening passed with the nectarwt on his side of usual cheerfulness but w further attempt to distinguish elizabeth 
and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again 
when the party broke up india returned with mrs f crater to mention from whence they were to let out early the next morning 
the ration between her and her family wan rather noisy n pathetic 
city was the only one who shed tears 
but she did weep from vexation and envy 
mrs bonnet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that the would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible 
— advice which there was every reason to believe would he attended to 
and in the clamorous happiness of india herself in bidding farewell the more gentle radius of her sisters were uttered without being heard 
silent i133ad elizabeth opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of congeal felicity or domestic comfort 
her father captivate by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illegal mind had very early in their put an end to all real nﬁ‘eetion for her

talents which rightly used muh lit least have preserved the mapcctability of his daughter even if incapable of enlarging the mind of hit wife 
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham’c departure the found little other cause for satisfaction in the hm of the regiment 
their parting abroad were let varied than before and at home she had a mother and lines where comment repinings at the dull of everything around them threw a real gloom over their plans and prejudice 
as domestic circle 
and though city might in time in her natural degree of sense since the distress of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and d a camp 
upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking ace bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself 
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity 
to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment 
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thou hats 
it was her best consolation for all the unstable hours which the discontent of her mother and fifty made inevitable 
and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect 
but it is fortunate d thought she 2 that i have something to wish for 
were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain 
but here my carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised 
a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful 
and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation 
when india went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and fifty 
but her letters were always long expected and always very short 
those to her mother contained little else than 26s pride and prejudice 
that the were returned from the library where such on such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild 
that she had i new gown or a new l which she would have described more full was obliged to leave i 
in n violent hurry as is forever called her and they were going to the camp 
and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to he leant 
for her letters to fifty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the word 
to be made public 
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerful begun to appear at longboum 
everything wore a happier cat 
the families who had been in town for the water came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose 
mrs bonnet was restored to her usual querulous serenity 
and by the middle of june city was so much recovered as to be able to enter mention without tears 
an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerant reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should be quarters in hareton 
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight het only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from n garden which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent 
mr gardener would be prevented b business from setting out till a fortnight later in june y and must be in london again within a month 
and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see to much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted pride and prejudice 
7 tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than berkshire 
in that cow there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks 
and to my garden it had a peculiarly strong attraction 
the town where he had formerly pane some can of her life and where they were now to spend a cows do a was probably as great an object of her curiosity as l the celebrated beauties of matlock chauworth overtake or the peak 
elizabeth was excessively disappointed 
she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough 
but it was her business to be satiated 
and certainly her temper to be happy 
and all was soon right again with the mention of derby-hire there were many ideas connected 
it was in be for her to see the word without thinking of marley and its owner 
but surely d said she d i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified aparwithout hit perceiving me the period of expectation was now doubled 
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt arrival 
but they did pass away and mr and my garden with their four children did at length appear at longbourn 
the children two girl of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the cellar care of their cousin jane who was the gentle favourite and who already come and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way 
teaching them playing with them and loving them 
the garden prayed only one i hot at longbourn and set off the next morning with e both in purity of novelty and amusement

it is not the object of this work to give a dozen iron of devonshire nor of any of the remarkable see through which their route thither lay 
oxford leathern wick pennyworth tringham c are sufficiently known 
a small part of devonshire is all the present concern 
to the little town of ambition the scene of mrs gardener s former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the count 
and within five mulch of norton elizabeth found room her aunt that ll -mbcrlcy was situated 
it was not in their direct roll nor more than a mile or two out of it 
in talking over their route the evening before mrs gardener expressed an inclination to see the place again 
mr gardener declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation 
my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much 
a said her aunt 
a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected 
wicked passed all his youth there you know elizabeth was distressed 
she felt that she had no business at temperly and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it 
she must own that she was tired of great houses 
after going over so many she really had no pleasure in one carpet or satin curtains 
s garden abused her stupidity 
d if it were merely a one house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself 
but the grounds are delightful 
they have some of the nest woods in the country 
elizabeth said no more 
but her mind could not pride and prejudice 
9 acquiesce 
the possibility of meeting mr darch while viewing the place instantly occurred 
it would he dreadful 
she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk 
but against this there were objection 
and the rally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private inquiries us to the absence of the family were unfavourable answered 
according 10 when she retired at night she asked the chamber whether temperly were not a ve line place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer 
a most welcome negative followed the last question 
and her arms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself 
and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a pair er air of indifference that she had not really any dislike e to the scheme 
— to temperly therefore they were to go 
10th 31 
elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of temperly woods with some perturbation 
and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high butter 
the park was very large and contained great variety of ground 
they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent 
elizabeth mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point so pride and prejudicial 
of view 
they gradually ascended for inlf-a-mile and then found themselves at the top of a ooon'derable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by temperly home filth on the opposite side of a valley into which the mad with tome abrupt taen wound 
it wan a large handsome atone built long standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of hi in woody hills 
and in front a stream of some natural in rtancewaa swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance 
it 
bankers neither formal nor falsely adorned 
elizabeth was delighted 
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been to little counter-acted by an awkward taste 
they were all of them warm in their admiration 
and at that moment the felt that to be mine of temperly wi t be something 
they descended the hill created the bridge and drove to the door 
and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehension of meeting in owner returned 
she dreaded lest the chamber maid had been mistaken 
on applying to see the lace they were admitted into the hall 
and elizabeth m they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was 
the housekeeper came 
a respectable-looking elderly woman much lean one and more civil than the had any notion of india her 
they followed her into the dining-parlour 
it was a large well-proportioned room handsomely fitted up 
elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect 
the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptneas from the distance was a beautiful object 
every disposition of the ground was good 
an she looked on the whole scene the river the tree 
mattered on it banks and pride and prejudicial 
6d 
the winding of the valley is for as she could trace it with delight 
as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions 
but from every window there were beauties to be seen 
the rooms were lofty and handsome end their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor useless line 
with less of s labour and more real elegance than the furniture of losing 
and of dili‘jlice thought she d i might have been inn with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted 
instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and sunk 
but no 
— recollecting herself 
that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me 
i should not have been allowed to invite them 
this was a lucky recollection 
it saved her from something like regret 
she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent but had not courage for it 
at length however the question was asked by her uncle 
and she turned away with alarm while mrs records replied that he was adding a but we expect helen to-morrow with a large ay of friends how re iced was elizabeth that r own journey had not y any circumstance been delayed a day l her aunt now called her to look at a picture 
she approached and saw the likeness of mr wigwam suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantel ice 
her aunt asked her willingly how she liked it the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the curve of a young gentleman the son of her late master s seaward who had been brought up by him at his own expense 
he is now gone into 2 the army she added 
but i am afraid he has turned out ve wild mrs garden looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not mum it 
and that said my records pointing to another of the miniatures 2 is my master 
and we like him 
it was drawn at the same time as the o r 
about eight years ago 
d i have heard much of your master s line laid mrs gardener looking at the picture 
it in a handsome face 
but izzy you can tell us whether it is like or not 
mrs reynold’s respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master 
a does that young lady know mr darch 
a elizabeth co cured and laid 
d a little and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman 
marian 10 2 yes very handsome i am sure i know none so handsome 
but in the gallery upstairs you will see a sneer larger picture of him than this 
this room was my late master favourite room and these miniatures are just as they lured to be then 
he was very fond of them 
this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham’l being among them 
is records then directed their attention to one of miss darch drawn when she was only eight years old 
e and it miss darch said mr gardener 
oh 
yes 
the handsomest young lady that ever was seen 
and so accomplished l 
she plays and sings all day long 
in the next room is a new instrument just come own for her 
a present from my master 
she comes hen to-morrow with him 
pride and prejudicial 
as handsome as her brother 2 i in ruins mao prejudice 
by mr gardener whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicative by his questions and remarks mrs records either from pride and-attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister 
2 is your master much at temperly in the course of the year i 
not so much as i could wish sir 
but i dare say he may spend turf his time here 
and miss dairy s always down for the summer months 
except thought elizabeth when she goes to ksmsgnte.” d if your master would marry you might see more of him 
yes sir 
but i do not know when time will be 
i do not know who is good enough for him 
mr and mrs gardener smiled 
elizabeth could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that ou should think so d say no more than the truth and what everyone will say that knows him replied the other 
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far 
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added 
i have never had a cross word from him in my life apply have known him ever since he was four years of 
a this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas 
that he was not a goodtempeted man had been her rest opinion 
her keenest attention was awakened 3 she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying 
a there are very few plea of whom so much can be said 
you are lucky in having such a master 
a yes sir i know i am 
if were to go through the world i could not meet with a better 
but i have always observed that they who are good-natured 6d mum and prejudice 
when children are good-natured when they grow up 
and he was always the sweet-tempered most generoushurted boy in the world a elizabeth almost stared at her 
can this be mr dare i thought she 
2 is father was an excellent man said mrs gardener 
yes madam that he was indeed 
and his son will be just like him 
just as amiable to the poor 
elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more 
mrs records could interest her on no other point 
she related the subjects of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain 
mr gardener highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject 
and she dwelt with energy on his many merits no they proceeded together up the great staircase 
a he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived 
not like the wild young men nowadays who think of nothing but themselves 
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name 
some people call him proud 
but i am sure i never saw anything of it 
to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men 
a in what an amiable light does this place him be thou het elizabeth 
a his one account of him whispered her aunt as they walked 2 is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend 
a perhaps we might be received that is not very likely 
our authority was too good 
on reaching the spacious lobby above they were rare and prejudice 
be shown into a very pretty sitting-room lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below 
and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darch who had taken a liking to the room when last at temperly 
he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards s one of the windows 
mrs records anticipated miss darch delight when she should enter the room 
e and this is always the way with him a she added 
whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment 
there is nothing he would not do for her 
the picture-gallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms were all that remained to be shown 
in the former were many good paintings 
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss dairy s in canons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible 
in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to ix the attention of a stranger 
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her 
at last it arrested her 
and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr dry with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her 
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery 
mrs records informed them that it had been taken in his father's lifetime 
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeth mind a more gentle section towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance

6d passion of surprised on beholding his master must immediately have told it 
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family 
amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment 
and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life 
nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual lateness 
and he ate his inquiries us to the time of her having leftﬁngboum and of her stay in berkshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts 
at length every idea seemed to fail him 
and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave 
the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure 
but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence 
she was overpowered by shame and vexation 
her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill-judged thing in the world 
how strange must it appear to him 
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man 
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again or 
why if the come 
or why did he thus come a day before he was expected 
had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination 
for it was plain that he was that moment arrived 
that moment ali hated from his horse or his carriage 
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the by pride and prejudicial 
meeting 
and his behaviour so strongly altered 
what could it mean 
that he should even speak to her was amazing l 
but to speak with such civility to inquire after her family never in her life had she seen his manners so lit e dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting 
what a contrast did it over to his last address in rousing park when he ut his letter into her hand 
she knew not what to think or how to account for it 
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler all of ground or a line reach of the woods to which they were approaching 
but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it 
and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they mounted out she distinguished no part of the scene 
er thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of temperly house whichever it might be where mr darch then was 
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind 
in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everything she was still dear to him 
perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease 
yet there had been bat in his voice which was not like ease 
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure 
at length however the remarks of her corn onions on her absence of mind roused her and she exalt the necessity of appearing more like herself 
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds 
whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of pride and prejudice 
6d woods overspreading many and occasional part of the stream 
mr gardener expressed a wish m going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk 
with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round 
it settled the matter 
and they pursued the accustomed circuit 
which brought them in after some time in a descent among hanging w to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts 
they crossed it b a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene 
it was s t less adorned than any they had yet visited 
and t e valley here contracted into a gun allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it 
elizabeth longed to explore its windings 
but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs gardeners who was not a great walked could go no farther and thought one of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible 
er niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction 
but their progress was slow for mr gardener though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of washing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little 
whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darch approaching them and at no great distance 
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met 
elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them 
for a few moments indeed she felt that he would prove pride and pitejumcis‘ 
half strike into some other path 
the idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view 
the turn past he was immediately before them 
with a g once she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility 
and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place 
but she had not got beyond the we s dell hateful and charming a when some unlucky recollection obtruded and she fancied that praise of temperly from her might be mischievously construed 
her colour changed and she said no more 
mrs garden was standing at little behind 
and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends 
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unrepaired 
and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his o er to herself 
what will be his surprise d thought she d when he knows who they are 
he takes them now for plea of fashion 
l he introduction however was immediately made 
and as e named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his camping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions 
that he was mrs-2:1 
by the conception was evident 
he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr gardener 
elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph 
it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush 
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners 
pride and prejudice 
7th the conversation soon turned upon dashing 
and she heard mr darch invite him with the greatest civility to she there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport 
mrs gardeners who was walking arm-in-arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder 
elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly 
the compliment must be all for herself 
her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating 2 why is he so altered 
from what can it proceed 
it can not be for rue 
it can not be for my sake that his manners are thus softened 
my re roofs at hereford could not work such a change as this 
it is impossible that he should still love me after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their elms after descending to the brink of the river for the letter inspection of some curious water-plug there chanced to be a little alteration 
it originated in mrs gardeners who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeth arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husband s 
mr darch took her place by her niece and they walked on together 
after a short silence the lady 31st spoke 
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected 
— a for your housekeeper a she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow 
and indeed before we left farewell we understood that on were not immediately expected in the country 
he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his rewards had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he 120 pride and prejudicial

she immediately felt that whatever desire mill fancy might have of being acquainted with her mum he the work of her brother and without looking further it will uni-factory 
it was gratifying to know that till sentiment him not made him think really ill of her 
they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought 
iilimhcth was not comfortable 
that was iquoiiilxlei lit the was chattered and pleased 
hit walls of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind 
they noon outstripped the other and when they hand reached the carriage mr and mrs garden were half quarter of a mile behind 
he then melted her to wall into the house 
hut the decline herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn 
at inch 2 time much might have been said and silence was very awkward 
she wanted to talk but there wearied an embark on every subject 
at last the recollect that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and overrule with great perseverpride and prejudice 
7th once 
yet time and her aunt moved slowly 
and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the lite-54m was over 
on mr and mrs gardener s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment 
but this was declined and they m on each side with the utmost politeness 
mr arc handed the ladies into the carriage 
and when it drove of elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house 
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began 
and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to an thing they had expected 
he is perfect 
well behaved polite and unassuming d said her uncle e 
there it something a little merely in him to be sure a replied her aunt 
a but it is confined to his air and is not becoming 
i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing often i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us 
it was more than civil 
it was really attentive 
and there was no necessity for such attention 
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very triﬂing.” to be sure dizzy d said her aunt he is not so handsome as wicker 
or rather he has not wickham’s countenance for his features are perfectly good 
but how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable 
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning 
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities 2 replied her uncle 
you great men often are 
and therefore i shall not take him at his word about asking as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds 
4 pride and prejudice 
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing 
d from what we have seen of him a continued my garden i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wicker 
he has not an ill-natured fooit 
on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks 
and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an un admirable idea of his heart 
but to be sure the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most gaming character 
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes 
but he is a liberal master i suppose 
and liza 
in the eye of servant comprehends every virtue 
elizabeth here felt herself called on to my something in ventilation of his behaviour to wicked 
and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction 
and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham’s so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire 
in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the peculiar transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on 
mrs garden was surprised and concerned 
but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection 
and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else 
fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they had no sooner dined than she set all again in quest of her former a distance and the evening was spent in the satisfaction of an intercourse renewed after many years continuance 
while ann szjuoicn 
7th the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for an of these new friends 
and she could do nothing but t ink and think with wonder of mr dairy s civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister 
chapter 117 
elizabeth had settled it that mr darch could bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching temperly 
and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning 
but her conclusion was false 
for on the very morning after their own arrival at ambition these visitors came 
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage e drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curriclc driving up the street 
elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by a painting them with the honour which she expected 
er uncle and aunt were all amazement 
and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business 
nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece 
while these new-born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeth feelings was every moment increasing

77 with which he expressed himself on seeing her again 
he inquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked an spoke with the same good-humour ease that he had ever done 
to mr and mrs gardener he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself 
they had long wished to see him 
the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention 
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr dairy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquire 
and they soon drew from those inquiries the ful conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love 
of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt 
but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough 
elizabeth on her side had much to do 
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors 
she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all 
and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were possessed in her favour 
hindley was ready georgian was eager and dry determined to be pleased 
in seeing hindley her thoughts naturally new to her sister 
and oh 
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner 
sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance 
but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darch who had been set up as a rival to jane 
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard 
nothing occurred beef pride and prejudice 
weena them that could justify the hope his sister 
on this point the was soon satisfied 
and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted in recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared 
he observed to her at it moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing hen and before she could reply he added 
it ll have eight months 
we have not me 
since the 14th of november when we were all dancing together at tethered 
elizabeth was pleased to and his memory so exact 
and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when attended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at leghorn 
there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark 
but there was a look and it manner which gave them meaning 
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darch himself 
but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaining and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hatter or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlive one day 
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace 
when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdain and collected their last lively scene in uniform parsonage 
the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she pride and prejudice 
7th could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible 
never even in the company of his dear friends at tethered or his dignity relations at roarings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self-consequence or bending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and centre of the ladies both of tethered and rousing 
their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour 
and when they arose to depart mr dairy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardeners and miss bonnet to dinner at temperly before they left the country 
miss dearly though with a residence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed 
mrs garden looked at her niece desirous of knowing how 26 whom the invitation most concerned felt die as to its acceptance hut elizabeth had turned away her head 
presuming however that this studied avoidance kex rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond o society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on 
hindley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many inquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends 
elizabeth constructing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased 
and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little 
eager to be alone and fearful of inquiries box pride am prejudice 
or hint from her uncle and aunt she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of hindley and then hurried away to dress 
but the had no reason to fear mr and my gardener curiosity 
it wan not their wish to force her communication 
it wan evident that she wan much better acquainted with mr darch than they had before any idea of 
it wan evident that he wan very much in love with her 
they saw much to interest but nothing to justify inquiries 
o mr mercy it wan now a matter of next to think well 
and as for at their acquaintance read there was no fault to and 
they could not be touched by his politeness 
and had they drawn hell character from their own feelings and ill 
servants report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for mr darch 
there wine now an interest however in believing the housekeeper 
and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whole own manner indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected 
neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their ambition friends that could materially lessen its weight 
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride 
pride he roughly had and if not it would certainly be imparted by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit 
it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the r 
with respect to william the traveller soon found that he was not held there in much estimating 
for though the chief of his concert with the son of his patron were perfectly understood it was yet a well-known fact that on his quitting berkshire he had pride and prejudicial 31 felt many debts behind him which mr darch afterwards discharge ed 
as for eateth her thoughts were at temperly this evening more than the last 
and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards an in that mansion 
and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out 
she certainly did not hate him 
no 
hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called 
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to he repugnant to her feelings 
and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendly nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable alight which yesterday had produced 
but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked 
it was gratitude 
— gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and harmony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanied in her dejection 
he who she had been peru ed would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves on were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister 
such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude 
for to love ardent love it must be attributed 
and as such in impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though could u. r 82 moss and prejudicial 
not be exact

and the only wanted to know how far the wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that the should employ the wer which her fancy told her the nil o bringing on the renewal of hit nddreuel 
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility 3

and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at temperly the following morning 
they were therefore to go elizabeth war pleaded 
though when the allied herself the reason the had very little to say in reply 
mr gardener left them soon after brcnkfnat 
the thing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at temperly by noon 
chapter 117 
winced as elizabeth now was that mice bingley’e dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at temperly must be to her and wan curious to know with how much civility on that lady ride the acquaintance would now be renewed 
on reaching the house they were shown through the hall into the spoon whose norther aspect rendered it delighted for summer

83 ground admitted a most refreshing view of the hi h wood hills behind the house and of the beautiful pa s and punish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn 
in this room they were received by main darch who was sitting there with mrs burst and miss hindley and the lady with whom she lived in london 
georgian reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding lion shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved mrs gardeners and her niece however did her rustic and pitied her 
by mrs burst and miss hindley they were noticed only by a courtesy 
and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments 
it was first broken b mrs ancestry a genteel agreeable-looking woman w use endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-read than either of the others 
and between her and mrs garden with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on 
miss darch looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it 
and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard 
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss hindley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss dry without calling her attention 
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenience distance 
but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much 
her own droughts were em losing her 
he ax cited every moment that some of the gentlemen would d enter the room 
she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them 
and whether she wished 84 pride and hemmed 
or feared it most she could scarcely determine 
met sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss hindley's voice elizabeth was round b re 
ceiling from her a cold inquiry after the health other family 
she answered with equal indifference and gravity and the other said no more 
the next vocation which their visits afforded was producer by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the fact fruits in season 
but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annexed to mist dairy had been given to remind her of her post 
there was now employment for the whole party 
for though they could not a i talk they could all eat 
and the beautiful pyramids of green doctrines and preaches soon collected them round the table 
while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether the most famed or wished for the appearance of mr dry by the feelings which prevail on iii entering the room 
and then though but a moment before ll had believed her wishes to predominates she began to regret that he came 
he led been some time with mr gardeners who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgian that morning 
no sooner did he appear than elizabeth writer resolved to be perfectly easy and embarrassed 
— o resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicion 
of the whole party were awakened against them and that their was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room 
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked at in miss bingley’a in spite of the smilewhich overspread her face whenever she spoke to one pride and prejudice 
85 of its objects 
for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr dairy were by no means over 
miss darch on her brothers entrance exerted herself much more to talk 
and elizabeth law that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and fonvnrdcd as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side 
miss hindley saw this likewise 
and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of laying with sneering civility

in days presence she dared not mention william s name 
but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts 
and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment distress 
but exerting herself vigorously to repeat the ill-natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone 
while she spoke an involuntary glance showed her dry with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes 
had miss bangle known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubted would have refrained from the hint 
but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in days opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that no i 
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss arches meditated elopement 
into no creature had it been revealed where secret was possible except to elizabeth 
and from 31 hindley's connection her brother was particularly 8d pride and prejudice 
anxious to conceal it from that very with which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own 
he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should effect a his endeavour to separate him from miss bent it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend 
elizabeth collected behaviour however soon suited his emotion 
and as miss hindley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wicked georgian also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more 
her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully 
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned 
and while mr dairy was attending them to their carriage miss hindley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth person behaviour and dress 
but georgian would not join her 
her brothers commendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not ever and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgian without the wer of wending her otherwise than lovely and amiable i when fancy returned to the spoon miss hindley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister 
how very ill liza bonnet looks this morning mr dairy she cried 
i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter 
she is grown so brown and coarse 
louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again 
however little mr fancy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather mum and majumcrt 87 fanned 
no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer 
a f or my own part 4 the rejoined d i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her 
her face is too thin 
her complexion has no brilliancy 
and her features are not at all handsome 
her nose wants character 
there is nothing marked in its lines 
her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way 
and as for her eyes which have sometimes been calm ed so one i never could perceive anything extraordinary in them 
they have a sharp sheepish look which i do not like at all 
and in her air altogether there is s self-sufﬁciency without fashion which is intolerable 2 persuaded as miss hindley was that dared admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself 
but any people are not always wise 
and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected 
he was resolutely silent however 
and from a determination of making him speak the continued 
i remember when we rest met her in hertfordshire how amang we all were to and that she was a repute beauty 
and i particularly recollect your say no one night after they had been dining at nethcrﬁyelld e s a beauty 
i should as soon call her mother a with but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time a yes 2 replied darch who could contain himself no longer about that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance 
he then went awn and miss hindley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself 
my garden and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except 88 nun and summer 
what had particularly interested them both 
the look and behaviour of everybody they had been were dip ensued except of the person who had natty engaged their attention 
they talked of hi 
either hit friendly his house his fruit everything but himself 
yet elizabeth war longing to know what my garden thou hat of him and n gardener would have been high gratified by her recede beginning the chapter 117 
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not lending a letter from lane on their link arrival at ambition 
and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the morning that had now been spent there 
but on the thing her repinings war over and her sister sustained by the receipt of two letter from her at once on one of which w marked that it had been missed elsewhere 
elizabeth want surprised at it at jane had written the direction remarkably ill 
they had just been p sang to walk an the letter 
came in 
and her uncle an aunt leaving her to enjoy them in view set off by themselves 
the one moment must be rat attended to 
it had been written eve day ago 
the beginning contained an account of all their little partner and engagements with such new at the country afforded 
but the latter half which was dated 3 day after and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence 
it war to this erect a b since writing the above dearest dizzy something hill occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature 
but am afraid of answering you 
be assured that we are all well 
what i have to lay relates to poor ii pride and prejudicial 89 india 
an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forester to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his offers 
to own the truth with michael imagine our surprise 
to little however it does not seem so wholly unexpected 
am v very sorry 
so imprint a match on both sides 
at i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood 
thoughtless and indiscreetly i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart 
his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can ve her nothing 
our poor mother is sadly grieved 
nelly father bears it better 
how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him 
we must forget it ourselves 
they were of saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight 
the express was sent of directly 
my dear izz they must have passed within ten miles of us 
colonel forester gives us reason to expect him here soon 
ladies left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention 
i must conclude for i can not be long from my poor mother 
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on banishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first 
by this time my dearest sister you have mind my hurried letter 
i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i can not answer for being incoherent 
90 pride and prejudice dearest dizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have had new for you and it can not be delayed 
impotent up a marriage between mr winking and our poor ladies would be we are now anxious to be altered it am taken place for there ll but too mud deuce to far they are not gone to scotland 
colonel fonder came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hour 
after the pretty 
though lydiu’t than letter to mr f gave them to understand that they were going to greet green something was dropped by fanny expressing lull belief that w. never intended to go there or to marry india at all which we repented to colonel for who instantly taking the alarm net on from it intending to trace their route 
lie till trace them civilly to clnphnm but no further 
for on entering that place they removed into a hackneycouch and llitmiuexl the crick that brought them from lip 
all that ll known after thin ll that they ware ten to continue the london road 
ll know not what to think 
after making eve be in i on that little london colonel f mill lkhulna idle ordained anxiously renewing them at all the turnpike and at the inn in flame and hatred but without any succour 
no such people had been seen to put through 
with the kindest concern he came on to longboum and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner root creditable to his heart 
i am sincerely grieved for him and my fly but no one can throw any blame on them 
our tliutrcu m dear izz is very great 
my father and mother believe the worst but i can not think no ill of him 
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their link plan 
and even if l could form we a design again a young woman of lydia’a connection which ll not likely can i supposed her to look to everything 
impossible i grieve to and pride and prejudicial

ever that colonel far is not disposed to depend upon drum marriage 
he shook his head when i expressed my h s and said he feared w. was not a man to be true m poor mother is really ill and keeps her room 
co d she exert herself it would be better 
but this is not to be expected 
and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected 
poor ditty has anger for having concealed their attachment 
but as it was a matter of conscience one can not wonder 
i am truly glad dearest dizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes 
but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return 
i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenience 
adieu 
i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not 
but circumstances are such that i can not help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible 
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it thou h i have still something more to ask of the former 
y father is going to london with colonel forester instantly to try to discover her 
what he means to do i am sure i know not 
but his excessive 
distress will not allow him to music any measure in the best and safest way an colonel forester is obliged to be at brighton again to-morrow evening 
in such an existence my uncle advice and assistance would be everything in the world 
he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his g nests 
a oh 
where where is my uncle 
cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the me so precious 
but as she reached the door it was opened y a servant and mr darch appeared 
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start 
2 pride and prejudice 
and before he could recover himself enough to speak she in whose'miud every idea was superseded by dials situation hastily exclaimed 2 10 your pardon but i must leave you 
i must and r garden this moment on business that can not be delayed 
i have not an instant to lose good god i what is the matter 
a cried he with more feeling than politeness 
then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute 
but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardener 
you are not well enough a 
you can not go yourself a elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her after thing to pursue them 
calling back the servant there are she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly 
on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for dared to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiserate d let me call your maid 
is there nothing you could take to give you present relief 
— a glass of wine 
— shall i get you one 
— you are very ill no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself 
there is nothing the matter with me 
i am quite well 
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn 
she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word 
fancy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in comes 
passionate silence 
at length she spoke again 
i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news 
it can not be concealed from any one 
my pride and prejudicial 
3 youngest sister has left all her friends 
has dropped 
— lem thrown herself into the power of 
of mr wicker 
they are gone i 
together from brighton 
ton know lam too well to doubt the rest 
she has no money no connection nothing that can tempt him to 
she is lost for ever dairy was fixed in astonishing a when i consider a she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it 
i who knew what he was 
had i but explained some part of it only 
some part of what i learnt to my own family 
had his character been known this could not have happened 
but it is all 
all too late now a i am grieved indeed a cried darch 
agreed 
hooked 
but is it certain 
absolutely certain 
a oh yet 
they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certain not gone to scotland 
e and what has been one what has been attempted to recover her 
r 2 my father is gone to london 
and jane has written to beg my uncle immediate assistance 
and we shall be off i hope in half-an-hour 
but nothing can be done 
i know very well that nothing can be done 
how is such n man to be worked on 
how are they even to be discovered 
i have not the smaller hope 
it is every way horrible 
fancy shook his head in silent acquiescence 
when my eyes were opened to his real character 
— oh 
had i known what i ought what i dared to do 
but i knew not 
i was afraid of doing too much 
wretched wretched mistake 
a diary made no answer 
he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy 
elizabeth soon cheered and instantly underwood it 
h 
4 pride and prejudice 
her power was sinking 
everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace 
she could neither wonder not condemn but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolstory to her bosom accorded no ration of her distress 
it was on the contrary exact y calculated to make her understand her own wishes 
and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must he vain 
but self though it would intrude could not across her 
ladies 
the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care 
and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to everything else 
and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i anything to plead in excuse of m stay but real though unavailing concern 
would to even that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress 
— but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely so ask for your thanks 
this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at temperly to-day 
oh yes 
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darch 
say that urgent business calls us home immediately 
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible 
i know it can not be long 
he remain assured her of his secrecy 
again expressed 
his sorrow for distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his cow ligaments for her relations with only one serious parting oak went away 
as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how impropriety sun rozums 
as table it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in berkshire 
and as she threw a introspective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradiction and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have noted in continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination 
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeth change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty 
but if otherwise 
if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged 
nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wicket and that its ill success might perhaps authorities her to seek the other less interesting mode attachment 
be that as it may the saw him go with regret 
and in this early exact leg of what dials infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business 
never since reading james second letter had she entertained a hope of wickham’s meaning to marry her 
no one but jane she thought could fatter herself with such an expectation 
surprise was the least of her feeling s on this develop meant 
while the contents of the first letter remain on her mind she was all s rule 
all astonishment that wicked should marry a girl whom it was in table he could marry for money 
and how india could ever have attached him had a peaked incomprehensible 
but now it was all too nature 
for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms 
and though she did not suppose liar to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that go pride and prejudice 
neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey 
she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that indian had any partiality for him 
but she was convinced that l did had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody 
sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite in their attentions raised them in her opinion 
her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object 
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl 
oh 
how acutely did she now feel it 
she was wild to be at home 
to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance 
and though almost 
persuaded that nothing could be done for indian her uncle interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe 
mr and mrs gardener had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly ill 
— 
hut satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the outstript of the last with trembling energy 
though india had never been a favourite with them mr and mrs gardener could not but be deeply affected 
not india only but all were concerned in it 
and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr gardener readily promised every assistance in his power 
elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude 
and all three being actuated by one spirit everything relating to their journey was speedily settled 
they were to be of as soon as possible 
a but what is to be done about temperly 
a cried prudence and snow 
9th 
mrs gardener 
a john told us mr dairy was here when ou sent for us 
— 
was it so 10 
e s 
and i told him we should not be able to keep our en agreement 
the 
is all settled 
a hat is all settled 
a repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare 
and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth 
oh that i knew how it was 
a but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour 
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that 
all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself 
but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at linton with false excuses for their sudden departure 
an hour however saw the whole completed 
and mr gardener meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be one but to go 
and a elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longboum 
chapter 117 d have been thinking it over again elizabeth a said her uncle as they drove from the town 
and really a n serious consideration i am much more inclined than was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter 
it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best 
could he expect ll 
6d 9 pride and prejudice 
that her friends would not step forward 
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forester 
his temptation is not adequate to the risk 
d a do you really think so 
cried elizabeth brightening us for a moment 
a pon my word d said mrs garden i begin to be of your uncle opinion 
it is really too great a visitation of secrecy honour and interest for him to be guilty of it 
i can not think so very ill of wick 
on you yourself izz so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it p d a not perhaps of neglecting his own interest 
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable 
if indeed it should be so 
but i dare not hope it 
why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case i 
a in the first place a replied mr garden where is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland oh 
but their removing from the chaise into an hacked coach is such a presumption 
and besides no traces of them were to be found on the branch road well then 
supposing them to be in london 
they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptional purpose 
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side 
and it might strike them that they could be more economical though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland but wh all this secrecy 
why any fear of deduction 
they must their marriage be private 
oh no no 
this is not likely 
his most particular friend you see by james account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her 
wicked will never marry a price and prejudice 
9th woman without some money 
he can not afford it 
and what claims has india 
what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake fore of every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well p as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the co might throw on s dishonourable elopement with her am not able to judge 
for 10 know nothing of the effect that such a step might produce 
but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good 
ladies has no brothers to forward 
and he might imagine from my father's be favour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that be would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such 17 matter 
a but can you think that india is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other term than marriage 
it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes 2 that s sisters sense of decay and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt 
but really i know not what to say 
perhaps i am not doing her justice 
but she is very young 
she has never been taught to think on serious subjects 
and for the last half-hour 
nay for a twelvemonth 
she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity 
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way 
since the 
— 
— hire were 31st chartered in merit nothing but love irritation and orders have been in her head 
she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater 
what shall i call it 
susceptibility to her feelings 
which are naturally lively enough 
and we all know that wicked pride and judge ham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman 2 but you see that jane 2 laid her aunt does not think so ill of wicker as to believe him capable of the attempt a of whom does jane ever think ill 
and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against which but jane knows as well up i do what wicker really is 
we both know that he has been private in every sense of the word 
that he has neither integrity nor honour 
that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating and do you really know all this 
cried mrs gardener whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive 
i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring 
i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr darch 
and you yourself when last at leghorn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him 
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty 
which it is not worth while to relate 
but his lies about the whole hatherley family are endless 
from what he said of miss fancy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl 
at he knew to the contrary himself 
he must know that she was as amiable and pretending as we have found her but does ladies know nothing of this 
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand 3 2 oh yes 
that that is the worst of all 
till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr dairy and his relation colonel fitzwilliarn i was ignorant of the truth myself 
and when i returned home the pride and prejudice 
1801 
— 
— hire was to leave sexton in a week or fortnight's time 
as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public 
for of what use could it apparently be to an one that the good of iron which all the neighbourhood had of him should t en be overthrow 
and even when it was settled that indian should go with mrs faster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me 
that a could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head 
that such a consequence as in should ensue on may easily believe was far enough from my things take a when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other i d a not the slightest 
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side 
and had anything of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that our in not a family on which it could be thrown away 
when link he entered the corpse she was ready enough to admire him 
but so we all were 
every girl in or near norton was out of her senses about him for the first two months 
but he never distinguished iver by any particular attention 
and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiments who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey 
from elizabeth thoughts it was never absent 
fixed there by the 1802 pride and bigger 
keenest of all anguish self-reproach she could and no interment of ale or forgetfulness 
they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner-time the next day 
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied long ax tidal 
lathe littmardineu attracted by the light of a chaise were standing on the step 
of the house as they entered the peacock 
and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that li hunted up their faces and displayed itself over their who e bodies in a variety of tapers and risks was the first pleasing meet of their welcome 
elizabeth jumped out 
and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running downstairs from her mother apartment immediately met her 
elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives 
d a not yet replied jane 
a but now that my dear uncle is come i hope everything will be well 
2 is my father in town p 
yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you wonder c and have you heard from him often 
2 we have heard only once 
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do 
he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of import lance to mention 
4 1/2 my mother 
how is she 
how are you all 
a my mother is tolerably well i trust 
though her spirits are greatly shaken 
she is upstairs and will pride and prejudice 
1801 have greet satisfaction in seeing on all 
she doe 
not yet leave her dressing-room 
try and fifty thank heaven are quite well a but you 
how are you i 
cried elizabeth 
b you look pale 
how much you must have gone through 
her sister however matured her of her being perfectly well 
and their conversation which had been no while mr and my garden were engaged wi their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party 
jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and ducked them both with alternate smile 
and tears 
when were all in the drawing-room the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they noon found that jane had no intelligence to give 
the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not at deserted her 
she still expected that it would all eddy well and that every morning would bring some letter either from india or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage 
mrs bonnet to whole apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected 
with tears and lamentations of regret invective against the villains conduct of william and complaints of her own suffering and ill-usage 
blaming everybody but the person to whole ill-judged indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing 
if i had been able d said the c to carry my point in going to brighton with all my family tin would not have happened boor dear india had nobody to take care of her

oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all but mr gardener though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears 
and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters 
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that on only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject 
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and fifty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before 
one came from her books and the other from her toilette 
the faces of both however were tolerant calm 
and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself occurred in the business had given something more of forgetfulness than usual to the accents of fifty 
as for mary she was mistress enough of herself rio whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection won after they were seated at table 
— a this is a most unfortunate admirer and will probably be much talked of 
but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of easterly consolation loft pride and prejudicial lichen

he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying 
and from label i am inclined to hope he i t have been misunderstood before a and til colonel forester came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married 
b c how was it bible that such an idea should enter our brains i i fell t a little uneasy 
a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right 
my father and mother knew nothing of that 
they only felt how imprint a match it must be

i should never be happy without him to think it no harm to beef 
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign to name a liar wickham.’ what a good joke it will 
i can hardly write for laughing 
pray make my excuse to protect for not keep in my engagement and dancing with him to-night

cried elizabeth when ll had finished it 
a hat a letter is thin to be written at such a moment 
but at least it show that as was serious in the object of her journey 
whatever he might afterward persuade her to it was not on her side a bone in infamy 
my poor father 
how he must have felt it 
d i never saw any one so shocked 
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes 
my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole home in such collision a pride and prejudice 
1000 oh 
jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day 2 d i do not know 
— hope there wan 
but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult 
my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done 
but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties you advance upon her has been too much for you 
you do not look well 
oh that i had been with you l 
you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone mary and fifty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them 
fifty is slight and delicate 
and ma studies so much that her hours of repose should more broken in on 
my aunt pips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away 
and was so good as to stay till thus with me 
she was of great use and comfort to sell 
kind lady lucy has been very kind 
she walked here on wednesday morning to condoled with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us a she had better have stayed at home a cried lizard berth 
a perhaps she mean well but under such a misfortune as this one can not see too little of one neighbours 
assistance is impossible 
condolence onst

let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied 
she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter 
he meant i believe 2 replied jane to go to no pride and prejudicial enow the place where they lax changed hornets lee the postilion and try if anything could be made out from them 
his principal object must be to discover the number of the hacked coach which took them from clapping 
it had come with a fare from london 
and at he thou het thecircumuaooe of a gentleman and lady removing morn one carriage into another might be remark he mounted mnkcinquiriet at langham

hum 11:30 
he whole party were in hope of a letter from mr bonnet the next roaming but the 11th came in without bringing a single line from him 
his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent 
but at 
such a time they had hoped for exertion 
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to lend 
but even of 26 they would ha been lad to be certain 
mr gardener had waited only or the letter 
before he net o 
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr bonnet to return to longbonrn up soon as he could to the great consolation of his linen who considered it an pride and prejudice 
i the only security for her husband not being killed in a dull 
mrs gardeners and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thou hit her presence might be serviceable to her nice 
he shared in their attendance on mrs bonnet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom 
heir other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and threatening them tap 
though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham’s extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more spirited than she found them 
all hareton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light 
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigue all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesman family 
everybody declared that he was the wickedness young man in the world 
and everybody began to and out that they had always distrusted the n prance of his goodness 
elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin still more certain 
and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them 
mr gardener left longbourn on sunday 
on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street 
that mr bonnet had been to pomp and a pride and prejudice 
claim before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information 
and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr bonnet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings 
mr gardener himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it 
he added that mr bonnet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon 
there was also a outstript to this effect 
d i have written to colonel forester to desire him to and out if possible from some of the young man's intimate in the regiment whether wicked has any relations or connection who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself 
if there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential confuse hence 
at present we have nothing to guide us 
co one forester will i dare say 
do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head 
but on second thoughts perhaps izz could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other orson elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded 
but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved 
she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years 
it was possible however that some of his companions in the 
— hire might be able to give more information 
and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something 
a look forward to 
pride and prendiceii3 every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety 
but the most anxious part of each was when the east was ax cited 
the arrival of letters was the rest and of jet of every moment i impatience 
thou h letters whatever of good or d was to be told you d be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance 
but before they heard again from mr gardener a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr colling 
which as jane had received directions to a n all that came for him in his absence she according y read 
and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise 
it was as follows 
a mr dane 
sin 
i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condoled with you on the grievous affliction you are now lumbering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire 
be assured my dear sir that mrs cousins and myself sincerely sympathize with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove 
no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune 
or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most admitting to a parent mind 
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comes vision of this 
and it is the more to be lamented use there is reason to suppose as my dear chariot informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence 
thou h at the same time for the consolation of yourself an mrs bonnet i am inclined to think that her own disposition 10 
h 104 pride and prejvdicemust be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early on age 
however that may be you are grievances to be tied 
in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs hollis but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair 
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be curious to the fortunes of all the others 
for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family 
and this consideration leads me moreover to re act with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november 
for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace 
let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw of 
your unworthy child from your infection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence 
i am dear sir c. 8s. mr gardener did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forester 
and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send 
it was not known that william had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living 
his former acquaintance had been numerous 
but since he had been in the military it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them 
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him 
and in the wretched state of his own branches there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by elysian s relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount 
colonel forester believed that more than a thousand rim and prejudice 
i is undawwldheneoe-irytoclearhiaexpemat brighton 
he owed a deal in the town but his debt of honoorwere more formidable 
mr gardener did not attempt to conceal these particularly from the longbourn burly 
jane heard them with horror 
d a tear a die cried 
this in wholly unexpected 
i not an idea of it a mr gardener added in his letter that they might expect to lee their father at home on the following day which was saturday 
rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavour he had yielded to his brother-in-law entirely that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit 
when mrs bonnet was told of thin she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before 
what in he coming home and without poor india 
d she cried 
a sure he will not leave london before he has found them 
who is to light wicket and make him marry her if he comes away 
d as my garden began to wish to he at home it was resulted that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr kenneth came from it 
the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought in master back to leghorn 
my garden went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyahire friend that had attended her from that raft of the world 
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece 
and the kind of half-expectation which my garden had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing 
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from temperly 
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any no pride and prejudice 
other excuse for the owner of her spirit unnecessary 
nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that 
though elizabeth who was by thin time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings wan perfect 
aware that had the known nothing of fancy the on d have borne the dread of lydia’a infamy somewhat better 
it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two 
when mr bonnet arrived he had all the a of hit natural philosophy composure 
he aid at little at he had ever been in the habit of laying 
made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was tome time before hell daughter had courage to speak of it 
it wan not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject 
and then on her briefly expressing her ioitovi for what he must have endured he replied a say nothing of that 
who should suffer but myself 
it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it 
you must not be too severe upon yourself a replied elizabeth 
b you may well warn me against such an evil 
human nature is no root to fall into it 
no dizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame 
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression 
it will pass away soon enough d do you supply them to be in london 
a b you 
where else can they be 10 well concealed 
a k c and ladies used to want to go to london 2 added it 
a life is happy then a said her father drily 
e and her residence there will probably be of some duration then after a short silence he continued 
a lazy i hear you no ill-will for being justified in pride and prejudice 
1801 your advice to me last may which considering the event shows some greatness of mind 
they were interrupted by miss bonnet who came to fetch her mother s tea 
this is a parade 2 cried he d which does one good 
it gives such an eley lance to misfortune 
another day i will do the same 
will lit in my library in my nightcap and pondering gown and give as much trouble as i can 
— or perhaps i may defer it till ditty runs away 
d i am not in to run away em a said fifty fretfully 
d if should ever go to right i would behave better than lydia.” b you go to brighton 
i would not insist on so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds 
no ditty l have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it 
no face is ever to enter my house again nor even to as through the village 
balls will be absolutely profit tied unless you stand up with one of your sisters 
and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of eve day in n rational manner 
lazily who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry 
well we d said he d do not make yourself unhasp y 
if you are a good girl for the next ten years i take you to a review at the end of there churn 150 
we days after mr bonnets return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shabbily behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her 
but instead of the expected summons when they i l 3 pride and prejudice 
approached her she said to miss bonnet d i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have not some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask what do you mean ill 2 we have heard nothing from town a dear madam 2 cried mrs hill in great astonishment don't ou know there is an express come or master from r gardener 
he has been here this half-hour and master has had a letter away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech 
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room 
from thence to the library 
— their father was in neither 
and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said 
d if you are looking for my master ma'am he is walking towards the little corpse upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the peacock 
jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon flagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out 
— oh papa what news 
what news 
have you heard from my uncle 
a yes i have had a letter from limb expressed a well and what news does it bring 
good or bad 
d a what is there of good to be expected i 
said he taking the letter from his pocket 
a but perhaps you would like to read it 
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand 
jane now came up 
pride and prejudice 
149 2 read it aloud 2 laid their father a for i hardly know myself what it is about a grace-church street monday august 2 
a my tom balm 
at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give on satisfaction 
soon after you left me on saturday 
was fortunate enough to and out in what part of london they were 
the particulars i reserve all we meet it is enough to know they are covered 
i have seen them both a b then it is as i always hoped a cried jane 
a they are married 
a elizabeth read on 
d i have seen both 
they are not married nor can i can and there was any intention of being no 
but if you are willing to perform the engagement which i have ventured to make on your side i ho e it will not be long before they are 
all that is required of you in to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the cave thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister 
and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum 
these are conditions which considering everything i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privilege for you 
i shall send thin by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer 
you will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr wickham’s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to he 
the world has been deceived in that respect 
and i am hasp y to so there will be some little money even when a his d ts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own 120 pride and prejudice 
fortune 
if as i conclude will be the cane you send me full were to act in your name throughout the whole of thin business i will immediately give direction to hareton for preparing a proper settlement 
there will not be the smallest occasion for our coming to town again 
therefore stay quietly at inngboum and depend on my diligence and care 
send back your answer as soon as you came and be careful to write exactly 
we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve 
she comes to no to-day 
i shall write again as noon at anything more is determined on 
yours c 
a new 
gunman.” win it possible 
a cried elizabeth when she had finished 
a can it be possible that he will marry her i d a wicker is not so deserving then as we have thought him a said her sister 
my dear father i congratulate you d and have you answered the letter 
said elizabeth 
d no 
but it must be done soon 
most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote 
a oh 
my dear father a she cried a come back and write immediately 
consider how important every moment is in such a case a let me write for you said jane d if you dislike the trouble yourself 
d i dislike it very much a he replied 
a but it must be done and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house 
and may i ask 
a said elizabeth 
but the terms i suppose must be complied with pride and prejudice 
in a complied with 
i am only ashamed of his asking so little c and they mim 
marry i yet he is and a man a yes yes they must marry 
there is nothing else to be done 
but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about 
and the other how i am ever to pay him 
money 
my uncle 
a cried jane what do you mean sir p i mean that no man in his senses would marry india on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone 
2 that is very true d said elizabeth 
though it had not occurred to me before 
his debts to be discharged and something still to remain 
oh 
it must be my uncle doings 
generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself 
a small sum could not do all this 
d no d said her father 
a wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds 
i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship ten thousand pounds 
heaven forbid 
how is half such a sum to be repaid 9 mr bonnet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house 
their father then went to the library so write and the girls walked into the breakfast-room 
e and they are really to be married 
cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves 
a how strange this is 
and for big we are to be thankful 
that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice 
oh india 
d i comfort myself with thinking replied jane in 220 pride and prejudice 
2 that he certain would not marry ladies if he had not a real regard or her 
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i can not believe that ten thousand pounds or anything like it has been advanced 
he has children of his own and may have more 
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds 2 if we were ever able to learn what wiekham's debts have been said elizabeth 
e and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr garden has done for them because wicked has not expense of his own 
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited 
their taking her home and according her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude can not enough acknowledge 
by this time she is actually with them 
if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy 
what a meeting for her when she burst lees my aunt 
2 we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane d i hope and trust they will at be happy 
his commenting to marry her is a proof will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking 
their mutual affection will steady them 
and i fatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten their conduct has been such a replied elizabeth was neither you nor i nor anybody can ever forget 
it is useless to talk of it 
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened 
they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her 
he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied 
mops and prejudice 
421 just as you please 2 may we take my uncle letter to read to her 
a stake whatever you like and get away elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table and they went upstairs together 
try and kites were both with mrs bonnet one communication would therefore do for all 
after slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud 
mrs bonnet could hardly contain herself 
as soon as jane had read mr gardeners hope of ladies being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance 
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been get from alarm and vexation 
to know that her daughter would be married was enough 
she was disturbed by no far for her felicity nor mumbled by any remembrance of her conduct 
a dear dear india 
d she cried 
a this is delight ull indeed 
— she will be married 
i shall see her again 
— she will be married at sixteen l 
my good kind brothers i knew how it would be 
— all knew he would manage ever in 
how i long to see her 
and to see dear chasm too 
but the clothes the wedding clothes 
i will write to my sister gardener about them directly 
izzy 
my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her 
stay stay i will go myself 
ring the bell ditty for h l. i will put on my things in a moment 
my dear dear india 
— how merry we shall be together when we meet 
a her eldest daughter endeavour to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardeners behaviour laid them all under 
for we must attribute this happy conclusion d she added in a great measure to his kindness 
we are 12s ran an wench wmlklﬂlpkdgd himselftoa-iimr khan with money well a cried her mother it is all very right 
whodwulddoitbut her an uncle 
he had not had a family of his own i and my children mun have had all his money

how well it sounds 
and the was only sixteen lax june 
— my dear jane i am in such a scutter that i am sure i can't write 
an i will dictate and you write for me 
we will nettle with your father about the money afterwards 
but the things should he ordered immediately she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly hare dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted 
one day delay the observed would be formally importance 
and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate a usual 
other scheme 
too came into her had 
31 will go to marlott if she d as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister pips

oh i here comes hill 
my dear hill have you heard the good news 
miss india is going to be married 
and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make me at her wedding men hi i began instantly to expect her joy 
elizabeth received her congratulation amongst the rest and then lick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom pride and prejudice 
2 poor dials situation must at best be bad enough 
but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful she felt it so 
and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected or her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained

r bonnet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him 
he now wished it more than ever 
had he done his duty in that respect india need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her 
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place 
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law and he was determined if possible to and out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could 
when first mr bonnet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless 
for of course they were to have a son 
this son was to join in cutting off the tails as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for 
five daughters successive entered the world but yet the son was to come 
and mrs bonnet for many years after dials birth had been certain that he would

this event had at last been d red of but it was then too late to be saving 
mrs ernest had no turn for economy and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income 
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bonnet and the children 
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the agents 
this was one point with regard to india at can which was now to he ended and mr bonnet could have no hesitation in according to the proposal before him 
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed molt concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect ape ration of all that was done and his willing nest to fulfil the engagements that had been made g him 
he had never before supposed that could wicker be prevailed on to many his daughter it would he done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement 
he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the lover by the hundred that was to be paid them i for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed tother through her mother hands india s expenses had been ve little within that sum 
hat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome s rule 
for his wish at present was to have as little to lie in the business as possible 
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence 
his letter was soon despatched 
for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution 
he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry wid liar to send my message to her 
the good news quickly spread through the house mim

to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss l dial bonnet come upon the town

but there was much to be talked of in marrying her 
and the good-natured wishes for her well-paying which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in hareton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain 
it was a fortnight since mrs bonnet had been downstairs

he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex 
but while he was mortal there must be a triumph 
she began now to come behead that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her 
his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes 
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her case and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved

how wicked and ladies were to be upon in tolerable independence she could not imagine 
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture

mr gardener soon wrote again to his brother 
to mr bonnets acknowledgment he briskly with assurances of his eagerness prompted the welfare of any of his family 
and concluded with counties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again 
the rick purport of his letter was to inform them that in kicking had resolved on quitting the military

3 mr bonnet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham’s removal from the

but mrs bonnet was not so well pleased with it 
ladies being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her come my for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe discontent 
and besides it was such a pity that indian should be taken from a re diment where she was acquainted with everybody and has 
so many favourites 
d she is so fond of mrs forever a said she d it will be quite shocking to send her away 
and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much 
the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment 
his daughters re nest for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative 
but glane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longboum as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished 
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to show her married daughter in the new boyhood before she was banished to the north 
hen mr bonnet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come 
and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn 
elizabeth was surprised however that wicked should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes

heir sister's wedding-day arrived 
and jane and elizabeth felt for her 
probably more than she felt for herself 
the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinner-time 
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bonnets and jane more especially who gave india the feelings which would have attended herself had as been the culprit and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure 
they came 
the family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive them 
smiles decked the face of mrs kenneth as the carriage drove up to the door 
her husband looked impenetrably grave 
her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy 
ladies voice was heard in the vestibule 
the door was thrown open and she ran into the room 
her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture 
gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wicked who followed his lady and wished dern both joy with an alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness 
their reception from mr bonnet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial 
his countenance rather aimed in austerity and he scarcely opened his li s. lathe easy assurance of the young couple 
and was enough to provoke him 
elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bonnet was shocked 
dial was india still 
untamed abashed wild noisy and fearless 
she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulation 
and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there 
pride and prejudice 
31 william was not at all more distressed than herself 3 but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all 
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance 
but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impatient man 
she blushed and jane blushed 
but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no varieties of colour 
there was no want of discourse 
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough 
and withal who happened to sit near elizabeth began inquiring after his acquaintance that neighbourhood with a good-humoured easeswhich she felt very unable to equal in her replies 
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world 
nothing of the past was recollected with gain 
and ladies led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world 
only think of its being three months d she cried a since i went away 
it seems but a fortnight i declare 
and yet there have been things enough happened in the time 
good gracious 
when i went away i am sure 10 had no more idea of being married till i came back again 
though i thought it would be ve good fun fit was 
er father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth looked expressive at india 
but she who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued 
oh 
mamma do the people hereabouts know i am married to-day 
i was afraid they might not 
and we overtook william sounding in his terrible so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next 104 pride and prejudice to him and took oil my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window-panes so that he might 
see the rain 
and then i howled and smiled like anything 
elizabeth could hear it no longer 
she got up and ran out of the more and returned no more till she heard them paling through the hall to the diningyarlour 
she then joined them soon enough to see die with anxious parade walk up to her mother's right hand and hear her my to her eldest sister aah jane i take your place now and you mun go lower because i am a maid woman 
it was not to be sun on that time would give india that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first 
her ease and good spirits increased 
she longed to see mrs hills the cakes and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs wickham” by each of them 
and in the meantime 
she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to mrs hill and the two housemaid 
well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast-room c and what do you think of my husband 
is not he a cunning man 
i am sure my sisters must all envy me 
i only ho they may have half my good luck they must all go to brighton 
that is the place to get husbands 
what a pity 
is mamma we did not all go 
a very true 
and if i had my will we should 
but my dear l die i doubt at all like your going such a way all 
out it be so 2 oh lord 
yes 
there is nothing in that 
i shall like it of all things 
you and papa and my sisters must come salmon and see us 
we shall be it rucastle all the winter and i dare say there am ll be some hello and i will take care to get good partners for them all pride and prejudice 
150 i should like it beyond anything 
said her mother 
e and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you 
and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over i thank on for my share of the favour d said elizabeth 
but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands 
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them 
mr william had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight 
no one but mrs bonnet regretted that their stay would be so short 
and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent ties at home 
these parties were acceptable to 
l to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not 
wickham’s affection for dial was just what elizabeth had expected to and it 
not equal to india s for him 
she had scarcely needed her resent observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his 
and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to cope with her at all had she not felt certain that his light was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances 
and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion 
dial was exceedingly fond of him 
he was her dear william on every occasion 
no one was to be put in competition with him 
he did cvcrytlring best in the world 
and she was sure he would kill more birds on the rest of september than anybody else in the country

however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my mr wicker 
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat

i thought it would never be over 
for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid nun cannut all the time i was with them 
if you believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight 
not one party or scheme or anything

but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out 
however i recollected afterwards that if he bad been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for big dare might have done as well

repented elizabeth in utter amazement 
a oh yes l 
he was to come there with william you know 
but gracious me 
i quite forgot 
i ought not to have said a word about it

you may depend upon my seeking no further 2 oh

d thank you d said l dial

ut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible 
or at least it was impossible not to try for information 
mr dairy had been at her sisters wedding 
it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least term action to go 
conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain 
but she was satisfied with none 
those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable 
she could not hear such suspense 
and hastily seizing sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what india had drop if it were comparable with the secrecy which had it intended

— till it a peaked whether her inquiries would receive any satin action the had rather be without a confidant

elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she sensibly could 
she was no sooner in possession o it than heu ling into the little close where she was least likely to interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy 
for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial

my mail mines 
i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee test a little writing will not comprised what i have to tell yah 
i must confess myself surprised by your applicapride and prejudice 
30 lion 
i did not expect it from you 
don't think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined ouch inquiries be necessary on your aid 
if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impatience 
your uncle ll as much surprised at i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he hat done 
but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit 2 on the ve day of my coming home from longboum your one e had a most unexpected visitor 
mr dairy called and was shut up with him several hours 
it wan all over before i arrived 
so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked your seems to have been 
he came to tell r garden that he had found out where your sister and mr wicker were 
and that he had seen and talked with them both 
wicked repeatedly india once 
from what i can collect he left berkshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them 
the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham’s worthlescnese had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him 
he generously intend the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world 
his character was to speak for itself 
he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself 
if he bad number motive i am sure it would never disgrace him 
he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them 
but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had 
and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow ill 
4d pride and prejudice 
a there is a lady it seems a mrs youngster who was some time ago governess to miss dairy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disspprobation though he did not say what 
she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings 
this my younger 
was he knew intimately acquainted with william 
and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town 
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted 
she would not betray her trust i so poses without robbery and corruption for she really did now where her friend was to be found 
wicked indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her 
at length however our kind friend procured the wished-for direction 
they were in street 
he saw william and afterwards insisted on seeing india 
his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go 
but he found india absolutely resolved on remaining where she was 
she cared for none of her friends 
she wanted no help of his 
she would not bar of leaving wicker 
she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when 
since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with william he easily ant had never been li design 
he confessed himself f obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and crumpled not to lay all the ill consequences of ladies right on her own folly alone 
he meant to resign his commission immediately 
and as to his nature situation he could pride and prejudice 
421 conjecture very little about it 
he must go together but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on 
mr darch asked him why he had not married your enter it once though mr bonnet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been generated by marriage 
but he found in reply to this question that wicked still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country 
under such circumstances however he was not likely to he proof against the temptation of immediate relief 
they met several times for there was much to be discussed 
wicked of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable 
a everything being settled between slim mr darch next st was to make our uncle acquainted with it and he st called in fenchurch street the evening before i came home 
but mr gardener could not be seen and mr darch found on further inquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning 
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former 
he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business 
a on saturday he came again 
your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together 
they met again on sunday and then i saw him too 
it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longboum 
but our visitor was ve obstinate 
i fancy dizzy that obstinacy is the m defect of his character after all 
149 pride and prejudice 
he has been accused of many faults at different times but rein is the me one 
nothing was to be done that that he did not do himself 
though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole 
a they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved 
but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain 
and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due 
but izz this must go no farther than yourself or jane at 
most 
you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people 
his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased 
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above 
it was owing to him to his reserve and want 
of proper consideration that wickham’s character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was 
perhaps there was some truth in mr though i doubt whether bai reserve or anybody reserve can be miserable for the event but in spite of all this one talking my dear izzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for months immured in the affair 
a when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at temperly 
but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when pride and prejudice 
4 the wedding took lace and all money matters were then to receive the as banish 
d i believe i have now told you everything 
it if a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise 
i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure 
ladies came to us 
and william had constant admission to the house 
10 was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire 
but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with bar behaviour while she stayed with us if i had not received by james letter last wednesday that her condition on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain 
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family 
if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen 
i was sometimes quite provoked but then i collected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her 
mr dairy was punctual in his return and as india informed you attended the wedding 
he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again in 
wednesday or thursday 
will you be very angry with me my dear izz if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never hold enough to say before how much like him 
his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in berkshire 
his understanding and opinions all please me 
he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and dial if he marry prudently his wife may teach him 
i thought him very sly 
— he hardly ever mentioned your name 
but slyness seems the fashion

it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return 
they owed the restoration of india her character everything to him 
oh 
how heartily did the grieve over every ungraciously sensation she had ever encouraged every tan speech she had ever directed towards him 
for herself the was tumbled 
but the was proud of him 
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself 
she read over her aunt commendation of him again and again 
it was hardly enough 
but it pleased her 
she wan even sensible of some plenary though mixed with regret on ending how steadfastly both the and her uncle had been persuaded that a lion and conscience submitted between mr dairy and herself 
she was roused from her seat and her selection by come once approach 
and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wicked

that you actually declared our resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly b you did l 
and it was not wholly without foundation 
you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it the were now almost at the door of the house for she ha walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters cake to provoke him she only said in reply with a good-humoured smile 
d come mr wicker we are brother and sister you know 
do not let us quarrel about the past 
in future i hope we shall be always of one mind 
she held out her hand 
he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house 
149 ram and prejudicial chapter 31 
r william was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it 
and she was pleased to and that she had said enough to keep him quiet 
the do of his and dial departure soon came and mrs bonnet was forced submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to rucastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth 
a oh 
my dear india d she cried a when shall we meet again 
oh lord 
i don't know 
not these two or three cares perhaps a rite to me very often my dear 
d as often as i can 
but you know married women have never much time for writing 
my sisters may write to my 
they will have nothing else to do 
mr wickham’s adieux were much more affectionate than his wife's 
he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things 
he is as one a fellow a said mr kenneth as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw 
he whimpers and sticks and makes love to us all 
i am prodigiously proud of him 
i defy even sir william judas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.” the loss of her daughter made mrs bonnet very dull for several day i 
d i often think a said she 2 that there is nothing so bad as parting with one s friends 
one seems so forlorn without them a this is the consequence you see adam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth 
a it must pride and prejudice 
149 make you better satisfied that your other four are single it is no such thing 
l dis does not leave me because she is married 
but on y because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off 
if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon 
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation 
the housekeeper at tethered had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks 
mrs bonnet was quite in the edge 
she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns 
well well and so mr hindley is coming down sisters for mrs lips first brought her the news 
a well so much the better 
not that i care about it though 
he is nothing to us you know and 10 am sure i never want to see him again 
but however he is very welcome to come to tethered if he likes it 
and who knows what may happen 
but that is nothing to us 
you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it 
and so is it quite certain he is coming 2 b you may depend on it replied the other for mrs nights was in hareton last night 
i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it 
and she told me that it was certainly true 
he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday 
she was going to the catchers she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of bucks just at to be killed miss bonnet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour 
it was many months since 150 pride and prejudice 
she had mentioned his name to elizabeth 
but now ii soon as they were alone together she said 
— i saw you look at me to-day line when m aunt told us of the present report 
an i know i oop armed distressed 
but don't imagine it was from any ull y cane 
i was only confused for the moment because felt that i should be looked at 
i do assure you that the news does not expect me either with pleasure or pain 
i am glad of one thing 
that he comes alone 
because we shall see the less of him 
not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other peor lees remarks elizabeth did not know what to make of it 
had she not seen him in berkshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged 
but she still thought him partial to june and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friends permission or being bold enough to come without it 
yet it it hard a she sometimes thought that this poor man can not come to a house which he has les lily hired without raising all this speculation 
i said save him to himself in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it 
they were more disturbed more on wall than she had often seen them 
he subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again 
d as soon as ever mr hindley comes my dear d said mrs bonnet b you will wait on him of course 
no no 
you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should pride and prejudices 
marry one of my daughters 
but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a foolish errand against his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to tethered 
is an coquette i despise d said he 
d if he wants our society let him seek it 
he knows where we live 
i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again well all i know is that it will be abominable rude if you do not wait on him 
but however that shut prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined 
we must have mrs long and the foldings soon 
that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him consoled by this resolution she was the better able to hear her husband's civility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr hindley in corn fence of it before me did 
as the day of his arrival drew near a i begin to be sorry that he comes at all a said jane to her sister 
it would be nothing 
i could see him with perfect indifference 
but i can hardly beer to hear it thus perpetually talked of 
my mother means well 
but she does not know 
no one can know 
how much i suffer from what she says 
happy shall i be when his stay at tethered is over 
a d i wish i could say anything to comfort you d replied elizabeth 
but it is wholly out of my power 
you must feel it 
and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much 
mr hindley arrived 
mrs bonnet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and forgetfulness on her side might be as long as it could 
she counted 1/2 pride and prejudice 
the days that must intervened before their invitation could be sent 
hopeless of seeing him before 
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the pack and ride towards the house 
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy 
jane resolutely kept her place at the table 
but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the window 
she looked 
she saw mr dry with him and sat down again by her sister 
there is a gentleman with him mamma d said fifty 
who can it be 2 b c some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose 
i am sure i do not know 
a la 
a replied ditty 
it looks just like that man that used to he with him before 
— mr what his name 
— that tall proud mun a good gracious 
mr darch 
— my so it does i vow 
well any friend of mr hindley's will always be welcome here to be sure 
but else i must say that 
i hate the very sight of him jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern 
she knew but little of their meeting in berkshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanation letter 
both sisters were uncomfortable enough 
each felt for the other and of course for themselves 
and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr dairy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr jingle as friend without being heard by either them 
tint elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to show mrs gardeners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him 
to jane he could be only a man whose proposal she had refused pride and prejudice 
5.30 and whose merit she had unvalued 
but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the rest of beasts and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not write so tender at least as reasonable and just as what are felt for hindley 
her astonishment at his coming 
at his coming to tethered to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in berkshire 
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional low and a smile of delight added lustre to her e s as s e thought for that space of time that his actions and wishes must still be unshaken 
but she would not be secure 
d let me first see how he behaved said she 
a it will then be earl enough for expectation 
she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door 
jane looked a little paler than usual but more date than elizabeth had expected 
on the gentleman's appearing her colour increased 
yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary compliance 
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command 
she had ventured only one glance at dairy 
he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at temperly 
but perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt 
it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture 
hindley she had likewise seen for an instant and in r 4 runs arm price 
thatahortperiod uwlﬁmlmkinghoth dand exhausted 
hewureceivedbymn with a degree of civility which made her two daughter 
amazed especially when contrasted with the cold and aluminium politeness of her clumsy and address of his en 
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the reservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill lied 
percy after inquiring of her how mr and my garden did 
a question which she could not answer without confusion 
said scarcely anything 
he was not seated by her 
perhaps that was the reason of his silence 
but 
it had not been so in berkshire 
there he had talked to her friends 
when he could not so herself 
but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice 
and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and fro absently on no object but the ground 
more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed 
she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so 
could i expect it to be otherwise 
a said the 
a yet why did he come 2 
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself 
and to him she had hardly courage to s k 
peace inquired after his sister but could do no more 
it is a long time mr hindley since you went away said mrs bonnet 
lie readily agreed to it 
i began to be afraid you would never come back again 
pen les aid say a meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas 
grit pride and prejudice 
l however i ho it is not true 
a great many changes have ha peering the neighbourhood since you went away 
is lucy is married and settled 
and one of my own daughters 
i suppose you have heard of it 
indeed you must have seen it in the papers 
it was in the times and the course i know 
though it was not put in as it ought to be 
it was only said a lately george wicker e 
to miss india bonnet 2 without there being a syllable e said of her father or the place where she lived or anything 
it was my brother gardeners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it 
did you see it 10 a single replied that he did and made his congratulation 
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes 
how mr darch looked therefore she could not tell 
a it is a delightful thing so be sure to have a daughter well married 
continued her mother 
but at the same time mr hindley it is very hard to have her taken away from me 
they are gone down to rucastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long 
his regiment is there 
for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shore and of his being gone into the regular 
thank heaven 
he has ram friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves 
elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr dairy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat 
it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before 
and she asked hindley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present 
a few weeks he believed 
a when you have killed all your own birds mr jingled said her mother a i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr bonnets manor

x hindley looked a little silly at this reception and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business 
th then went away 
mrs bonnet ha been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day 
but though she always kept a very good table she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand years 
chance 1100 
s soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirit 
or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deadens them more 
mr darch behaviour astonished and vexed her 
why if he came only to be silent grave and indiﬁcrcnt d said she a did he come at all i she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure 
he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town 
and wh not to me 
if he fears me why come hither 
i he no longer cares for me 
why sileni 
fearing tossing man 
i will think no more about him 
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the nap reach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful nook which showed her better satiated with their visitors than elizabeth 
now a said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy 
i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming 
i am glad he dined here on tuesday it will then be publicly 1858 pride and prejudicial seen that on both sides we met only as common and indifferent acquaintance 
a yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly 
a oh jane 
take cared a my dear izzy you can not think me so weak as to be in danger how d i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as over the did not see the gentlemen again till today 
and mrs bent in the meanwhile was giving way to all the heap y schemes which the good humour and common whiteness of mingled in half-an-hour s visit had revived 
on tuesday there wast a large party usernbled at longboum 
and the two who were most anxious expected to the credit of their punctuality an apt 
men were in very good time 
hen they r ‘iil’t‘d to the dining-room elizabeth eagerly watch to see whether hindley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister 
her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbade to invite him to sit by herself 
on entering the room he seemed to hesitate 
hut jane happened to look round and happened to smile 
it umf decided 
he placed himself by her 
elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked to words his friend 
he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that hindley had received his action to be happy had she not seen his eye likewise turned towards nil 
dry with an expression of half-laughing alarm 
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane s happiness and his own pride and prejudicial 
149 would be speedily secured 
though the dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour 
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could bout s for she was in no cheerful humour 
mr dairy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them 
he was on one side of her mother 
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage 
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse 
but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did 
her mother ungraciouaneu made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth mind 
and she would at times have given anything to be privilege to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor felt by the whole of the family 
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together 
that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enacting them to enter into something more of convention than the mere ceremonies sea station attending his entrance 
anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that made her almost uncivil 
she looked onward to their entrance as the point on llehriechdall her chance of pleasure for the evening must n 
d if he does not come to me 150 d said she d i shall give him up for ever 
the gentlemen came 
and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes 
but alas 
the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bonnet was taking tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair 
and 60 name no rewards 
on the gentleman's approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper 
2 the men shan't come and part us i am determined 
we want none of them 
do we 2 
dare had walked away to another part of the room 
she for owed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to wife and then was enraged against herself f for being so silly 
d a man who has once been refused 
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love 
in there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the time woman 
there is no malignity so abhorrent to their feelings 
d she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee-cup himself 
and she seized the opportunity of saying 2 is your mister at temperly still i a b s she will remain there till christmas 
e and quite alone 
have all her friends left her 3 
a mrs annually is with her 
the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks she could think of nothing more to say 
but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success 
he stood by her however for some minutes in silence 
and at last on the young ladies whispering to elizabeth again he walked away 
when the tea-things were removed and the constables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrow by seeing him fall a victim to her mother capacity or whim-players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party 
she now lost every 
expectation of pleasure 
they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had pride and prejudice 
6d nothing to huge but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as successfully as herself 
mrs bonnet had designed to keep the two netheriield gentlemen to supper 
but their carriage was unlucky ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of retaining them 
well girls d said she as soon as they were left to themselves that say you to the day 
i think everything has passed all uncommonly well i assure you 
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw 
the vision was roasted to a turn 
and everybody said they never saw so fat at haunches 
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the cases last week 
and even mr darch acknowledged that the parties were remarkable well done 
and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least 
and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty 
mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not 
and what do you think she said besides 
ah 
mrs bonnet we shall have her it tethered at last she did indeed 
i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived 
and her vices are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously mrs bent in hurt was in very great spirits 
she had seen enough of bind keys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last 
and her expressions of advantage to her family when in 3 ha humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappoint at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposal 
a it has been a very agreeable day said miss bonnet to elizabeth 
the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other 
i hope we may often meet again no l 16a pride and prejudice 
elizabeth smiled 
a izzy you must not do so 
you must not suspect me 
it worries me 
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it 
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my abject lion 
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleading than any other man 
you are very camel said her sister 
you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment a how hard it is in some cases to he believed 
2 c and how impossible in others 
b c but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge 
a v that is s question which i hardly know how to answer 
we all love to construct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing 
f forgive me 
and if you persist in indifference do not make me your conﬁdante.” tempter 117 
few days after this visit mr tingly called again and alone 
his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time 
he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits 
mrs bonnet 2 this sentence s here separate from the next in according with a reference in 10 letter of miss attends to the pages of the rest ellen on which incur 
2 the greatest blunder in bringing is in 10 
no v. 3 where two sentences are made into one 
— en 
pride and prejudice 
6d invited him to dine with them 
but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere 
next time you call a said she i hope we shall he more lucky 2 he should be particularly ha play at any time c. c. and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them 
a can you come to-morrow 
a yes he had no engagement at all for to-morrow 
and her invitation was accepted with alacrity 
he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed 
in ran mrs bonnet to her daughters room in her dressing gown and with her hair half banished crying out a my dear jane make haste and hurry down 
he is come 
mr bandy is come 
he is indeed 
make haste make haste 
ere arab come to miss bonnet this moment and help her on with her gown 
never mind miss dizzy hair we will be down as soon as we can a said jane 
a but i dare say ditty is forwarded than either of us for she went upstairs half an hour ago oh 
hang little what has she to do with it 
come be quick be quick where is your sash my dear 
a but when her mother was gone jane would not he prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters 
the use anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening 
a tear tea mr bonnet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went upstairs to her instrument 
two obstacles of the cave being thus removed mrs bonnet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them 
elizabeth would not observe her 
and when at last fifty 16a pride and prejudice 
did she ve innocently said what is the matter mamma at do you keep winking at me for 
what am i to do 
d a nothing child nothing 
i did not wink at you 
she then sat still live minutes longer 
but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to lift a come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room 
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth 
which spoke her distress at such meditation and her entreaty that as would not give in to it 
in a few minutes mrs bonnet half opened the door and called out a lazy my dear i want to speak with you elizabeth was forced to go 
2 we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall 
a dirty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and city were out of sight then returned into the drawing-room 
mrs bonnet schemes for this day were ineffectual 
hindley was everything that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter 
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party 
and he bore with the ill-judged consciousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter 
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper 
and before he went away an engagement vows armed chiefly through his own and mrs bonnets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband 
after this day jane said no more of her indifference 
not a word passed between the sisters concerning pride and prejudice 
6d bring 
but elizabeth went to bed in the he pays belief that all must speedily be concluded unless r darch returned within the stated time 
seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's occurrence 
mingled was punctual to his appointment 
and he and mr bonnet spent the morning together as had been agreed on 
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected 
there was nothing of presumption or folly in hindley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence 
and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him 
hindley of course returned with him to dinner 
and in the evening mrs bonnets invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and her daughter 
elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after ten 
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mother schemes 
but on returning to the drawing-room when her letter was finished she saw to her innate surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her 
on opening the door she perceived her sister and hindley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation 
and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all 
palmer situation was awkward enow h 
but ban she thought was still worse 
not a sly able was uttered by either 
and elizabeth was on the point of going away again w e hindley who as well as the other had sat down sudden rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room 
jane could have no reserve from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure 
and instantly embrace 6d guns all 
natures 
in her acknowledged with the loveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world 
'tis too much she added 
a by far too much 
i do not deserve it 
oh 
why is not everybody as hasp y i a log izabeth’s congratulation were given with sincere a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express 
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane 
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present 
i must go instantly to my mother she cried 
d i would not on any account tried with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself 
he is gone to my father already 
oh 
izz to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family 
how shall i hear so much happiness 
d she then hastened away to her mother 
who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting upstairs with knitted 
elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation 
e and this said she 2 is the end of all his friends anxious circumspectly l of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest and most reasonable end 
in a few minutes she was joined by hindley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose 
a where is your sister 3 d said he hastily as he opened the door 
e with my mother upstairs 
she will be down in a moment i dare say mops and summon 
6d he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister 
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship 
they shook hands with great cordiality 
and then 10 her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own ha pines and ofjane’s perfection 
and in spite of his in a lover elizabeth recall believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent dis scion of jane and a general similarity of feeling an taste between her and himself 
it was an evening of no common delight to them all 
the satisfaction of miss bonnets mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever 
fifty whimpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon 
mrs bonnet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to jingle of nothing else for half an hour 
and when mr bonnet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was 
not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his lave for the night 
but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said 
a jane 10 congratulate you 
you will be a very happy woman jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness 
b you are a good girl 2 he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking on will be so happily settled 
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together 
your tempers are by no means unlike 
you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on 
so easy that every servant will cheat you 
and so generous that you will always exceed your income 16a pride and prejudice 
d i hope not so 
imprudence or thoughtlessness in mane matters would be pardonable in at 
a creed their income 
my dear mr bonnet cried his wife a what are you talking of 10 why he has four or ever thousand years and very likely more 
then addressing her daughter oh 
my dear dear jane i am so hasp y i am sure i shan't get a wink of sleep all night 
i knew how it would be 
i always said it must be so at last 
i was sure on could not be so beautiful for nothing 
firemen r as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together 
oh l he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen i a wicker india were all forgotten 
jane was beyond competition her favourite child 
at that moment she cared for no other 
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for object of happiness which she might in future be able to spend 
mary mentioned for the use of the library at tethered 
and fifty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter 
hindley from this time was of course a daily visitor atzlongboum 
coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper 
unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough dawned had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept 
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister 
for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else 
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur 
in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her 
and when being was gone anew constantly sought the same means of re if 
pride and rnzyumcu 
6d he has made me so happy said she one evening 2 by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town just spring i had not believed it possible i suspected as much a replied elizabeth 
but how did he account for it 2 
a it must have been his sister doing 
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i can not wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageous in many respects 
but when th see as i trusty will that theirbrotherisha wi me they will learn to be contented and we sh be on good terms again 
though we can never what we once were to each other that is the most forgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter 
good girl 
it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss hindley's pretended regard 
b c would ou believe it size that when he went to town last embers he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again 
b c he made a little mistake to be sure 
but it is to the credit of his modest this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane an his silence and the little value he put on his own good qualities 
elizabeth was pleased to and that he had not betrayed the inner fence of his friends 
for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him 
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed 
a cried jane 
oh 
izzy why am i thus singed from my family and blessed above them all 
if i could but see you as happy 
if there were but such another man for you 
750 pride and prejudice 
d if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you 
till i have your disposition your goodness 10 never can have your ha illness 
no no let me shift for myself f and perhaps i have very good luck i may meet with another mr collision time 
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret 
mrs bonnet was privilege to whisper it to mrs pills and lie ventured without 
w permission to do the same by all her neighbours in e n 
he bonnet were speedily pronounced to be the luckless family in the world though only a few weeks before when dial had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune 
charm 117 
ne morning about a week after hindley's engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room their attention wan suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage 
and they perceived a chaise-and-four driving up the lawn 
it was too early in the morning for elm and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours 
the horses were post 
and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them 
as it was certain however that somebody was coming hindley instantly prevailed on miss bonnet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubby 
they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though pride and prejudice ill with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered 
it was lady catherine de bough 
they were of course all intending to be surprised 
but their astonishment was beyond their ax station 
m on the rest of mrs bonnet and fifty ought she was perfect unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth fee t 
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungraciously made no other reply to elizabeth salutation than a slight infliction of the head and sat down without saying i word 
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship entrance though no request of introduction had been made 
mrs bent all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost listener 
after sitting for a moment in silence she said very silly to elizabeth 
— 
l hope you are well miss bonnet 
that lady i ill she is your mother 
a elizabeth replied very concisely that she was 
e and till i suppose it one of your sisters 
b c yes madam d said mrs bonnet delighted to speak to a lady catherine 
she is my youngest girl but one my youngest of all is lately married 
and my eldest is somewhere about the round walking with a young man who i believe wi soon become a part of the family 
you have a very small park here a returned lady catherine after a short silence 
a it is nothing in comparison of rousing my lady i dare say 
but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas’s.” this must be a most inconvenience sitting-room for the evening in summer the windows are full west 
i 7 i pride an d prejudicial 
more bent assured her that they never let there after dinner and then added 
— nay i take the liberty of asking our ladyship whether you left mr and my calling we p 2 yes very well 
i saw them the night before last 
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from marlott on it weeds the cold probable motive for her calling 
but no letter apparel and she was completely puzzled 
mr bonnet with great civility begged her ladyship to take tome refreshment 
but lad catherine very resolutely and not very politely dee iced eating anything 
and then rising up aid to elizabeth 
mim bonnet there seemed to be a praying kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn 
i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company d go my dear 2 cried her mother a and show her ladyship about the different walks 
i think she will be pleased with the hermit 
elizabeth obeyed an running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest downswinas they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the door 
into the dining-parlour and drawing 
room and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent-looking rooms walked on 
her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it 
they proceeded in silence hung the gravel-walk that led to the couple 
elizabeth was determined to make no efforts for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable 
chow could i ever think her like her nephew 
a said the an she looked in her face 
as won an they entered the corpse lady catherine began in the following manner pride and prejudice 
i 7s b you can be at no loss minx bonnet to understand the reason of my journey hither 
your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come 
elizabeth looked with unaffectedly astonishment 
indeed you are mistaken madam 
i have not teens all able to account for the honour of seeing you ere 
miss bonnet 2 replied her ladyship in an angry tone 2 ou ought to know that i am not to be trifled with 
ut however sincere you may choose to be you shall not and me so 
m character has ever been celebrated for in sincerity in frankness and in a chance of such moment as thus i shall certainly not depart from it 
a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago 
i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageous married but that you that miss elizabeth bonnet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew 
my own nephew 
mr darch 
though i lime it mun be a scandalous falsehood 
though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this pace that i might make my sentiments known to you if you believed it impossible to be true d said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain d i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far 
what could your ladyship propose by it i 
a at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted your coming to longbourn to see me and my family d said elizabeth coolly a will be rather a confirmation of it 
if indeed such a report is in existence if 
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it 
has it not been industrious circulates by yourselves 
149 pride and prejudicial 
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad 2 b c i never heard that it was and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it i d i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship 
you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer a this is not to be borne 
miss bonnet i insist on being satisfied 
has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage 
b c your ladyship has declared it to be impossible it ought to be so 
it must be so while he retains theme of his reason 
but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family 
you may have drawn him in a if i have i shall be the last person to confess it 
a miss bonnet do you know who i am 
i have not been accustomed to such language as this 
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerning a but you are not entitled to know mix 
nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit let me be rightly understood 
this match to which you have the pressure ton to aspire can never take place 
no never 
mr fancy is engaged to m daughter 
now what have you to say i 
d only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me 
lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied 
the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind 
from their infancy they have been intended for each other 
it was the favourite wish of li mother as well as of hers 
while in their candles we pride and prejudice 
if planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the word and wholly unallied to the family 
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends 
to his tacit engagement with miss c bough 
are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy 
have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin 
a 
yes and i had heard it before 
but what is that to me i if there is no other objection to m marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept me it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to mar miss de bough 
you both did as much as you cool in planning the marriage 
its completion depended on others 
if mr fancy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice 
and if i am that choice why may i not accept him 
b c because honour decorum prudence 
ma interest forbid it yes miss bonnet interest 
for c not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all 
you will be endured alighted and despised by every one connected with him 
your alliance will be a disgrace 
your name will never even be mentioned by any of us there are heavy misfortunes 2 replied elizabeth 
a but the wife of mr darch must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her adoration that she could upon the whole have no cause to repined 2 obstinate headstrong girl 
i am ashamed of soul is this your gratitude for my attentions to you t spring 
is nothing due to me on that score 
d let us sit down 
you are to understand miss 7s pride and prejudice 
kenneth that i came here with the determined retention of carrying my purpose 
nor will i be divided from it 
i have not been used to submit to any son s whim 
i have not been in the habit of brow in diary mmem.” 2 mul will make your ladyship situation at present more pitiable 
but it will have no effect on rue i will not be interrupted 
hear me in silence 
my daughter and my ne how are formed for each other 
they are dearer ed on the maternal side from the lame noble line 
and on the farther from table honourable and ancient though entitled familiar 
their fortune on both side in splendid 
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective bounce 
and what in to divide them 
the part prevention of a young woman without family connection or fortune 
in a this to be endured 
but it must not shall not be 
if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up a in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself an quitting that there 
he in a gentleman 
i am a gentleman daughter to far we are equally a rue 
you are gentleman's daughter 
but who was your mother 
who are your uncle 
and auntie do not imagine me ignorant of their condition 2 whatever my connection may be said elizabeth a if your nephew does not object to them they can be anything to you d tell me once for all are you engaged to him i though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moment deliberating d i am not lady catherine seemed pleased 
pride and prejudice 
red c and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement i d a i will make no promise of the kind a miss bonnet i am shocked and astonished 
i expected to and a more reasonable sung women 
but do not deceive yourself into a being that i will ever recede 
i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require 
and i certainly never shall give it 
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable 
your ladyship wants mr dared to marry your daughter 
but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable 
supposing him to be attached to me would in refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin 
allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which ye have supported this extraordinary application have n as frivolous as the application was ill-judged 
you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasion as these 
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in bill affairs i can not tell 
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine 
i must be 
therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject not so hasty if you lease 
have by no means done 
to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add 
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous also meant 
i know it all 
that the young man's marrying er was a patched-up business at the expense of your father and uncle 
and is met a girl to be my nephew s sister 
is her husband who is the son of his late father's seaward to be his brother 
heaven and earth 
of what are you drinking i are the shades of temperly to be thus polluted 
i you can now have nothing farther to say a she ii 
m l 7 85 pride and prejudice 
resentfully answered 
b you have insulted me in every possible method 
i must beg to return to the home and she rose as she spoke 
lady catherine role also and they turned back 
her ladyship was highly incensed 
b you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew 
unfeeling hellish girl 
do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody 
lady catherine i have nothing farther to say 
you know my sentiments b you are then resolved to have him 
d i have said no such thing 
i am only resolved on act in that manner which will in my own opinion continue my heap infer without reference to you or to any person so who lay unconnected with me a it in well 
you refuse then to oblige me 
you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude 
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world neither duty nor honour nor gratitude 2 replied elizabeth a has any possible claim on me in the present instance 
no principle of either would be visited by my marriage with mr darch 
and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment concern 
and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the corner a and this in your arm opinion 
this is your pal resolve 
very well 
i than 
now know how to act 
do not imagine miss bonnet that your ambition will ever be gained 
i came to try you 
i h m 
to and you reasonable 
but depend upon it i will carry my point pride and prejudicial 1870 in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were it the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added 
a d i take no leave of you miss bonnet 
i tend no compliment to your mother 
you deserve no such attention 
i am most seriously displace 
elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to made her ladyship to return into the house was ed quietly into it herself 
she heard the carriage drive away a he proceeded upstairs 
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the drawing-room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself 
d she did not choose it said her daughter 
d she would go a d she is a very on-looking woman 
and her calling here was prodigiously civil 
for the only came i suppose to to us the rolling were well 
she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through mention thought she might as well call on you 
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you izzy 
elizabeth wan forced to give in m a little falsehood here 
for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible 
thank 117 
he discompose of a rifts which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be crying overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly 
lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from roarings for the sole purpose of 1842 pride and morcar breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darch 
it was a rational scheme to be sure 
but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine 
till she recollected that hi being the intimate friend of hindley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to supply the idea 
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together 
and her neighbours at lucy lodge therefore for through their communication with the confines the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set rim 
down as almost certain and immediate which a had looked forward to as possible at some future time 
in revolving lady catherine's expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the stable consequence of her perishing in this interference 
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application of her nephew 
and how i might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce 
she knew not the exact degree of his agitation for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than be could do 
and it was certain that in enervating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connection were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side 
with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning 
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and pride and prejudice 
1801 entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity blemishes could make him 
in that clue he would return no more 
lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to jingle of coming again to netherlield must give way 
d if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days a she added 
i shall know how to demand it 
shall then give over every expectation 
every wish of his constancy 
if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at ill 
the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great 
but they obliging satisfied it with the me kind of supposition which 31 appeased mrs bonnets curiosity 
and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject 
the next morning as she was going downstairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand 
a izz said he i was going to look for you 
come into my room she followed him thither 
and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held 
it suddenly muck her that it might be from lady catherine 
and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent ax laudations 
she followed her father to the place and they both sat down 
he then said 
d i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly 
as it principally concerns yourself on ought to know its contents 
i did not know he or that i had we daughters on the brink of 1842 pride and prejudice 
matrimony 
let me congratulate you on a very important conquest the colour now rushed into elizabeth cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt 
and she was determined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or ended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself 
when her father continued 
a b you look conscious 
young ladies have great notation in such matters as these 
but i think may defy even aura sagacity to discover the name of your admirer 
his letter is from mr colling d from mr colling 
and what can be have to say 
a something very much to the purpose of course 
he begins with congratulation on the approaching pupils of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good-natured gossiping cases 
i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point 
what relates to yourself is as follows having thus offered you the sincere congratulation of mrs cousins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject another 
of which we have been advertised by the same authority 
your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bonnet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personage in this land a can you possibly guess izz who is meant by this 
— a this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with everything the heart of mortal can most desire 
splendid property noble kindred and extensive parsonage 
yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate close with this gentleman's proposal which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of pride and prejudice 
1801 d have you any idea izz who this gentleman is 
but now it comes out 
b c my motive for caution you is as follows we have reason to imagine that dismount lady catherine de bough does not look on the match with a friendly 4d 2 mr fancy you see is the man now izz i think i been surprised you 
could he or the cases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectual to what they related 
mr darch who never looks at any woman but to see a cherish and who probably never looked at you in his life 
it is admirably e 
elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry but could only ones one most reluctant smile 
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her 
a are you not diverted 
oh 
yes 
pray read on 
b c after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion 
when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match 
i thought it my duty to give the sleepiest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer ma be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ 
mr colling moreover adds d i am truly rejoiced that my cousin india s sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known 
i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into 1840 pride and prejudice 
your house as soon us they were married 
it was an encouragement of vice 
and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuous have opposed it 
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing 
— herbal is his notion of christian forgiveness 
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte’s situation and his expectation of s young olive-branch 
but izzy you look as if you did not enjoy it 
you are not going to be new i hope and pretend to be aﬁ'ronted at an idle report 
for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn 
b c oh l 2 cried elizabeth a i am excessively diverted 
but it is so strange 
a yes 
421 
is what makes it amusing 
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing 
but bai perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd 
much as i abominable writing i would not give up mr colling correspondence for any consideration 
nay when i read letter of his i can not help giving him the preference even over wicker much as i value the impudence and h cries of my sooin 
law 
and pray dizzy what said lady catherine about this report 
did she call to refuse her consent 2 c to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh 
and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it 
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not 
it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried 
her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr darch indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too link she might have fancied too rub 
pride and prejudice 
85 that 19th 
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr hindley to do he was able to bring dry with him to lnngbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's visit 
the gentlemen arrived early 
and before mrs bonnet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter satin momentary dread beings who wanted to be alone with jane rested their walking out 
it was agreed to 
n gleamed war not in the habit of walking 
mary could never spare time but the remaining live set off together 
hindley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstript them 
they gagged behind while elizabeth kith and dairy were to entertain each other 
very little was said b either city was too much afraid of him to talk 
e elizabeth wan secretly forming desperate resolution 
and perhaps he might be doing the same 
they walked towards the cases became ditty wished to call a n marian 
and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when ditty left them she went boldly on with him alone 
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed 
and while her courage was high she immediately said 
— a mr fancy i am a very selfish creature 
and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may he sounding yours 
i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kin to my poor sister 
ever since i have known it i have been most anxious acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it 
were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to ax run 
i am sorry exceedingly sorry a red iced diary in 1869 pride and prejudice 
a tone of surprise and emotion 2 that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken li t have given you uneasiness 
i did not 
think mrs order was so little to be true b you must not blame my aunt 
ladies thoughtlessness 31st betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter 
and of course i could not rest till knew the particulars 
let me thank you again and again in the name of ill my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortiﬁcstions for the sake of dis 
covering them if you will thank me a he replied a let it be for yourself alone 
that the wish of giving happiness to on might add force to the other enticements which ed me on i shall not attempt to deny 
but your snub owe me nothing 
much as i respect them i believe i thought only of your elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word 
after a short pause her companion added b you are too generous to tried with me 
if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once 
few affections and wishes are unchanged 
but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak 
and immediately though not very gently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances 
the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do 
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eyes she might have seen how well the 10 ii 
m 
pride arm prejudice 
1870 expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him s but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection eve moment more valuable 
hey walked on without knowing in what direction 
there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects 
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present od understanding to the efforts of his aunt who died on him in her return through london and there relate her purely to longboum its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth 
dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyship apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which as 
had refused to give 
but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrarywrse 
it taught me to ho 2 mid he was i had scarcely ever allowed myself to open before 
i knew enough of ur disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and o 10 elizabeth coloured and in hed as she replied 
yes you know enough of my hair to believe me capable of that 
after abusing on so abominable to your face i could have no scruples in abusing you to all your relations 
what did you say of me that i did not deserve 
for though your accusations were ill-founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof 
it was pardonable 
i can not think of it without abhorrence 
2 we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame 1858 mum and prejudice 
annexed to that evening d said elizabeth 
the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable 
but since then we have both i hope improved in civility i can not be so easily reconciled to myself 
the recollection of what i then said 
of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it 
is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me 
your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentlemanly manner those were your words 
you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me g 
though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression 
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way i can easily believe it 
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure on did 
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in anyupoasible way that would induce you to accept me 
oh 
do not repeat what i then said 
these recollections will not do at all 
i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of its dry mentioned his letter 
a did it a said he a did it man make you think better of me 
did you on reading it give any credit to its contents 
she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed 
d i knew a said he 2 that what i wrote must give you pain 
but it was necessary 
i hope you have destroyed the letter 
there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread you having the farm and rnmumcc 89 power of reading again 
i can remember some express 
stone which might instil make you hate me 
2 the letter sha l certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but 
thou h we have both reason to think my of onions not entire y unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies a when i wrote that letter a replied darch d i believed myself perfectly calm and cool 3 but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit 
the letter perhaps began in bitterest 
but it did not end so 
the adieu is charity itself 
but think no more of the letter 
the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten 
you must learn some of my philosophy 
— think only of the past as its remembrance gives you leisure d i can not give you credit for any his can by of the kind 
tour retroapectione must be so totally void of re coach that the contentment arising from them is not philosophy but what is much better of ignorance 
but with me it in not so 
painful recollections will inside which can not which ought not to be repelled 
i have been a search being all my life in practice though not in principle 
as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper 
i wan given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit 
unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoiled by my parents who though themselves in father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overtaking 
to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rent of the world to warm at least to 1890 pride and prejudice 
think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own 
such i was from eight to eight-andtwenty 
and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth 10 what do i not owe you 
you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous 
by you i was properly rumbled 
i came to you without a double my reception 
you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased 2 
had you then persuaded yourself that i should i 
a indeed i had 
what will you think of my vanity 
i believed you to he wishing expecting my addresses 2 my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you 
i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong 
how you must have hated me after last evening i d a hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction 
i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at temperly 
you blamed me for coming 
a d no indeed i felt nothing but surprise 
your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you 
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due 
a my object within a replied dairy was to show you by every civility in my power that was not no mean as to resent the past 
and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill-opinion by letting ou see that your reproofs had been attended to 
ow soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half hour after i had seen you he then told her of georgia delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden pride and prejudice

interruption 
which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon left that his resolution of following her from deer share in quest of her sister had been formed before e quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend 
she expressed her gratitude again 
but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther 
after waking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know anything about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home 
what could become of mr hindley and jane 
2 was a wonder which introduced the discussion of baker affairs 
fancy was delighted with their engagement 
his friend had given him the earliest information of it 
i must ask whether you were surprised 
a mid elizabeth 
d not at all 
when i went away i felt that it would soon happen 2 that is to say you had given your permission 
i guessed as much and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case 
a on the evening before my going to london d said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago 
told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent 
his surprise was great 
he had never had the slightest suspicion 
i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him 
and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together 19 andrew wwuﬁﬁxﬂmm areas-gum “dhfpkﬁnywmdnv-iq”dl daze “vhayumﬂhdn-yilnludli-.¢ mdyﬁu-yhilnhhﬁ

a y dear dizzy where can you have been walking to 
2 was e question which elizabeth received from jane is soon at she entered the more and from all the others when they us down to table 
she had only to lay in reply that had wandered about till he was beyond her own knowledge 
she coloured a she spoke 
but neither that nor anything else awakened a suspicion of the truth 
the evening w quietly marked by anything extraordinary 
he know edged lovers talked and laughed 
the acknowledged were silent 
day was not of a dim tone in which ha pines overshoe in mirth 
and gim agitated and consented rather new that shown ha y than it herself to be no 
for bedded the in late embarrassment there were other evil before her 
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known 
the win aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the other it was a roar which not all his fortune and consequence might do away 
at night she opened her heart to jane 
oh corn was very far from miss bonnets general habits she was absolutely incredulous here 
b you are joking dizzy 
this can not be 
— engaged to mr l l 
no no you shall not deceive me 
i know it to impossible this is a wretched beginning indeed my role d defence was on you 
and i am sure nobody else wi i believe me if you do not 
yet indeed i am in earnest 
i speak nothing but the truth 
he still loves me and we are engaged 
a jane looked at her doubtingly 
oh dizzy 
it can not be 
i know how much you dislike him ii 
n 104 pride and prejudicial b you know nothing of the matter 
am ll all to be forgot 
perhaps i did not alwaylove him to well at i do now 
ut in such can at these 31 good memory is pardonable 
this it the la time i shall ever remember it myself minx bonnet still looked all amazement 
elizabeth again and more curiously ensured her of in truth 
good heaven 
can it be really to 
yet now i must believe you cried jane 
a my dear dear dizzy i would 
i do congratulate you 
but are you certain 
forgive the question 
are you quite certain that you can be in play with him 
10th can be no doubt of that 
it in nettled between us already that we are to be the ha plied couple in the world 
but are you pleased angel shall on like to have such a brother 
d a cry very much 
nothing could give either bigotry or myself more delight 
but we considered it we talked of it at impossible 
and do you really love him quite well enough 
oh dizzy 
do anything rather than marry without infection 
are you quite lure that you feel what you ought to do 
a 
oh yet 
you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all 
what do you mean 
a why i must coal that i love him better than i do hindley 
i am afraid you will be angry 
a my dearest sister now be be curious 
i want to talk very seriously 
let me know everything that i am to know without delay 
will you tell me how long you have loved him 
a it has been coming on to gradually that i hardly know when it began 
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful ground at pemberley.” another entreaty that the would be serious however pride and prejudice 
10th produced the desired died and the noon instilled jane y her nobleman mallam of attachment 
when connncedhon that article minx bonnet had nothing further to win 
a now i am quite ha y a said the for you will be a h m myself 
always had a value for him 
were it r nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him 
but now a bingley’l friend and your husband there can he only tingled and yourself more dens to me 
but izzy you have been very lay very received with me 
how little did you tell me of what poured it temperly and lamhtonl i owe all that i know of it to another not to you 
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy 
she had been unwilling to mention bringing 
and the united m of her own feeling 
had made her rally avoid the name of his friend 
but now the way d no longer conceal from her his share in dial marriage 
all we acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation 
a good gracious 2 cried my bonnet an the stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable mr diary in not coming here again with our dear hindley what can he mean by being so tiresomely ll to be always coming here 
i had no moon but he would go hooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company 
what shall we do with him 
izzy you most walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley’a wax 10 elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet we 
really vexed that her mother should be always giving him inch in epithet 
as noon at they entered hindley looked at her no expressive and shook hand with such warmth at left no doubt of good information 
and he noon after l 9 pride and prejudice 
warded laid aloud mr bonnet have you no more lane humbug in which dizzy may lose her way again to-day 
d i advise mr dairy and dizzy and fifty 2 laid my bonnet c to walk to oaken mount thin morning 
it in a nice long walk and mr darch hat never seen the view 
a it may do very well for the other 
led mr hindley 
a but i am cure it will be too much r ditty 
wo n't it kith 
fifty ownedvthat the had rather my at home 
fancy rafted a rent curiosity to see the view from the aunt and elizabeth silently consented 
all the went upstairs to get ready my bonnet followed her saying a i am quite tarry dizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself 
but i hope you will not mind it it in all for jane take you know 
and there in no occasion for talking to him except just now and then 
so do not put yourself to inconvenience during their walk it was resolved that mr bonneted content should be asked in the corner of the evening 
elizabeth reserved to herself the a london for her mother 
she could not determine w her mother would take it 
sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man 
but whether she were violently act gum the match or violently delighted with it 
it wan certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her acute 
and the cauldron more bear that mr darch should hear the fire rapture of her joy than the sum vehemence of her diuppmhotion 
in the evening soon after mr bonnet withdrew to the library the saw mr darch rice also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it wan extreme 
she hams and prejudice 
19 did not fear her father opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that do his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be telling him with fear regrets in dispose of her was a wretched reflection and she eat in misery till mr dane a red again when looking at him she was a little removed by his mile 
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with knitted and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper a go to your father 
he wants you in the library she was gone directly 
her father wan walking about the room looking grave and anxious 
a lazy d said he a what are you doing 
are you out of your senses to be accepting thin man 
have not you always hated him go how earnestly did the then wish that her former union had been more reasonable her expression more moderate 
it would have spared her from explanations and pmfeseiooo which it was exceedingly awkward to give 
but they were now necessary and ohe assured him with some conclusion of her alec meant to mr darch 
or in other words you are determined to have him 
he is rich to be sure and you may have more one clothes and one carriage 
than jane 
but will they make on happy 1/2 find you any other objection d said elizabeth a than your belief of my index fence 
a none at all 
we all know him to be a proud unpleasant son of man 
but this would be nothing if you really liked him 
d i do i do like him he replied with tears in her s 
d i love him 
indeed he has no improper pride 
e in perfectly amiable 
you do not know what he really in 
then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such termed a izz said her father a i have given him my 18 sums and snow consent 
he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse anything which he condescend to ask 
i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him 
but let me advise you to think better of it 
i know your disposition dizzy 
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband 
unless you looked up to him as a superior 
your lively talents would place ou in the greatest danger in an unequal mania e on could scarcely escape discredit and misery 
y child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life 
you know not what you are about 
elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply 
and at length by repeated assurances that mr dairy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimate of him mad undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enervating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her father s incredulity and reconcile him to the match 
a well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say 
if this be the case he deserves you 
i could not have parted with you my izz to any one less worthy 
to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr dairy had voluntarily done for indian 
he heard her with astonishment 
this is an evening of wonders indeed 
and so dearly did everything 
made up the match gave the money paid the fellow s debts and got him his commission so much the better 
it will save me 3 world of trouble and economy 
had it been your uncle doing i must and would have paid him 
but these violent sung lovers carry everything their own way 
i shall offer to pay him to-morrow he will pride and prejudice 
149 not and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading mr colling letter 
and after laughing at her sometime allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room 
if any young men come for mary or fifty send them in for i am quite at leisure elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half-an-hour s quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure 
everything was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away 
there was no longer anything material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time 
when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night she followed her and made the important communication 
its effect was most extraordinary 
for on first hearing it mrs bonnet not quite still and unable to utter a syllable 
nor was it under many man minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them 
she began at length to recover to get about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself 
good serious 
lord bless me 
only think 
dear me 
r darch 
who would have thought it and is it really true 
oh my sweetest dizzy 
how rich and how great you will be 
what prize-money what jewels what carriages you will have 
jones is nothing to it 
nothing at all 
i am so pleased 
so ha pry 
such a charming mania 
so handsome 
so mill 
oh my dear dizzy 
pray apologise for lady having disliked him so much before 
i hope he will overlook it 
dear dear dizzy 
a house in town 
everything that is charming 
three daughters 200 pride and prejudice 
married 
ten than a year 
oh lord 
what will become of me 
i shall go distracted this was enough to save that her approbation need not be doubted 
and elizabeth rejoicing that such an illusion was heard only by herself soon went away 
but before the had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her 
my dearest child ellen cried i can think of nothing else 
ten thousand a year and very likely more 
this as good as a lord 
and a special license 
you must and shall be named by a special license 
but 
my dearest love tell me what dish mr fancy is particularly fond of that i may have it to-morrow this was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be 
and elizabeth found that though in the certain impression of his warmest affection 
and secure of her relations consent they was will something to be wished for 
but the marrow passed of much better than she expected 
for mrs bonnet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion 
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him 
and mr bonnet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem 
i admire all my sons-in-law highly d said he 
“wicitham perhaps is my favourite 
but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane’s.” pride and prejudice 
1801 chapter 10 
elizabeth s rifts soon rising to playfulness again she wan mr dared to account for his having ever fallen in love with her 
a how could you begin 
said she 
i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once mule a beginning 
but what could set you of 
in the first place i d i can not ax on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation 
it is too in ago 
i was in the middle before i knew that i he un 
y beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners 
my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you n than not 
now be sincere 
did you admire me or my impatience 
a for the loveliness of your mind i did 
b you ma as well call it impertinence at once 
it was very little e loss 
the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of delicious attention 
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your a relation alone 
i roused and interested you because was no unlike item 
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it 
but in s it of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just 
and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you 
there 
i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it 
and really all thin i considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable 
o be sure us know no actual good of me 
but nobody thinks olytba when they fall in love 250 pride and prejudice 
2 was there no good in ur affectionate behaviour to jane while the was ill at ethereal 
a dearest jane 
who could have done less for her 
but make a virtue of it by all means 
my good qualities are under your protection and on are to exaggerate them as much as possible 
an in return it belongs to me to and occasions for teasing and arresting with you as often as may be 
and shall n directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last 
what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here 
why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me 2 2 because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement 2 but i was embarrassed 
and so was i 
b you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner 
a man who had felt less might 
how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it 
but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself 
i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to india had certainly great effect 
tea meet i am afraid 
for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise 
for i ought not to have mentioned the subject 
this will never do b you need not distress yourself 
the moral will be perfectly fair 
lady catherine's unjustiﬁable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts 
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude 
i was not in 31 humour to wait for an opening of yours 
my aunt hale and pure dice 
1801 intelligence had given me hope and l was determined at once to know everything 
lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her ha pay for she loves to be of use 
but tell me 
what did you come down to tethered for 
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed 
or had you intended any more serious confuse fences 
a real uz westhouse ou andto'ude if could am ever hooper make you have me 
my avowed one or what i avowed to m self was to see whether your sister was still rival to hindley and if she were so make the corn simon to him which i have since made 
a shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine whet is to befall her p 
d i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth 
but it out t to he done 
and if on will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done direct 10 c and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the cleverness of your writing as 10 another young lad once did 
but have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr dairy had been overjoyed elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardener long letter but now having box 
to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to and that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows 
— a i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ou hit to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particular 
but to say the truth i was too cross to write 
you supposed more than really existed 
but new suppose as much as you chase 
give a loose 104 pride and prejudice 
to your fancy indulge our imagination in eve sickle light which the subject will afford and unlgsypo believe me actually married you can not greatly en 
you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last 
i thank on again and again for not going to the lakes 
ow could i be so silly as to wish it 
your idea of the ponies is delightful 
we will go round the park every day 
i am the happiest creature in the world 
perhaps other peor les have said so before but no one with such justice 
am happier even than jane 
she only smiles laugh 
mr dare sends you all the low in the world that can be spared from me 
you are all to come a temperly at christmas 
yours e 
mr. darch letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr bonnet sent to mr calling in reply to his last 
fades six 
31 must trouble you once more for congratulation 
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr darch 
console lady catherine as well as you can 
but if i were you i would stand by the nephew 
he has more to give 
yours sincerely 
arc miss hindley's congratulation to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and sincere 
she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard 
jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved 
the joy which miss darch expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brothers in pride and prejudice 
25 tending it 
four ridges of paper were inmlﬁcient to contain ell her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister 
before any answer could arrive from mr colling or any congratulation to elizabeth from his wife the leghorn family heard that the confines were come herself to lucy lodge 
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident 
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the content of her nephew s letter that marlott really rejoicing in the much was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over 
at such a moment the arrival of her friend won a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the comic of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr darch exposed to all the king and obsequiously civility of her husband 
he re it however with admirable calmness 
he could even listen to sir william lucy when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest eels of the country and expressed his hopes of their l meeting frequently at st jeweled with very decent composure 
if he did hung his shoulders at was not till sir william was out of sight 
mrs pips s vulgar was mother and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance 
and though my home as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which hindley's good humour encouraged yet whenever she j speak she must be vulgar 
nor was her t for him though it made her more quiet at all like y to make her more elegant 
elizabeth did ill she could to shield him from the rent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without modification f and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from ill this took from the moon of courtship much of its pleasure it 226 mum and nerves 
added to the ho of the future 
and ohe looked forward with delight t to the time when they should be removed from society no little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at temperly 
calm 10 
apply for all her maternal feeling i was the day 
on which my bonnet not rid of her two root deserving daughters 
it what delighted pride she oﬂerwardu visible mim hindley and talked of my diary may be guessed 
i with i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the urabliahment of so many of her children produced it ha y an effect ill to make her a sensible amiable welling armed woman for the rest of her life
