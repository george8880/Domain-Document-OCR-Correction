t is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife 
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well bred in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered an the frightful property of come one or other of their daughters 
me dear mr bonnet said his lady to him one day 
have you heard that netherﬁeld park is let at 18 
mr bonnet replied that he had not 
a but it is a hemmed she 
for mrs long has been here and she told me all about it 
mr bonnet made no newer

a cried his 
while impatiently 
stay want to tell me and have no objection to hearing it 
this wan invitation enough 
why my dear you must know mrs long by that netherﬁeld is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of envy and 
that he came i pride and prejudice 
down on monday in a chatter and four to see the place and was to much delighted with it

that he it to take position before michaelmas and some of hit servant are to be in the home by the end of next week

you must know that i am thinking of hit marrying one of them a it that his design in settling here 
a sign 
nonsense how can you talk to 
but 
it ll very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him at noon at he come i see no occasion for that 
you and the girl may go or you may tend them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are at hand at any of them mr singly might like you the best of the pony a my dear you after me 
i certainly but had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now 
when a woman has ever grown-up daughters the ought to give over thinking of her own beauty -5 a a touch cares 
a woman hat not often much beauty to think of a but my dear you must indeed go and to mr kindly when he come into the neighbourhood 1 it it more than i engage for i nature you a but consider your daughter 
only think what on embellishment it would be for one of them 
sir pride and prejudice 
3 william and lady case are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no newcomers 
indeed you must go for it will be impossible for w to visit him you do not you are over-scrupulous surely 
i dare say mr single will beveryglad lose you 
and will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chuses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little line -5 a desire you will do no such thin 
likely is not a bit better than the others 
nndnlsam sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so goodhumoured s die but you are always giving the preference they have none of them much to recommend them a replied he 
they are all silly and ignorant like other girls 
but life has something more of quickness than her sister mrs bent how can you abuse your own children in such a way 
you take delight in being me 
you have no compassion on my poor nerves a you mistake me my dear 
i have a high t for your nerves 
they are my old friends

it is very unlucky

how good it wan in you my dear mr bonnet but i knew i should

7 chapter 33 
at all that mrs baronet however with the animals of her live daughters could ask on the subject war sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr singly 
they attacked him in various ways 
with bare-faced questioner ingenious nut portion and distant mrmiaeo 
but he eluded the of them all and the were at lute obliged to alice t the second-hand into silence of their neighbour l lucy 
her report was highly favourable 
sir will am had been delighted with him 
he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party 
nothing could be more delightful 
to be fond of dancing wan a certain ate toward falling in love 
and very lively hopes of 5 bingley’l heart were entertained 
if i can but see one of my daughters ha pity settled at netherﬁel 
mind mrs bonnet to her but d a and all the other equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for 
in a few days mr singly returned mr bonnets visit and cast about ten minutes with him in full liberal 
he entertained hopes of being admitted to a leg of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much 
but he saw only the father 
the indies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of remaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse 
an invitation to dinner wan noon afterwards die 
pitched 
and already had mrs bonnet planned the sonnet that were to do credit to her house in when an answer arrived which deferred it all 
mr singly wan obliged to be in town the following day and come pump and prejudice 
frequently unable to accept the honour of 
their invitation act 
my bonnet wan quite disconcerted 
she could not imagine what business he could have in town on noon after his arrival in herefordshire 
and she began to fear that he might be away saying about from one place to another and never settled at netherﬁeld as he ought to be 
lad lucy quieted her fear a little by staring the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large part for the ball 5 and a report noon followed that mr being by wan to bring twelve ladies and even gentlemen with him to the assembly 
the girl grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only ix with him from london 
think over letters and a cousin 
and when the party entered the next room it consisted only of over all together 
mr singly his two avert the husband of the elder and another young man 
mr singly was good-looking and gentlemanlike 
he had a pleasant countenance and only unaffected manners 
his master were fine women with an air of decided fashion 
his brothers 
law mr hunt merely looked the gentleman 
but his friend mr dairy noon drew the attention of the room by bit line tall person handsome features noble men and the report which wall in general circulating within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a-year 
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a line figure of a man the ladies declared be war much handsomer than mr bigger and he wan looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manner gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity 
for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being placed 
and not all hit large came in derbylhire could then have him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with hit friend 
pride and prejudice 
9 mr singly had soon made himself acquainted with all the prize people in the room 
he was lively and preserved need every dance was angry that the ball closed an early and talked of loving one himself at netherlield 
such amiable s duties must speak for themselves 
what a contrast between him and his friend 
mr dairy danced only once with mrs hunt and once with miss singly declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room king occasionally to one of his own party 
his trust was decided 
he was the loudest moor disagreeable man in the world and even my hoped that he would never come there a akin 
amongst the most violent against him was mrs sonnet whose dislike of his general behaviour was hardened into clear resentment by his having blighted one of her daughters 
elizabeth bonnet had been obliged by the capacity of gentlemen to sit down for two races 
and during part of that time mr dairy had been lending near noon he for her to overhear s conversation between him and 5 singly who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it 
come day said he i must have you dance 
i hate to see you mending about by yourself in thin stupid manner 
you had much the dance 
i certainly shall not 
you know how i deny it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner 
at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable 
your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with i would not be so fastidious as you are cried single a for a kingdom 
upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have i 
b c 
pride and prejudice 
this evening 
and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty 
stay are advancing with the only handsome girl in the room a said mercy looking at the eldest miss bonnet 
oh 
the is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld 
but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable 
do let me ask my partner to introduce a 
a which do you mean 
2 and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said a she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt m and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to urge ladies who are slighted by other men 
you had utter return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me 
mr singly followed his advice 
mr dairy walked off 
and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him 
she told the story however with great writ among her friends 
for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in anything ﬁdlilc‘mou“ 3 et passed if l till the he evening to her of easy to whole family 
mrs yet had seen beg eldest daughter much admired by the nethcrﬁeld party 
mr singly had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters 
jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way 
elizabeth felt jane's leisure 
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss angry as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood 
and catherine and ladies had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball 
they returned therefore in good spirits to longpride and prejudice l 
born the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants 
they found mr bonnet still up 
with a book he was regardless of time 
and on the resent occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to event of an evening which had raised luck insipid expccmiona 
he had rather hoped that all hit wife views on the stranger would be disappointed 
but he soon found thathehadaverydiﬁerent itorytohear 
oh 
my dear mr bonnet as she entered the room 2 we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent hall 
i wish you had been there 
jane was so admired nothing could he like it 
everybody said how well she looked 
and mr single thought her utter beautiful and danced with her twice 
only wink of but my dear 
he actually danced with her twice 
and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time 
first of all he asked miss lucy 
i wusovexedtoseehim stand up with her 
but 
however he did not admire her at all 
indeed nobody can you know 
and he seemed quite struck with one as the was going down the dance 
50 he inquired who she was and got introduced and asked her or the two next 
then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lungs and the two path with jane again 
and the two sixth with life and the boulanger.” 1 if he had had any compassion for use cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much for god s sake say no more of his partners 
of that he had spurned his ankle in the list dance i a job 
my dear continued mrs bonnet i am quite delighted with him 
he is so excessively handsome 
and his sisters are charming women 
i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses 
i dare lay the lace upon mrs hunt s gown 
— a 2 pride and prejudice here the wet interrupted again 
mr bonnet protested against my description of every 
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the object and related with much bitterness of it and tom exit relation the shocking merest of 5 dairy 
a t i can more you the added that size does not lute much by not waiting infancy 
for he it a most disagreeable horrid man not it all worth pleading 
so higlhlnnd to conceited that there went no enduring him 
he walked here and he walked there fancying himself to very great 
not handsomer enough to dance with 
i with you had been there m dear to have given him one of your tet-downt 
quite detected the man 
tbtpttt 37 
hen june and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautiously in her pain of mr singly before expected to her bitter how very much the admired him 
he it what a young men ought to be a said the table 
good-humoured lively 
and i never in 
such hat pry manner 
to much eat with such perfect good-breeding a a he it to handsome a replied elizabeth 
which i young man ought likewise to be if he putting can 
hit character it thereby complete i was very much altered by his asking me to dance a second time 
i did not expect such a compliment did not you 
i did for you 
but that it one great difference between it 
come lament always take you by surprise and me never 
hat could be more pride and prejudice 
3 natural than his asking you again 
he could not help seeing that you were about ever times a pretty as every 1 other woman in the room 
no thank his for that 
well he certainly is very agreeable and give you leave to like him 
you have liked many a stupid person 
a dear likely i a 
oh 
you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general 
you never see a fault in anybody 
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes 
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life i would wish not to be busy in enduring any one 
but i always speak what i think 
i know you do 
and it in that which makes the wonder 
with joy good sense to be no honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candour in common enough 
one meet it even here 
but to be candid without animation or i m 
to take the good of everybody's character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone 
and so you like this manner sisters too do you 
their manner are not equal to his 
a certainly no 
at lit 
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them 
mine mingle in to live with her brother and keep his house 
and i am much mistaken if we shall not and a very charming next hour in her 
elizabeth listen in silence but was not convinced 
their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general 
and with more quickness of observation and less privacy of temper than her sister and with i judgment too assailed by any attention to herself the was very little disposed to approve them 
they were in fact very fine ladies 
not 14 pride and prejudice deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable when they chose it but mud and conceited 
they were rather handsome lived been educated in one of the list private ieminnriee in town had a fortune of twenty dined pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others 
they were of a respectable family in the north of england 
a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been at fired by trade 
mr singly inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it 
mr medley intended it likewise 
and sometime made choice of his county 
but at he was now provided with a old house and the liberty of i manor 
it was doubt us to man of those who best knew the confines of his temper w either he might not opened the remainder of hit day i at nedierﬁeld and leave the next generation to pure need 
his 
linen were very anxious or hit having an fate of his own 
but though he was now established on as a tenant nice singly wan by no mean unwilling to preside at his table 
nor was mr hum who had married a man of more fashion than fortune lieu disposed to consider his house at her home when it united her 
mr singly had not been of age two years when he was ten red b an accidental recommendation to look at the old house 
he did look at it and into it for half 
hour 
was pleased with the situation and the principal room fatigued with what the owner said in in price and took it immediately 
a pride and prejudice 15 between him and day there was a ve steady friendship in spite of great a tone of c cetera 
mingled wandered to carry the cabinet opened and activity of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appealed dissatisfied 
on the strength of darcy’i regard singly had the neck reliance and of he judgment the higher on none 
in understanding dairy was the superior 
mingled was by no means deficient but dared wan clever 
he was at the came time haughty renewed 
and insidious and his manners though we bed were not inviting 
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage 
mingled viii sure of being liked wherever he appeared dry was continually giving offence 
the manner in which they spoke of the mention assembly was sufficiently characteristic 
mingled had never met witadplemnter people or prettier girl in hit life 
every had been most kind and attentive to him 
there he been no formality no etilfneea 
he had soon felt acquainted with all the room 
and as to miss bonnet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful 
mercy on the contrary had been a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no father for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or plenum-e. miss bonnet he acknowledged to be pretty but the smiled too much 
or 
hunt and her sister allowed it to be a 
but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of 
miss bonnet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by inch commendation to think of her as he chose 
16 pride and prejudice 
character he 
thin 3 than walk of longtown lived a family with whom the bonnet were particularly intimate 
sir william lucy had been formerly in trade in barton where he had made a tolerable fortune and him to the honour of king stood by an address to the king during his more my 
the distinction had perhaps been felt too angry 
it had given him a doubt to his business and to his residence in a small market town 
and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a book about a mile from morton predominated from that period lucy lodge where he could think with pleasure of hit own importance and unchecked by busiest occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world 
for though elated by his 
rank it did not render him mpercilioua 
on the contrary he were all attention to everybody 
by nature offensive friendly and obliging hire presentation at st. james had made him courteous 
lady case was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be i valuable next hour to my bonnet 
the had several children 
a eldest of them a series lee intelligent young woman about twenty-seven wan elizabeth intimate friend 
that the main lucaaee and the mine bonnet did meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary 
and the morning after the enemy brought the former to longtown to hear and to communicate 
a tap began the evening well charlotte laid bonnet with civil self-command to miss lucy 
a thou were mr bingluy’a 1st choice 1 yet 
but he seemed to like his second letter a oh 
you mean jane i suppose because he danced pride and prejudice 
in withhertwice 
tobesurcthatﬂdseemasifhe admired her 
indeed i rather believe he rid 
i heard something about it 
but i hardly know what 
something about mr robinson 
perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson 
did not i mention it to you 
mr robinson's asking him how he liked our morton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and whirl he thought the prettiest 
and his answering immediately to the last question 
oh 
the eldest miss bonnet beyond doubt 
there can not be two opinions on that pain upon my word 
well that was very decided indeed 
that does seem as if 
— 
but however it may all come to nothing you know 
a my overhearing were more to the purpose than you eliza a said charlotte 
mr mercy is not no well worth listening to as his friend is he i 
poor eliza 
— 
to be only use tolerable 
i beg you would not put it into lizzy’s head to be vexed by his ill-treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him 
mrs long told me last night that he not close to her for half-hour without once opening his lips 
are you note sure modern l 
— in not there a little mistake 
a said jane 
i certainly saw mr fancy no to her 
may 
because she asked him at last how he liked netherﬁeld and he could not help lowering her 
but the said he seemed very angry at being spoke to a mile singly told me a card jane 
that he never want 
much 
unless among his intimate acquaintance 
the lamp he in remarkably agreeable 
i do not believe a word of it my dear 
if he 18 pride and prejudice 
had been so very agreeable he would have talked to my long 
but i can guess how it won 
everybody lays that he ll eat up with pride and i dare lay he had heard somehow that mr long does not keep ear 
rage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise 
i do not mind his not talking to men on a laid mine faces but i with he had danced with library another time lazy aid her mother i would not dance with lain if i were you 
i believe ma'am i may safer promise you never to dance with him 
a his pride a aid mix lucy does not offend no it much an pride often doer became there in an excuse for it 
one can not wonder that so very one a young man with family fortune everything in hit favour should think highly of himself 
if my 10 express it he has a right 
to be proud 
that in very true 1 replied elizabeth 
and i could easily forgive bit pride if he had not noticed my 
a pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflection 2 is a very common failing i believe 
by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it in very common indeed 
that human nature ll particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or the other xl or imaginary 
vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used iy'nouymounl 
a person may be proud without being vain 
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us 
if i were as rich at mr fancy a cried 1 young lucaarwho came with his sisters 1 i should not care how proud i wan 
i would keep a pack of fox-hounds and drink a bottle of wine every day pride and prejudice 
it then you would drink a great deal more than you on hetty said mrs bonnet 
and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly the boy protested that she should not 
the con 
tired to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit 
hum he 
he ladies of longtown soon waited on those of netherﬁeld 
the visit was refuted in due form 
miss bonnets pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of mrs burst and miss singly 
and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger steps not worth speaking to a with of being her acquainted with than was expressed towards the two eldest 
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure 
but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them 
laugh their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother admiration 
it was generally evident whenever they met that he ll admire her 
and to bear it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the reference which she had begun to entertain for him am the first and was in a way to be very much in love 
but she considered with up ensure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great 
strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent 
she mention this to her friend miss lucy 
it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte 20 pride and prejudice 
to be able to impose on the public in such a clue 
but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded 
if a woman conceal her affection with the same skill from the object of it the may lose the opportunity of bring him 
and it will then be but 5 consolation to believe the world equally in the it 
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to himself we can all begin freely 
a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have hurt you he to be really in love without encouragement 
in one cases out of ten a woman had better show an affection than she feels 
mingled likes our sister undoubtedly 
but he may never do more an like her if she does not help him once but she does help him on as much an her name will allow 
if i can receive her regard for him he must be a simpleton in need not to discover it too 
remember eliza that he does not know jane disposition at you do but if a woman in partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must and it out 
perhaps a he must if he seen enough of her 
but though bigger and jane meet tolerably often it in never for many hours together 
and an they always 5 see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conveying either 
jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention 
when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love ll much as she chooses 
your plan is a good one a replied elizabeth a where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married 
and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it 
but these are not jane's feeling 
she is not acting by pride and prejudice 2 
design 
as yet she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness 
she has known him on a fortnight 
she danced four dances with him at eton 
she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times 
this is not quite enough he to make her understand his character 1 at as you represent it 
had she merely end with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite 
but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together 
and four evenings may do a great deal 
yes 
these four evening s have enabled them to certain that they both like ingt-un better than commerce 
but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not may be that much has been unfolded 
a well said chair utter a i wish jane success with all my heart 
and if she were married to him to-morrow i should think she had as good s chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for s twelvemonth 
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance 
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or over so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the least 
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation 
and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life a you make me laugh charlotte 
but it is not sound

and in of him asserting that her manner were notched of the fashionable world he was caught by their ears playfulness 
of thin the war perfectly unawares 
— to her he won only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with 
he began to with to know more of her and up a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with other

a you are a very strange creature by way of a friend 
— always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody 
if my vanity had taken a musical turn out would have been invaluable 
but a it it i won

her performance was playing though by no means capital 
after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded it the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for my

and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and rich airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the luckiest and two or three 24 pride and prejudice

i consider it as one of the hat refinement of polished societiee.” 1 certainly sir

a you saw me once at mercy believe sir 
yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the night 
do you often dance at st james 
a a never tire a do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place i 
it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it 
a you have a house in town i conclude 
a mr dairy bowed 
i had once some thoughts of king in town myself 
for i an fond of superior society 
but i did not feel quite certain that the air of low on would agree with a local 
he wanted in hopes of an answer 
but his companion was not disposed to make any 
and elizabeth at that infant moving toward them he was struck with the pride and prejudice 
25 notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her 
a my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing 
— mr dare you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner 
you can not refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty in before you 
and taking her hand he would have given it to mr day who though extremely surprized was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and laid with some discomposure to sir william 
a indeed

i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way order to be'ghfor a partner

elizabeth was determined 
nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion 
a you excel so much in the dance in eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you 
and though thin gentleman disliked the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half-hour a mr fancy it all politeness said elizabeth smiling 
a he is indeed 
but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we can not wonder at his complaisance 
for who would object to such a partner 
a elizabeth looked archly and turned away 
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with name complacency when thus accosted by miss singly 
i can use the subject of your reverie a i should d may be not a you are considering how insupportable it would be tel-fans many evenings in this manner

i have been meditating on the very great up came which a pair of line eyed the face of a pretty woman can hectow.” mine singly immediately vexed her eye on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections 
mr dairy replied with great in pity 
a mile macbeth bonnet

i am all astonishment 
how long has she been such a favourite

5 bonnet s property consisted almost entirely in an curate of two thousand years which unfortunately for his daughters war entangled in fault of heirs male on a distant relation 
pride and prejudice 
27 and their mothers fortune thou he ample for her situation in life could but ill nipped v the mercy of his 
her father had been an attorney in eton and had left her four thousand pounds 
shehadasisterman-ied to a mr philip who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade 
the village of longtown was only one mile from morton 
a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a millinery shop 1st over the way 
the two youngest of the family hearing and ladies were particularly frequent in these attentions 
their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to mention was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening 
and however bare of news the country in her might be they always contrived to learn some worn their aunt at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood 
it as to remain the whole winter and morton was the hind-quarter 
their visits to mrs lips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence 
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections 
their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves 
mr philip visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before 
they could talk of nothing but others 
and mr singly 3 large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regiment of an insight 
28 pride and prejudice 
after listening one morning to their allusion on this subject mr bonnet coolly observed 
from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silent girls in the country 
i have expected it some time but i am now convinced 
catherine was discovered and made no answer 
but die with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of ca train career and her hope of seeing him in the course of 
the day a he was going the next morning to london 
a i am astonished my dear a said mrs bonnet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly 
if i wished to think slightingly of anybody s children it should not of my own however 
a if in children are silly 
i must hope to be always sensible of its eyes 
but no it happens they are all of them very clever 
a this is the only point i better myself on which we do not agree 
i had hoped city our sentiments conceived in every particular but i must to far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughter uncommonly foolish 
my dear mr bonnet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother 
when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do 
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well 
and indeed so i do still at my heart 
and if a smart young colonel with live or six thousand a-year should want one of my girl i shall not say nay to him 
and i thought colonel forswear looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his regiment 
a mamma cried lying a my aunt says that colonel faster and captain canter do not go so often to miss pride and prejudice 
it waggons as they did when they worst came 
she sees them now very often standing in charles library 
my bonnet was prevented 5 l in by the entrance of the footman with a note for 11 bonnet 
it came from netherﬁeld and the servant waited for an newer 
my bennct’u eyes rpnrklcd with pleasure and she wm gale 
calling out while her daughter read 
— a well jane who is it from 
what is it about 
what does he say 
well jane make haste and tell us make hate my love a it in from miss single a said jane and then read it aloud 
a my tom fairer 
a if you are not no compassionate an to dine to-day with louisa and me we shall he in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole days tilt-540 between two women can never end without a quarrel 
come as won as you can on the receipt of this 
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the office 
your ever chance bunost.” 1 with the others a cried india 
i wonder my aunt did not tell us of low 
a dining out a said mrs bonnet 2 that is very unlucky a can i have the carriage 
a said jane 
a no my dear out had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain 
and then you must stay all i hit 
a hat would be a good scheme a said elizabeth a if you were sure that they would not over to send her home 
a oh 
but the enemies will have mr dingley’a chaise to go to eton 
and the hunt have no one to theirs 1 i had much rather go in the coach 30 pride and prejudice 
room dear further can not the horse i am sure 
they are wanted in the farm mr bonnet are not they 
“theyarewantedin the fannmmhoﬁeoerthanl can t am 
a at if you have got them to-day 1 aid elizabeth a my other purposes will be answered 
he did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged 
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful yrognoeticof a bad day 
her however answered 
jane had not been gone long before it rained hard 
her listen were weary for her but her mother woe delighted 
the rain 
continued the whole evening without intermission 
june certainly could not come back 
this wan a lucky idea of mine indeed l a mind my bonnet more than once a if the credit of making it rain were all her own 
till the next morning however the wan not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance 
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherﬁeld brought the following note for elizabeth 
my utter lazy 
i and myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be i used to my getting wet through yesterday 
my kind friend will not hear of my return home till i am better 
they insisted also on my seeing mr jonek-therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me 
and excepting a sore-throat and headache there in not much the matter with me 
— your etc. a well my dear a said mr bonnet 
when elizabeth had read the note aloud 1 if your daughter should have a dangerous lit of illness 
if the should die it would be pride and prejudice 
31 a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr beings and under your order 
oh 
i am not at all afraid of her drink 
people do not die of little trying colds 
she will be taken good care of 
as long as she tea i there it is all very well 
i would go and see her if could have the carriage can elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had 
and as she was no horsewoman walking was her only alternative 
she declared her resolution 
a how can you be so silly cried her mother a as to think of such a thing in all this dirt 
you will not be lit to be seen when on get there 
i shall be very t to see jane 
which is all i want 
2 is this a hint to me lay said her father a to send for the horses 
a a no indeed 
i do not wish to avoid the walk 
the distance is nothing when one has a motive 
only three miles 
i shall be back by dinner a i admire the activity of your benevolence 1 observed mary 1 but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason 
and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what ll required 2 we will go as far as merry with you a said catherine and ladies 
elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set of together 
if we make haste a said die as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain canter more he goes 
in me ton they 
the two youngest red to the lodgings ofpbiiidof the officers wivleesfmand elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after old at a quick pace jumping over smiles and springing over puddle with impatient activity and ending herself 32 pride and splendid 
at within view of the home with weary uncles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise 
she wan shown into the breakfahyarlour where all but jane were tumbled and where her appearance created i great deal of surprise 
that the should have walked three miles to early in the day in such dirty weather and herself was almost incredible to my hunt and in angry 
and elizabeth wan convinced that they held her in contempt for it 
she was received however very politely by them 
and in their brother manners there was something better than limes 
there wan good humour and kindness 
mr s laid very little and mr hunt nothing at all 
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt a. to the occasion justifying her coming to far alone 
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast 
her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered 
mist bonnet had slept ill and though up wan very feverish and not well enough to leave her room 
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately 
and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from examining in her note how much the longed for much a visit was delighted at her entrance 
she war not a however to much conversation and when mind singly left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness the was treated with 
elizabeth silently attended her 
when breakfast wan over they were joined by the listen 
and elizabeth began to like them herself when she now how much action and solitude they showed for jane 
the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to most sun summer 
33 get the better of it 
advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts 
the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely 
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentleman being out they had in fact nothing to do a severe 
when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that the must go and very unwillingly said so 
miss singly offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testify red such concern in parting with her that miss singly was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present 
elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longtown to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes 
chapter 1791 
t live o'clock the two ladies retired to dress and it half-past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner 
to the civil inquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingley’s she could not make a very favourable answer 
jane was by no means better 
the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much the were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad no d and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves 
and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards june when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike 
34 pride and noble theirbrother indeed mstheonlyoneofthepnrty whom she could regard with my complacency 
his next for jane was evident and in 
attention 
to herself most pleasing 
and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed the was considered by the others 
she had very little notice from my but him 
miss singly wo engrossed mr dairy her sister scarcely leaf so 
and as for mr am by whom elizabeth eat he was an indolent nun who lived only to eat 
drink 
and play at cards 
who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a gout had not to say to her 
hen dinner was over the returned directly to jane and miss singly he an amusing her as soon as she was out of the room 
her manners were pronounced to be very had indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence 
she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty 
mrs burst thought the same and added a she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker 
i shall never forget her up france this morning 
she really looked almost wife do she did indeed louisa 
i could hardly keep m countenance 
very nonsensical to come at all 
they must the be calm ring about the country because her sister had a cold 
her hair so untied so blowing a eyes and her petticoat 
i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain 
and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office 
a your picture may be very exact louisa 1 laid single 
a but this was all lost upon me 
i thought maria lime bonnet looked remarkably well when he came into the room this morning 
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice 
a tap observed it mr fancy i am sure a said pride and prejudice 
35 miss singly 
2 and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition 
a certainly not a a to walk three miles or four miles or have miles or whatever it is above her fancies in dirt and alone quite alone 
what could she mean by it 
it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country-town indifference to decorum 
a it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bind lee 
i am afraid 5 barely observed miss mingle in a half whisper 2 that this adventure has rather affect your admiration of her line eyes a not at all he replied 
a they were brightened by the exercises a short pause followed this speech and mrs burst began again 
— a i have an excessive regard for jane bonnet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settle end 
but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in morton 
a yes 
and they have another who lives somewhere near chespside.” that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily 
if the had uncles enough to all all seaside 1 cried being by a it would not make them one jolt less agreeable 
a a but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world a replied dairy 
to this speech singly made no answer 
but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their 36 earn anne prejudice 
mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relation 
with a renewal of tenderer however to her room on leaving the dining-parlour in eat 
with her till summoned to coffee 
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when the had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than presume that the should go downstairs herself 
on entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at low and was immediately invited to join them 
but suspecting them to be playing high the declined it and making her sister the excuse rapid the would amused herself for the short time she could any below with a book 
mr burst looked at her with astonishment 
a do you prefer minding to cards 
a laid he 
2 that ll rather singular man eliza bonnet a said mine single a respite card 
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else ll believe neither such praise nor such censure 1 cried elizabeth 
a i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things 
a in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure a mind singly 
and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying 
he immediately offered to fetch her other that hit library afforded 
and i will my collection were larger for your bonnet and my own credit 
but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into 
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room 
none and prejudice 
37 i am astonished a said miss kindly that my father should have left so small a collection of books 
what a delightful library you have at pemherley mr dare 1 a bell ought to be good he replied 
it has been the work of many generations 2 and then you have added so much to it yourself 
you are always buying looks a i can not comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these 
a neglect 
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place 
charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful us pemberley.” i wish it ma -5 but i would really advise you to make your case in that new hbourhood and take duberley got a kind of mode 
there is not a line county in en land than derbyshire.” 1 it all my heart 
i will buy duberley itself if d will sell it 
am talking of possibilities charles 1 upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get duberley by purchase than by imitation 
elizabeth was so much can hit what passed as to leave her very little attention girl her book 
and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the charitable and stationed herself between mr bigger and his eldest sister to observe the game 
is miss mercy much grown since the spring 
a said miss singly 
will she be as tall as i am 
a a i think she will 
she is now about miss elizabeth bonnets her hat or rather taller how i me to see her again 
i never met with anybody who delighted me so much 
such a countess pin 
inn prejudice 
once such manners 
and is ready new for her age 
her performance on the is quuilite.’ 1 it in amazing to me a aid singly how young ladies can have pariencetoheloveryaocompliahed they all are a all young ladies accomplished 
my dear charles what do you mean 1 ye all of them i think 
they all paint tables cover keen and not pursue 
i scarcely know any one who can not do all thin and i am sure i never hard a young lady spoken of for the in time without being informed that the was very accomplished 
your list of the common extent of accomplishments a said fancy that too much truth 
the word in applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting purse or covering a tree 
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general 
i can not bout of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accord lined for l i am sure a said mine singly 
a then observed elizabeth a you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman 
yes i do comprehend a great deal in it 
oh 
certainly a cried his faithful assistant no one can be rally esteemed accomplished who does not greatly aux-peas what in usually met with 
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word 
and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the one of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved 1 all thin the must possess a added fancy a and m pride and prejudice 39 all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading 
i am no longer surprised at your knowing any six accomplished women 
i rather wonder now at your knowing my care you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this is i never saw such a woman 
i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united 
mrs burst and miss singly both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description w en mr burst called them to order with bitter complaints of their attention to what was going forward 
as all conversation was thereby at an end 
elizabeth soon afterwards left the room 
relics bonnet a said miss bringing when the door was closed on her 2 is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the order sex by undervaluing their own 
and with many men i dare say it succeed 
but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art 
a undoubtedly 1 replied dared to whom this remark was chiefly addressed 1 there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivating 
whatever bears ability to cunning is d icahle.” in singly was not so entirely satisfied with this up as to continue the subject 
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her 
being key urged mr jones being sent for immediately 
while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physician 
this so pride all 
predict 
would not hear of 
butthewat not to unwilling to complying with their brother proposal 
and it was settled that mr alone should be sent for early in the rising 
if mist bonnet were not decidedly better 
mingled was quite uncomfortable 
his linen declared that there miserable 
they placed their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could and no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every mention might be paid to the thick lady and her finger 
hum 3 
elizabeth poured the chief of the night in her sister room and in the morning had the league of being able to tend a tolerable answer to the inquiries which the very early receive from mr tinged by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his fingers 
in spite of this amendment however she bequeathed to have a note sent to longtown desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation 
the note wan immediately dispatched and its contents at quickly complied with 
mrs bonnet accord red he her two younger girls reached netherﬁel soon a 5 the family my breakfast 
had she found lane in any apparent danger bonnet would have been very useable 
but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherﬂeld 
she would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried home 
neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think pride and prejudice 
4 
it at all advisable 
after sitting a little while with jane on miss singly s appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour 
mingled met them with hopes that mrs bonnet had not found miss bonnet worse than she expected 
a indeed i have sir a was her answer 
a she is a great deal too ill to he moved 
mr jones says we must not think of moving her 
we must trespass a little longer on our kindness 
removed cried singly 
it must not be thought of 
my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal you may de d upon it madam 
said miss mingled with cod civility that miss bonnet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us mrs bonnet was profess in her acknowledgments 
i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and sullen a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with 
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to bar 
you have a sweet room here mr bigger and a charming prospect over that gravel walk 
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherﬁeld 
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short least a whatever i do is done in a hurry a replied he 
and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherﬁeld i should both be of 
in over minutes 
at present however i consider myself as quite vexed here 
that is exactly what i should have supposed of you a said elizabeth 
l. d 41 pride and prejudice 1 you begin to comprehend rule do you 
a cried he turning towards her 
a oh 
yes 
i understand you perfectly 
i wish i might take this for a compliment 
but to be no easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful 
that is as it happens 
it does not necessarily follow that a deep indicate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yourself a lazy 1 cried her mother a remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home i did not know before a continued singly immediately 2 that you were a study of character 
it must be an amusing study a yes but indicate characters are the mud 
amusing 
the have at least that advantage 
a he country a said dairy can in general supply but few subjects or such a study 
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very contented and unvarying society 
a at people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever yes indeed a cried mrs bonnet ol'l'ended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood 
i none you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town everybody was surprised and day after looking at her for a moment turned silently away 
mrs m who fancied she had gained a complete victory w him continued her triumph 
is 1 emma see that london has any got advantage 
a the country for my part except the shops and w due 
he country is a vast deal pleasanter is he 5 singly 
g i an in the country 1 he replied a i never a. by it 
and when i am in town it pretty pride and prejudice 
43 much the same 
they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either a ay 
that is because you have the right disposition 
but that gentleman 1 looking at dairy seemed to think the country was nothing at all 
indeed mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother 
you quite mistake mr dairy 
he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to he met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true 
certainly my dear nobody said there were 
but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhood larger 
i know we dine with four-and-twenty families nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable angles to keep his countenance 
his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards mr day with a very expressive smile 
elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucy had been at longtown since bar coming away 
a yes she called yesterday with her father 
what an agreeable man sir william is mr singly 
is not he 
so much the man of fashion 
so genteel and so gay 
he has always something to say to every 
— that 
is my idea of good breeding 
and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths unite mistake the matter 
a did charlotte me with you 
a no she would go home 
i fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies 
for my part mr singly i always keep servants that can do their own work 
my daughters are brought up differently 
but everybody is to judge for themselves and the cases are a very good sort of girls i assure you 
it is a pity they are 44 rain sun rnuumcn 
not handsome 
not that i think charlotte in very plain 
but then she is our particular friend she seems a very pleasant young woman a said singly 
oh 
dear ye 
but our must own the is very plain 
lady case here has often said so and envied one jane's beauty 
i do not like to boat of my own child but to be sure jane 
one does not often see anybody better looking 
it is what everybody says 
i do not trust my own rationality 
when she was only after there was a entieamnn at my brother gnrdiner’e in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away 
but however he did not 
perhaps he thought her too young 
however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were and so ended kill selection a mind elizabeth impatiently 
there he been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way 
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love 
a a i have been used to consider poetry at the food of love a said dairy 
of a one stout healthy love it may 
everything flourishes what is strong already 
but if the only a slight thin sort of inclination am convinced that one good sonnet will serve it entirely away mercy on smiled 
and the general paul which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again 
she on end to speak but could think of nothing to say 
and a tear a short silence mrs bonnet began repeating her thanks to mr singly for his kindness to jane with an apology for touching him also with lazy 
mr singly was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required 
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness pride and principal 45 but my bonnet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage 
upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward 
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr mingled with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a hall at nether-ﬁeld 
die was stout well-grown girl of fifteen with a one complexion and good-humoured countenance 
a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age 
she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural self-consequence which the attentions of the faces to whom her uncle good dinners and her own easy manner recommended her had increased into assurance 
she was very us therefore to address mr kindled on the subject of the ball and w reminded him of his promise 
adding that it d he the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it 
his answer to this sudden back was delightful to her mother 5 
a i am perfectly ready i assure you to in my engagement 
and when your sister is resolve on shall if you please name the very day of the ball 
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill india declared herself at led 
oh yes 
it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain canter would be at morton again 
and when you have given your ball 1 she added i shall insist on their giving one also 
shall tell colonel forswear it will be quite a shame if he does not mrs bonnet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr dairy 
the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingley’s witticisms on here year

mr hunt and mr singly were at pills and my hum was observing their game 
elizabeth took up some needlework and was izﬂicienlly exult in intending to what rolled between dairy and his companion 
the perpetual commendation of the lady either on his hand-writing or on the evening of his linen or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her pain were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each 
a how delighted in dare will be to receive such a lamb 
he made no answer 
a you write uncommonly fan 
a you are mistaken 
i write rather slowly 1 how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year 1 letters of business too 
how odious i should think them 5 
a it is fortunate then that they fall to my 10 instead of to ours

47 1 thank you 
but i always mend my own a how can you contrive to write so even i he was silent 
a tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp 
and pray let her know that i am quite in future with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley’s.” will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again l at present i have not room to do them justice 
a b 
it is of no consequence 
i shall see her in january 
but do on always write such charming long letters to her mr am i a they are general my long 
but whether always charm it is not for me to determine 1 it is a rule with me that a person who can write 3 iron letter with ease can not write till a what will not do for a compliment to carry caroline 1 cried her brother 
s because he does no 
write with ease 
he studies too much for words of four syllables 
do not you dare 
a my style of writing is very different from yours 
a oh 
cried miss single a charles writes in the most careless way imaginable 
he leaves out half his words and blow the rest 
my ideas now so rapidly that i have not time to express them 
say which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents 1 your humility mr single a said elizabeth a must disarm reproof 
a nothing is more deceive a said fancy a than the race of humility 
it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an interest boast 
and which of the two do you call in little recent piece of modesty 
48 some an predict 
the direct boast 
for you are really proud of your defects in writing 
because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and careless of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting 
the power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the 5 and often without an attention to the m too of the performance 
hen you told mrs met this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherﬁeld you should be gone in over minutes you want it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself 
and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitate which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else 
nay a cried singly this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning 
and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment 
at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitate merely to show at 
before the ladies 1 i dare say you believed it 
but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity 
your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know 
and if as our were mounting your horse a friend were to say a single you had better stay till next week a you would probably do it you would probably not go 
and at another word might stay a month you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr singly did not do justice to his own dish position 
you have shown him off now much more than he did himself i am exceedingly granted a said single a by your conversing what my friend sat s into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper 
t i am afraid you pride and prejudice 
49 are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend 
for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a fat denial and ride on as fast as i could would mr dairy then consider the harshness of your original intention as owned for by your obstinacy m adhering to it 
a 
upon my word i can not exactly explain the matter 
day must speak for himself a you ox t me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged 
allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss beast that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the dead of his plan has merely desired it asked it without a bring one argument in favour of its propriety to yield readily 
early 
w the german m of a friend is no merit with you a t 5 yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either a you appear to me mr dared to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection 
a regard for the request would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it 
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as on have supposed about 5 being by 
we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereon 
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to he argued into it 
a will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree s pride and prejudice 
of importance which is so splendid to this not as well this as the degree of intimacy subsisting weaken the parties -5 a a by all means a cried singly 
let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size 
for that will have more weight in the argument miss bonnet than you may be aware of 
i assure you that if dairy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference 
i declare i do not know a more awful object than mercy on particular occasions and in particular places 
at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do mr dairy smiled 
but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh 
miss singly warmly resented the indignity he had received in an cxpostulatiou with her brother for talking such nonsense 
a i see your design singly said his friend 
— a you dislike an argument and want to silence this 
a perhaps i do 
arguments are too much like disputes 
if you and miss bonnet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful 
and then you may say whatever you like of me a what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side 
and mr dairy had much better said his letters mr dairy took her advice and did punish his letter 
when that business was over he applied to miss bigger and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music 
miss singly moved with alacrity to the piano-forte 
and after a polite request that elizabeth would lad the way which the other as likely and more earnestly negative she tired herself 
of mrs burst sang win her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as pride and prejudice 
5 
she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument how free gently mr careys eyes were fixed on her 
she ha my knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to no great a man 
and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange 
she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was is something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other soon present 
the supposition did not pain her 
she liked him too little to care for his approbation 
after playing some italian songs miss singly varied the charm by a lively scotch air 
and soon afterwards mr dairy drawing near elizabeth aid to her 
do not you feel a great inclination miss bonnet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a real 
she smiled but made no answer 
he repeated the question with some sue rise at her silence 
oh 
a said she a heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to lay in reply 
you wanted me i know to say a yes 2 that on might have the pleasure of desiring my taste 
but always delight in overthrown those kind of schemes and beating a m of their premeditated contempt 
i have terror made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a meal at all 
and now despise me if you cared a indeed i do not dare elizabeth having rather expected to around him was amazed at his gallantry 
but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult or her to affront anybody 
and day had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her 
he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger 5 hid

it would not be any indeed to catch their expressions but their colour and shape and the eye when it remarkably one might be copied at that moment they were met from another walk by man burst and elizabeth herself i did not know that you intended to walk a aid in mingle in some conclusion lest they had been overheard 
a you used no abominably ill 1 answered mrs hunt a running away without telling us that you were coming out 
pride and prejudice 
3 then taking the disengaged arm of mr dairy she let elizabeth to walk by herself 
the path admitted three 
mr dairy felt their rudeness and immediately said 
a this walk is not wide enough for our party 
we had better go into the avenue but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughing answered 
a no no 
stay where you are 
you are charmingly groups and a 5 to uncommon advantage 
the picturesque wo d be spoilt by admitting a fourth

by she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she ramble about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two 
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening 
chapter i 
hen the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing-room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure 
and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared 
their powers of conversation were considerable 
they could describe an entertainment with curacy relate an anecdote with humour and loud he at their acquaintance with spirit 
out when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object 
miss bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards dairy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many 4 pride and predict 
steps 
he addressed himself directly mill bonnet with a polite congratulation 
mr us also made her a slight bow and said he was a very glad 1 but dilliiseness and warmth remained for bingley’s salutation 
he was full of by and attention 
the first half-hour was spent in pulling up the free lest she should suffer from the change of room 
and she removed at his desire to the other side of the place that she might be further from the door 
he then r. down by her and talked scarcely to any one else 
elizabeth at work in the opposite comer w it all with great delight 
when tea was over mr hum reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table 
but in vain 
she had obtained private intelligence that mr day did not wish for cards 
and mr burst soon found even his open petition rejected 
she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her 
mr hours had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the shops and go to sleep 
fancy took up a book 
miss singly did the same 
and mrs burst principally occupied in playing with her blameless and rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss bonnet 
miss being key s attention was quite as much engaged in watching air careys progress through bit book as in reading her own 
and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page 
she could not win him however to any conversation 
he merely answered her question and read on 
at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said a how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way 
i declare after all there is no enjoyment like ranks and pnnmnrcn 
as reading 
how much sooner one tires of anything than of a book l 
when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library no one made any reply 
she then dawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest 
of some amusement 
when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bonnet she turned suddenly towards him and said 
by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherlield 
— i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party 
i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure 
if you mean arch 1 cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins 
but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing 
and as soon as mitchells has made while soup enough i shall send round my cards i should like balls infinitely better 1 she replied if they were carried on in a different manner 
but there is something insulfcmbl tedious in the usual process of such a meeting 
t would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day a much more rational my dear caroline i dare fly but it would not be near so much like a ball 
miss singly made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room 
her figure was elegant and she walked well 
— 
but dairy at whom it was all aimed was still insensibly studious 
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said 
a miss eliza bonnet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room 
— l assure so sin and pncmnrcc 
you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately 
miss singly succeeded no less in the real object of her civility 
mr dairy looked up 
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book 
he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere 
what could he mean 
she was dying to know what could be his meaning 
— and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him 
not at all a was her answer 
but depend upon it 
he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it 
miss singly however was incapable of dim hinting mr dairy in anything and persevered there are in requiring an explanation of his two motives 
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them a said he as soon as she a loved him to speak 
you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your guest appear to the greatest advantage in walking 
— if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the free 
oh 
shocking 
cried miss singly 
i never heard anything so abominable 
how shall we punish him for such a speech 2 
nothing so ca if you have but the inclination a said elizabeth 
a a can all plague and punish one pride and prejudice another 
tease him 
laugh at him 
intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done but upon my honour i do not 
i do aware you that my intimacy has not yet taught me but 
tease calmness of temper and presence of mind 
no no 
i feel he may defy us there 
and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you lease by attempting to lad he without a subject 
5 dairy may hug him -5 1 mr mercy is not to be laughed at 
cried elizabeth 
that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would he a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance 
i depart love laughed his singly said he a has given me credit for more than can be 
the wisest and the best of men 
my the wisest and best of their actions 
pray be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke certainly a replied elizabeth 
a there are such people hurt hope i am not one of men 
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good 
follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies la driven me i own and i laugh at them whenever i canopus these i suppose are precisely what you are without 
perhaps that is not possible for any one 
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding lot ridicule 
such as vanity and pride a yew vanity is a weakness indeed 
but pride 
where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulations he elizabeth turned away to hide a smile 
your examination of mr mercy is over i presume a said miss singly 
and pray what is the result 
i 
1 8 pride and prejudice 
i am perfectly convinced by it that mr dairy has no defect 
he owns it himself without disguise knot 
said fancy a i have made no such pretension 
i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding 
my temper i dare not vouch for 
it is i believe too little yielding 
certainly too little for the convenience of the world 
i can not forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself 
my feelings are not suffer about with every attempt to move them 
my temper would perhaps s be called resentful 
— 
my good opinion once lost is out for ever 
that is a failing indeed 
— cried elizabeth 
“implacable resentment i a shade in a character 
but you have chosen your fault well 
i really can not long at it 
you are safe from me there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil 
a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome 2 and your defect is a propensity to hate everybody 2 and yours 1 he replied with a smile his wilfully to understand them do let 
us have a little music cried miss singly tired of a conversation in which the had no share 
a louisa you will not mind my waking mr burst 
a her sister made not the smallest objection and the pianoforte was opened 
and day after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it 
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention 
pride and prejudice 50 hum 13 
a consequence of an agreement between the listen elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage i hit be sent for them in the course of the day 
but felt as bonnet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherﬁeld till the following tones which would exactly banish jane's week could not ring herself to receive them with pleasure before 
her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeth wishes for she was impatient to get home 
mrs bonnet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday 
and in her postscript it was added that if mr bigger and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well 
a last staying longer however elizabeth was sitive‘l 
l resolved 
nor did the much expect it you d be asked 
and fearful on the contrary it being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr binglcy’s carriage immediately and it was at length settled that their original design of leaving netherﬁeld that morning should be mentioned and the red nest made 
the communication excited many professions of concern 
and now he was said of wishing them to stay at least till the far loving day to work on jane 
and till the morrow their going was deferred 
miss singly was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other 
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bonnet that it would not be safe for her 
that she was not enough recovered 
but jane was farm where she felt herself to be right so ran and practice 
to mr fancy it was welcome intelligence 
elizabeth had been it netherﬁeld long enough 
she warmed him more than he liked 
and in singly mundvilm‘er lend mommingehanusualrohimiell 
he wisely resolved to be particularly career in no do admiration should jump him 
nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing mﬁﬁciry 
aemiblethatifuchanideahadbeen his 
behaviour during the man day must have ungenial weight in confirming or cunning it 
steady to hit purple he ran her pocket ten word to her through the whole of saturday 
and though they were at one time left by themselves for half 
hour he gathered mot conldentloualy to his book 
and would no even look at her 
on sunday after morning service the reparation 
to be to almost all took place 
in bingley‘l civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane 
and when they parted after staring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to act her either at longtown or netherﬁeld and embracing her most tenderly the even shook hand 
i 
the former 
elizabeth fool leave of whole pang in the lively spirits 
they were not welcomed home very cordially by mr mother 
my bonnet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again 
but godfather thou m very laconia in his expressions of man was real ay glad to see them 
he had felt their prince in the family circle 
the evening contention when they were all assembled had lost much of in animation and almost all its sense by the absence of and elizabeth 
they found mary as usual deep in the study of much has and human nature 
and had come new arm and pnejumcs 
or extend to admire and some new observations of threadbare omit to listen to 
catherine and l did had information or them of a different sort 
much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the receding wednesday 
several of the officers had in lately with their uncle a private had been begged and it had actually been hinted that colonel porter was going to be married 
chapter 33 
a hope my dear a said mr bonnet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning 2 that you have ordered a good dinner to-day because i have reason to expect an addition to our family it -5 pauywho do you mean my dear 
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucy should happen to call in 
and i hope my dinners are good enough for her 
i do not believe she often sees such at home 
2 the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger mrs bonnets s as startled 
a gentleman and a stranger 
it is single i am sure 
why jane 
— you never do t a word of this 
you sly thing 
well i am sure shall be extremely glad to see mr singly 
— but 
good lord 
how unlucky 
there is not a bit of cash to be got to doze 
ladies move ring the bell 
i must speak to his 
this moment it is not mr single a said her husband 
a it is green whom i never saw in the whole course of my i this roused a general astonishment 
and he had the 6 me my prejudices 
pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and live caught at once 
after musing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained 
about a month ago i received this letter 
and shoot a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention 
it is from my cousin mr cotillions who when i an dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he led a oh 
my dear 1 cried his wife i can not bear to hear that mentioned 
pray do not talk of that odious man 
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entangled away from your own children 
and i am sure if i had been you i should lute tried long ago to do something or other about it 
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entire 
they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which my bonnet was beyond the reach of reason and the continued to fail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of live daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about 
a it certainly is a most iniquitous affair a said mr bonnet and nothing can clear mr cousins from the guilt of inheriting longtown 
but if you will listen to his clever you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself no that i am sure i shall not 
and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical i hate such false friends 
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did infuse him i a why indeed 
he does seem to have had some had temples on that head as you will hear mobs and summer 
3 a uniform near western lent a i with october 
dear is 4 the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach 
but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance 
— a there mrs bonnet 
my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the parsonage of the right honourable lady catherine de ought widow of sir louisa de bough whose county and benevolence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to form those rises and ceremonies which are institute by the church of england 
as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in 1 families within the reach of my innocence 
and on these grounds i better myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the detail of longtown estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to respect the offered olive-branch 
i can not be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends 
but of this hereafter 
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself f the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november 8th by four o'clock and shall 6 mobs and prejudice probably trespass on you hospitality till the saturday se'nnight following which can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day 
— i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your well-wisher and friend william collins.” at four o'clock therefore we ma expect this leave-taking gentleman said mr nest as he folded up the letter 
a he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to et him come to us again a there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is to make them any amends i shall not be the person to encourage him 
though it is difficult a said jane 1 to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of threatening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required he must be an oddly i think said she 
i can not make him out 
there is something very pompous in his style 
— and what can he mean by apologising for being next in the fail i 
we can not suppose he would help it if he could 
— can he be a sensible man air 3 a a no my dear 
i think not 
i have great hopes of sending him quite the reverse 
there is a mixture of severity and self-importance in his letter which promises well 
i am impatient to see him 
moves me prejudice 
of in not of come tom said this letter does notpgleem terms 
the idea omolive-bmch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well ox dressed a catherine and ladies neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting 
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour 
as for their mother mr collins’a letter had done away much of her ill-will and she was preparing to see him with i degree of composure which finished her husband and daughters 
mr cotillions was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family 
mr bonnet indeed said little 
but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr cotillions seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself 
he was a nail happy-looking young man of five-and-twenty 
his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal 
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bonnet on having so once a family of daughters 
said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short 
of the truth 
and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage 
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers 
but mrs bonnet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily 
a you are very kind i am sure 
and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be estimated enough 
things are settled so oddly 
a a or allude perhaps to the detail of this estate ah 
sir i do indeed 
it is s grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess 
not that i mean to and fault with joy for such things i know are all chance of pride and prejudice 
in this world 
there is no knowing how state will go when once they come to be entailed.” i am very amiable madam of the hardships to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate 
but i can atone the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them 
at present i will not say more 
but 
perhaps when we are better acquainted 
a he was interrupted by a summons to dinner 
and the girls smiled on each other 
they were not the only objects of mr collins’e admiration 
the hall the dining-room and all its furniture were examined and praised 
and his commendation of everything would cure touched my bonnet heart but for the mortifying inspiration of his viewing it all as his own future property 
the dinner too in its turn was highly admiral 
and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its croaking was owing 
but he he was not right by mrs bonnet who insured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen 
he begged pardon for having displeased her 
in a softening tone the declared herself not at all offended 
but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour 
¢bnpttr 37 
during dinner mr bonnet scarcely spoke at all 
but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very minute in his patroness 
lady catherine de bought mobs and prejudice 
31 attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable 
mr bonnet could not have chosen better 
mr cotillions was eloquent in her praise 
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that 
he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank 
such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine 
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her 
she had also asked him twice to dine at musings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening 
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many pool i he knew but be had never seen anything but xliii it in her 
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman 
she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations 
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion 
and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and ha even vouchsafed to suggest some herself 
some shelves in the closets upstairs 2 that is all very proper and civil i am more 
said mrs bonnet 2 and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman 
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her 
does she live near you sir i 4 the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from prosings park her ladyship residence 1 i think you said she is a widow sir 
has she any family i 
3 pride and prejudice 
a she has one only daughter the veil of rolling 
and of very extensive property 1 all a cried my bonnet shaking her head then she in better off than many girls 
and events sort of young lady is the 
is she handsome i a a she is a most charming young lady indeed 
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty in de bought it far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marking the young woman of distinguished birth 
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in man accomplishments which she could not otherwise have ailed of as i am informed by the lady who superintend her education and who still resided with them 
but she is perfectly amiable and often condescend to drive by my humble abode in her little place and bones 
a hat she been presented 
i do not remember her name among the ladies at council there indifferent state of health unhappily prevent her being in town 
and by that means as i to d lady catherine myself one day has de arrived the brisk court of its brightest ornament 
her ladyship seemedpleased with the idea 
and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate coop mental which are always acceptable to ladies 
i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a chest and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her 
— these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it in a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay 
you judge very properly a said mr bonnet and it in happy for you that you possess the talent of latter 
in with delicacy 
may i ask whether these pleasing pride and women 
by attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study 
a they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible 
mr bonnets expectations were fully answered 
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no other in his pleasure 
meantime however the dose had been enough and mr bonnet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies 
mr cotillions readily assented and a book was produced 
but on beholding it for everything announced it to he for a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels 
kitty stared at him and ladies exclaimed 
other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose fordyce’s sermons 
ladies gape as he opened the volume and before he had with very monstrous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with 
a do you know mamma that my uncle philip talks of turning away richard 
and if he does lonely former will hire him 
my aunt 
told me so herself on saturday 
i shall walk to mention to-morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr deny comes back from town die was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue 
but mr cotillions much offended laid aside his book and said 
— i have often observed how little young ladies are so pride and pr'iiudici 
interrupted by books a serious damp though written offer for their bent 
it makes me i conceal 
— for certainly there can be nothing so admtageoua to them it instruction 
but i will no longer importune my young cousin 
then turning to mr bonnet 
he offered himself it hit octagon at backgammon 
mr bonnet accepted the change observing that he acted very wine in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusement 
in bonnet and her daughter apologized coat civilly for lydia’l interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would rear his book 
but mr calling after assuring them that he bore hit young could no ill-will and should never relent her behaviour any affront outer himself at another table with mr bonnet and prepared for backgammon 
cheer 17 
5 cotillions was not a terrible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little actuated by education or society 
the greater part of mr life having been spent on her the guidance of an illiterate and misery father 
and though he belonged one of the univeraiu'ea he had merely kept the necessary warmed without forming at it any useful acquaintance 
lie subjection in which his father had brought him up ll given him originally great humility of manner 
but it ve now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit m a weak head living in retirement and the consequence twinkling of early and unexpected prosperity 
a minute chance had recommended him to lady \‘wlhm‘ne de bough when the driving of rumford was new 
i and the respect which he feel t for her high rank 7 pride and prejudice 
mrs bonnet treasure up the hint adjusted that she might soon have two daughter married 
and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces 
ladies s intention of walking to mention was not forgotten 
every sister except mary agreed to go with her 
and mr cotillions was to attend them at the request of mr bonnet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself 
for thither mr cotillions had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest flies in the collection but really talking to mr bonnet with little cessation of his house and garden at rumford 
such doings discomposed mr bonnet exceedingly 
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity 
and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there 
his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr calling to join his daughters in their walk 
and mr cotillions being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go 
in pompous nothings on his side and civil ascent on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered mercy 
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by in 
their eyes were immediately wandering it in the street in quest of the others and nothing can than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recall them 
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike 2 entrance walking with an office on the other side of the way 
the office was the very mr deny concerning whose return from london pride and prejudice 
7 
and hit veneration for her as his patroness ringing with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and all right a a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obeequiousneu claim dance and humility 
having now a good home and very sufficient income he intended to mar 
and in seeking a reconciliation with the longtown ilidmily he had a wife in view as he meant to cheat one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report 
this was his plan of amends 
of atonement 
for inheriting their fathers estate 
and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and mitahlencss and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part 
his lean did not vary on seeing them 
miss bonnets lovely ice confirmed his views and cmlblishcd all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority 
and for the first evening s was his settled choice 
the next morning however made an alteration 
for in a quarter of an hour tétc-h-téte with mrs bent before remark 
fast a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longtown produced from her amid very complaisant switch and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on 
a as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say 
she could not positively answer 
— but she did not new of any prepossession 
— 
her elder 
daughter she must just mention 
she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely be very soon engaged mr cotillions had only to change from jane to elizabeth 
and it was soon done 
done while mrs bonnet was stirring the fire 
elizabeth equally next to jump in birth and beauty succeeded her of course 
pride and prejudice 7 l dies came to inquire and he bowed as they passed 
a were struck with the strangers air all wondered who he could be 
and kitty and ladies determined if possible to and out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot 
mr deny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend sir twickenham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps 
this was exactly as it should be 
for the young man wanted only regiment to make him completely charming 
his appearance was greatly in his favour 
he had all the best part of beauty 3 one countenance a good figure and very pleasing address 
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation 
a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and assuming 
and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and dry and kindly were seen riding down the street 
on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities 
mingled was the principal spoken and miss bonnet the principal object 
he was then he said on his way to longtown on purpose to inquire after her 
mr dairy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to ix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly corrected by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting 
both changed colour one looked white the other red 
mr wick after a few moments touched his hat 
i. f 4 pride and prejudice 
no salutation which mr day must designed to return 
what could be the meaning omit it i 
it was impossible to imagine 
it was if possible not to long to know 
in another minute or kindly but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend 
mr penny and mr twickenham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr philippics house and then made their bows in spite of miss india s pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs philippics throwing up the parlour window and loudly descending the invitation 
is hills was always glad to see her nieces 
and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprize at their sudden return home which as their own marriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr jones s schoolboy in the street who had told her that they were not to send an more draughts to netherﬁeld because the miss events were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr cot in by jane's introduction of him 
she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologizing for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice 
mrs path is was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding 
but her contempt action of one stranger was soon put an end to by excel actions and inquiries about the other 
of whom however she could only tell her nice what they already knew that mr decay had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the 
— hire 
she had been watchpride and prejudiced in him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr twickenham appeared kitty and ladies would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the manager were become a stupid disagreeable fellow some of them were to dine with the philippics the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wicket and give him an invitation also if the family from longtown would come in the evening 
this was agreed to and mrs philip protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of letters tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards 
the prospect of such delights was very cheering 
and the parted in mutual good spirits 
mr cotillions repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearied civility that they were perfectly needless 
as they w red home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen 
but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more ox lain such behaviour than her sister 
5 calling on his return highly gratified mrs bonnet by admiring mrs philippics manners and politeness 
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman 
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before 
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life 
a my pride and premises 
cheat 17 
s no objection was made to the young people a engagement 
with their aunt and all mr collin-’1 scruples of leaving mr and my bonnet for in single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his ve cousins at a table hour to mention 
and the had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the down room that mr william had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the house 
when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr cotillions was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at prosings 
a cow poison that did not at first convey much gratification 
out when mrs philip understood from him what prosings was and who was its proprietor 
when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine's drawing-rooms and found that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds 
she felt all the force of the compass intent and would hardly have repeated a comparison with the housekeeper room 
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digression praise of his own humble abode and the dim movements it was receiving 
he was happily employ untied the gentlemen joined them 
and he found in mrs philip 3 very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to detail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could 
to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wind moss and prejudice 
17 for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitation of china on the mantelpiece the interval of waiting appeared ve iron 
it was over at at however 
g he ntleriiyen did approach and when mr twickenham w key into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration 
the officers of the 
— 
— hire were in general a very creditable gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party 
but mr william was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as thy were superior to the rosy-faced stuff uncle philip breathing port wine who followed them into the room 
mr william was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself 
and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker 
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr wicket and the officers mr cotillions seemed to sink into insignificance 
to the young ladies he certainly was nothing 
but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs pills and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muff 
when the card-tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist 
i know little of the are at present a said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation in life 
a mrs hills was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason 
mr twickenham did not play at whist and with ready 8 pride and prejudice 
delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and ladies 
at first there seemed danger of lying n't engrossing him entire 
for she was i most determined talker 
but being a clue extremely fond of letters thicker 
she won grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bet and exclaiming after prize to have attention for any one in particular 
allowing for the common demands of the em mr twickenham wan therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and the was very willing to hear him though what the child will to hear the could not hope to he told the history of his acquaintance with mr dairy 
she dared not even mention that gentleman 
her curiosity however 
was unexpected relieved 
mr wick began the subject himself 
he inquired how far netherﬁeld was from morton 
and after receiving her answer liked in a haunting manner how long mr dairy had been staying there 
about a month 1 aid elizabeth 
and then unwilling to let the object drop added a he is a man of v very large property in derby-hire i undcritjnd.” a year a lie wickhamg 
this estate there in a noble one 
clear ten thousand per annum 
you could not have met with a person more capable giving a certain information on that head than myself 
for have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy -5 elizabeth could not at look surprized 
a you may well be surprised mill bonnet at such an action after seeing 
as you probably might 
the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday 
are you much acquainted with mr fancy i a a as much at i ever with to he a cried elizabeth warmly 
— a i have spent four day 
in the same home with him and i think him very disagreeable 1 i have no right to give my opinion a said sickness and newest 
7th ham as to his being agreeable or otherwise 
i am not qualified to form one 
i have known him too long and too well so be a fair judge 
it is impossible for m to be impartial 
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish 
and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else 
here you are in your own family 1 upon my word i say no more bar than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherﬁeld 
he is not at all liked in herefordshire 
everybody is dining with his pride 
you will not lend him more favourably key of by an one 
a i can not pretend to be sorry a said wick after a short interruption 
that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts 
but with line i believe it does not often happen 
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen a i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an ill-tempered man twickenham only shook his had 
a i wonder a said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer a i do not at all know 
but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherlield 
i hope your plans in favour of the 
shirts will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood 
oh 
no 
it is not for m to be driven away by mr dairy 
if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go 
we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding bias but what i might proclaim before all the world 
a sense of very great ill-usage and most painful degree at his being what he is 
his father miss bonnet the 8 pride and prejudice 
late mr dairy was one of the best man that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had 
and i can never be in company with this mr dry without being a grieved to the so by a thousand tender recollections 
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous 
but i verily believe 1 could forgive him anything and everything rather than his disappointing the hopes and discerning the memory of his father elizabeth found the interest of the sun t income and listened with all her heart 
but the efficacy of it prevented farther inquiry 
mr twickenham begun to speak on more general topics me up the neighbourhood the society appearing high ye pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligent a gallantry 
it was the respect of constant society and good society 1 he and led a which was my chief inducement to enter the 
— hire 
i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend deny tempted me further by his account of their present manners and the ve great attentions and excellent acquaintance morton hail procured them 
society i own is necessary to me 
i have been a dismal pointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude 
i must have employment and society 
a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible 
the church taught to have been my profession 
i was brought up for the church and i thou d at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now a indeed 
a a yes 
the late mr dairy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift 
he was my godfather and excessively attached to me 
i can not do justice to his kindness 
he meant to provide for pride and prejudice 
3 me am by and thought he had done it 
but when the living it was given elsewhere 
a good heavens 
a cried elizabeth 
a but how could but be i 
how could his will be disregarded 
— why did not you seek legal repress 
a 
there was just such an infinity in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law 
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr dairy chose to doubt it 
or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence 
in short anything or nothing 
certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man 
and no less certain is it that i not accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it 
i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely 
i can recall nothing worse 
but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me 
a this is quite shocking 
he deserves to be publicly disgraced 1 some time or other he will be 
but it shall not be by m. till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose line elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them 
a but what a said she after a pause a can have been his motive 
— what can have induced him to behave so cruelly 
a a a thorough determined dislike of me 
a dislike which i can not but attribute in some measure to jealousy 
had the late mr dearly liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his father's uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in i annum kill behinawuhhm fdhiuﬂind

and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make live shilling s any object 
there are undoubtedly many who ca d not say the name but thank to lady catherine de brought i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters 
mr wickham’s attention was caught 
and after observing mr calling for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bough 
lady catherine de bough she replied his very lately given him a living 
i hardly know how mr cotillions was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long you know of course that lady catherine de bough and lady anne dairy were sisters 
consequent that she is aunt to the recent mr darcy.” 1 or indeed i did on 
l knew nothing at all of lady catherine s connection 
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday 
a her daughter miss de bough will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates 
this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor mine singly 
vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already selfdestined to another 
our calling said she speak highly both or lady catherine and her daughter 
but from some particular that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his parents the is an arrogance conceited woman 1 i believe her to be both in a great degree replied richard 
a i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that 36 pride and price

elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and the continued talking together with mutual satisfaction appear put an end to care and gave the rent of the ladies their share of mr wickham’l attentions 
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs philip supper party but hit manner recommended him to everybody

and whatever he did done gracefully 
elizabeth went away with her head full of him 
she could think of nothing but of mr wicket and of what he had told her all the way home 
but there war not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither india nor mr claim were once silent 
ladies talked incessant of lot it age of the she she had lost and the sigh she ha won

calm 1791 
elizabeth related to jane the next day what had awed between mr wicket and herself 
jane fastened with astonishment and concern 
— 
she knew not how to believe that mr dairy could be pride and prejudice 37 so unworthy of mr singly s regard 
and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as withdraw 
the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings 
and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained 
they have both a said she a been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea 
interested pale have perhaps i resented each to the other 
t is in short impossible 5 us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side a very true indeed 
— 
and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business 2 
do dear i as too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody laugh as much as you church but you will not laugh me out of my opinion 
m dearest size do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr dared to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner 
one whom his father had promised to provide for 
it is impossible 
no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable it 
can his most intimate friends he so excessively deceived in him i 
oh no i can much more easily believe mr bingley’s being imposed on than that mr twickenham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night 
names facts everything mentioned without ceremony 
if it be not so let mr dairy contradict it 
besides there was truth in his looks 38 prone rum nice 
a it in difficulty indeed 
it in was 
one does not know what to think 
i a room 
one known exact what to william your up 1 but jane could think with certainty on only one point 
that mr singly if he bad keen on would have much to supper when the affair became public 
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persona of whom they had been speaking mr bigger and heighten came to give their personal invitation for the long hall at netherﬁeld which was fixed for the fool owing tuesday 
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again 
called it an age since they had met and relmtcrlly asked what she half been doing with herself since their separation 
to the rest of the family they paid little attention 
avoiding my bonnet 2 much an possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others 
they were noon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by an size and hurrying off an if eager to escape from an inner civilities 
the prospect of the netherlield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family 
my bonnet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr singly himself instead of a ceremonious card 
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attention of their brother 
and elizabeth thou hit with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr charm and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr careys look and behaviour

and though more amused than gratified herself by thin effect of her charms it wan not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to law 
elizabeth however did not chose to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply

if there had not been a netherﬁeld ball to prepare for and talk of the younger mite bonnet would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to mary once 
no aunt no officer 
no new could be sought after 
the very shoe-roses for netherlield were got by proxy

chapter xiii 
ill elizabeth entered the drawn from at netherﬁeld and looked in vain for 5 twickenham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being resent had never occurred to her 
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked b any of those recollections that might not unreasoua ye have alarmed her 
she had dressed with more than usual care and repeated in the highest s write for the conquest of all that remained unamused of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening 
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr careys pleasure in the ingleyu’ invitation to the officers 
and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr delay to whom india eagerly applied and who told them that william had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned 
adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away us now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gun remain here this part of his intelligence though unheard by die was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that day was not less answerable for wickham’l absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so she used by immediate disappointment that she could ha my reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approach to make 
attention forbearance patience with dry was injury to wicked 
she was resolved against 9 
mr and 
rich any nor of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which aim could not wholly tumult even in speaking to mr singly where blind partiality provoked her 
but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour 
and though every prospect of her own was delayed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits 
and having told all her grief 
to charlotte laura whom dnhadnmnenforawuhthewuwonablewmake a voluntary transition to the addition of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice 
the two am dancer however brought a return of distress 
they were dances of mortification 
mr calling awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the charm and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dance can give 
the moment of her release from him was early 
she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking ofwickham and of hearing that beware universally liked 
when those dances were over the returned to charlotte luck and war in conversation with her when she found himself suddenly addressed by mr day who took her so much by surprise in hit application for her hand that without knowing what she did the accepted him 
he walked away again immediately and the was left to fret over her own want of pretence of mind 
charlotte tried to console her 
a i dare say you will send him very agreeable 
a heaven forbid 
— that 
would be the greatest misfortune of all l 
to and a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate 
— do not wish me such an evil 
when the dancing recommenced however and day approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help stationing her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wicket to make her appear pride and prejudice 
3 pleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence 
elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she we arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr dairy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in holding it 
they stood for some time without asking a word 
and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was reaching not to break it 
till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance 
he replied and was again silent 
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with 
a it is your turn to say something now mr dairy 
i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said 
a v well 
that reply will do for the present 
perhaps and by i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones 
but now we may be silent a do you talk by rule then while you are dancing 
a a sometimes 
one must g a little you know 
it would look odd to be entire my silent for half an hour together 
and yet for the advantage of raw conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible 1 are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine 2 
a both replied elizabeth archly 
a for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds 
we are each of an social tacit disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that 9 pride and prejudice 
will amuse the whole room and be handed down to party with all the eclat of a proverb 1 this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am more a said he 
a how near it may be to mine i can not pretend to my 
ton think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly 
i must not decide on my own performances he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if the and her sisters did not very often walk to mary 
she answered in the affirmative 
and unable to resist the temptation added a when you met us there the other day we had been forming a new acquaintance the effect was immediate 
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he aid not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on 
at length dairy spoke and in a command manner said 
mr william is blessed with such happy manners at my encourage his ruling friends 
whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain 
a he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with em basis 
and in a manner 
which he it likely to suffer from all his life 
day made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject 
at that moment sir william lucy appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room 
but on perceiving mr dairy he stopped with a how of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner 
i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir 
such very superior dancing is not often seen 
it is evident that you belong to the first circles 
allow me to say however that your fair partner does not his 
grace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure pride and prejudice 
as often repeated l when a coming desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and kindly shall take place 
what congratulations will then how in 
i appeal to mr dairy 
but let me not interrupt you sin 
you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching convent of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraid melt the latter it of this address was scarcely heard by day 
but william's allusion to his friend seemed to make him forcibly and his 
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bigger and jane who were dancing together 
recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said a sir william's interruption has made me forget what we 
were talking of 
i do not think we were speaking at all 
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves 
we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i can not imagine a what think you of books 2 a said he smiling 
looks 
oh 
no 
i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feeling a 1 am sorry you think so 
but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject 
we may compare different opinions no 
i not talk of books in a ball-room 
my head is always full of something else they pray 
always occupied on in such scenes 
does it 
a mind he with a look of man eyes always a she replied without knowing what the said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her sudden exclaiming i remember hearing you once say i fancy that you hardly ever forgave that your presented me and newest 
men once cured was unappeanhle 
you are very cautious i suppose as to its being tread 
a i am a said he with a warm voice 
2 and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice 
a a i hope not 
a it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at lit 
may i ask to what these questions tend 
a a merely to the illustration of your character a said she endeavouring to shake of her gravity 
i am trying to make it out 
and what is your success 
a she shook her head i do not get on at all 
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly 1 i can readily believe 1 answered he gravely 2 that its ma a breath with respect to me 
and i killed wishymisr bell that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would respect no credit on either but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours 1 he coldly replied 
she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence 
on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in days breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another 
they had not long separated when miss singly came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her 
a so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george twickenham 
your pride and prejudice 
go sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions 
and i and that the young man forgot to me you man his other communications that he was the son of old kick the late mr careys steward 
let me recommend you however as a friend not to ve implicit confidence to all his assertions 
for as to 5 careys using him ill it is perfectly false 
for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though rage wicked has treated mr dairy in a most infamous manner 
i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr mercy is not in the least to blame that he can not hear to hear george twickenham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way 
his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it 
i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt 
but real considering his descent one old not ox t much uttered his guilt an his descent appear by your account rub the same said elizabeth angrily 
for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr careys steward and of bar i can assure you he informed me himself a i beg your pardon replied miss singly turning away with a sneer 
a excuse my interference it was kindly means a silent girl 
said elizabeth to herself 
you are much mistaken if you expect to induce me by such a paltry attack as this 
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr arch 
she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of single 
jane met her with a smile of such sweet 8 run and miles 
complacency 
a glow of inch happy up uﬁicientlymarkedhovvell ﬁewundﬁdwith the occurrence of the evening 
elizabeth read herﬁdinggandatthat met nnlicimde for mickleham resentment against his enemies and everything daggavevayhefme the hope anne lacing in the aim way for happiness 1 i want to know laid she with a countenance no leaning than her bitter what you have am about mr richard 
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person 
in which can you may be sure of my pardon into a replied jane i have not forgotten him 
but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you 
mr singly does not know the whole of his finery and in quite ignorant of the circumstance which have principally offended mr dairy 
but he will vouch for the good conduct the property and honour of his friend and in perfect convinced that mr wicked has deserved much et attention from mr day than he has received 
and i am any to ray that by his accountable at his driver s mr wicket in by means a respectable young man 
i am afraid he in been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr dairy s regard mrs singly does not know mr twickenham himself 
a knot 
he never saw him all the other morning at meryton.” this account then is what he has received from mr dairy 
i an perfectly sailed 
but what does he say of the living 
a he does not exactly recollect the circular thoughhehaahmdthem from mr anymore than once but he believes that it was left to him only 
no sun romance 
9 1 i have not a doubt of mr bingley’s sincerity 1 laid elizabeth warmly 
but 
you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only 
mr bingley’s defence of his friend win a very able one i dare say 
but since he is unacquainted with several port of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before 
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment 
elizabeth listened with delight to the ha though modest hopes which jane entertained of biggiey’s regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it 
on their being joined by mr singly himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucy 
to whose inquiry after the unpleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr cotillions came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery 
i have found out said he a by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness 
i happened to overcome the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bough and of her mother lady catherine 
how wonderfully these sort of things occur 
who would have thought of or meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine he bought in this assembly 
i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before 
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology 1 you are not going to introduce yourself to mr dare 
“l’hdeed i am 
i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier 
i believe him to be lady too pride and prejudice 
catherine it will be in in were to accuse him that her ladyship was quite well 
yesterday se'nnight 
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr fancy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt 
that it was not in the least never there should be any notice on either side 
and that lit were it must belong to mr fancy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance 
mr cotillions listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus 
a my dear mine elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the slope of your understanding 
but permit me to an that there must be a wide distance between the stab shed forms of ceremony amongst the dairy and those which regulate the clergy 
for give me leave to observe that i consider the medical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom 
provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the mine time maintained 
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictate of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty 
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself and with a low how he left her to attack mr dairy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was ve evident 
her cousin prepared his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt an if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words pride and prejudice 
i 
apology 1 “hunsford 2 and a lady catherine de bought it vexed her to see him ox himself to such a man 
mr dairy was even in with unrestrained wonder and when at last my calling allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility 
mr cotillions however was not discouraged from king again and mr careys contempt seemed ahunil’aeritly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight how and moved another way 
mr cotillions then returned to elizabeth 
i have no reason i assure us a said he broke dissatisfied with my reception 
5 day seemed much pleased with the attention 
he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the cow linen of saying that he was so well convinced of la ye catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily 
it was really a very handsome thought 
upon the whole i am much pleased with him as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bringing 
and the train of agreeable reflection which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane 
she saw her in ideas settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow 
and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingley’s two sisters 
her mother thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much 
when they sat down to appear therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other 
and deeply was she vexed to and that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucy freely openly and of nothing 10 pride and prejudice 
clue but of her expectation that jane would he soon married to mr singly 
— it wan an animating object and my bonnet seemed incapable of fate hue while enumeration the advantages of the match 
in being each a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the list points of aelfgratulation 
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection at much as she could do 
it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughter as jones marrying so greedy must throw them in the way of other rich men 
and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consider her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked 
it was necessary to make this circumstance in matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette 
but no one was lest likely than mr bonnet to and comfort in staying at home at any period of her life 
she concluded with many good wishes that lady faces might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it 
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother a words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper 
for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr day who sat opposite to them 
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical 
a what is mr dared to me pray that i should be afraid of him 
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing be may not like to hear a for heaven s sake madam speak owen 
what advantage can it be to you to old mr dairy -5 
— you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing 
pride and prejudice 
3 nothing that she could so however had any influence 
her mother would key of her views in the same intelligible bone 
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation 
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr dare though every glance convinced her of what she drew end 
for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably vexed by her 
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity 
at length however mrs bonnet ha no more to lay 
and lady lucy who had been long dawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken 
elizabeth now began to revive 
but not long was the interval of tranquillity 
for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the come my 
by many significant looks and silent entreaties dishes endeavour to revenge such a proof of come nuisance 
— but in vain 
mary would not understand em 
such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song 
elizabeth eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensation and she watched her progress through the several stanza with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close 
for ma on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another 
mary powers were by no means fitted for such a dim lay 
her voice was weak and her manner affected 
elizabeth was in agonies 
she looked at jane to see how she bore it 
but jane was very composedly talking to single 
she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of decision at each other and at dairy who continued how my arm mercy 
ever impenetrable sure 
she looked at her father to entered his interference lest mary should be in king all night 
he look the hint and when mary had wished her second song said aloud 
that will do exile well child 
you have delighted us long enough 
let the other young ladies have time to exist 
mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted 
and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her father's speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good 
others of the party were now applied to 
if i a said mr rolling a were so fortunate as to be able to ring i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air 
for i music as a very innocent desertion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman 
i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to 
the rector of a parish has much to do 
— 
in the first place he must make such an agreement for them as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron 
he must write his own sermons 
and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible 
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment 
l can not acquit him of that duty 
nor could i a think well of the man who should omit an occasion of resting in his respect towards any bad connected with the miss you and with a bow to 5 day be concluded his speech which had been men so loud as to be heard by half the room 
— any stared 
man smiled 
but no one looked more amused than 5 bent himself while his wife seriously commended mr pride and prejudice 15 calling for having taken so sensibly and observed in a half-whisper to la luck that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man 
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or linger success 
and happy did she think it for angles and her sister that same the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed 
that his two sisters and mr day however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her real dixons was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentlemen or the insolent miles of the ladies were more intolerable 
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement 
she was teased by mr cotillions who continued most persevering by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others 
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room 
he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it 
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening 
there was no arguing upon such a rejected 
she owed her greatest relief to her friend his local who often joined them and good-natured engaged mr éollins’s conversation to herself 
she was at least free from the licence of mr careys further notice 
though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak 
she felt it to be the probable l he 1806 pride and prejudice

my hum and her finger immeyopened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient m have the house to themselves 
they repulsed every attempt of my bonnet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party 
which we very likely relieved by the long patches of mr claim who was complimenting mr singly and his listen on the elegance of their entertainment 
and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their gusts 
dance said nothing at all 
mr bonnet in equal silence was enjoying the scene 
mr willingly and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other 
elizabeth preserved at my a silence as either an hum or mile singly 
and even die was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of a lord how tired i am 
a accompanied by a violent yawn 
when at length they are to take leave my bonnet wan most refusing civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longtown and addressed himself particularly to mr bringing to admire him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation 
mingled was all grateful pleasure and be readily engaged for taking the earliest up rarity of waiting on her after his return from low on whither he wan obliged to go the next day for a short time 
mrs bonnet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the c. w pride and prejudice 
10 house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherlield in the course of three or four months 
of having another daughter married to mr cotillions she thought with half certainty and with considerable though not a pleasure 
elizabeth was the least dear to her of her children 
and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was closed by mr bigger and netherﬁeld 
chasm iii 
he next day opened a new scene at longboum.. mr cotillions made his declaration in four 
having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of evidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which be supposed a regular pane of the business 
on finding mrs bonnet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words a may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning 
a before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprize mrs beaufet instantly answered 
oh dear 
— yes 
certainly 
i am sure lazy will be very happy 
i am sure she can have no objection 
come kitty i want you upstairs and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out 1803 rays no promise 
a dear madam do not go 
i beg will not go 
mr cotillions must excuse me 
he can me nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear 
i am going away myself a no no nonsense lazy 
i desire you will any where you are and upon elizabeth seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added a likely i insist upon your saying and hearing mr cotillions 
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction 
and a moment consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over us soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion 
mrs bonnet and kitty walked toil and as soon as they were gone mr cotillions began 
believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather odd to your other perfections 
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness 
but allow me to assure you that i have our respected mother s permission for this address 
our can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse 
however your natural delicacy may lead you to assemble 
my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken 
almost as soon as i entered the house i mingled you out as the companion of my future life 
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying 
and moreover for coming into herefordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did i 
the idea of mr calling with all his solemn course being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the pride and prejudice 
1800 short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued 
my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circummmoes like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish 
secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness 
and thirdly 
which perhaps i ought to have mentioned relied that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness 
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too i on this subject 
and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsfordabetween our pools at quadrille while mrs atkinson was arranging miss de gourgh’s footstool that she said our calling you must marry 
a clergyman like you must marry 
— chuse properly chuse a gentleman for my sake 
and for your 10 
let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way 
this is my advice 
find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hereford and i will visit her allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de cough as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer 
you will and her manners beyond nothing can describe 
and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite 
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony 
it remains to be told why my views were directed to longtown instead of my own height brood where i assure you there are many amiable sung women 
but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i lie pride and prejudice 
could not myself without resolving to cut 3 wife from among his daughter 
that the lost to them might be as little at possible when the melancholy event takes place 
which however an i have already aid mayst em for several em 
thiahaabeeumy motive my fair cousin and matter myself it will not think me in your esteem 
and now naming remain for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection 
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with 
and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per central which will not be your till after your mother s decease it all that you may ever be entitled to 
on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent 
and you my name yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are many a it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now 
a you are too hasty air a she cried 
a you forget that i have made no answer 
let me do it without further loss of time 
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me 
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them 
i am not now to learn a replied mr calling with a formal wives of the hand 2 that it is usual with young ladies to respect the address of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he burst a lies for their favour 
and that sometimes the refusal repeated a second or even a third time 
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long 
a upon my word air cried elizabeth a your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration 
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies pride and prejudice 
iii much young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their ha unless on the chance of being asked a second time 
i 
am perfectly serious in my rational 
you could not make 
i 
happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so 
nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would send me in every respect ill qualify for the situau'on.” were it certain that lady catherine would think so aid mr cotillions very gravely 
but i can not imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you 
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualiﬁcations.” 1 indeed mr cotillions all praise of me will be unnecessary 
you must give me leave to for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say 
i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise 
in making me the offer you must have raised the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and ma take possession of longtown estate whenever it far as without any self-reproach 
this matter may be considered therefore as really settled 
and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr cotillions thus addressed her a when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me 
though i am far from chusing you of cruelty at present because i know it m be the established custom of your sex to reflect a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character l l 2 ii

in tormenting a respectable man 
i would rather be the compliment of being believed sincere 
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible 
my feeling in every respect forbid it 
can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart you are uniformly charming 
cried he with an air of awkward gallantry 
and i am persuaded pride and prejudice 
i 13 that when sanctioned by the express authority of both is excellent parents my proposals will not fail of acceptable 15 such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew 
determine d that if he lx'rsialed in considering her repeated refusal as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and poetry of an elegant female 
this is 
5 cotillions was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love 
for mrs bonnet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast-room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection 
mr cotillions received and returned these felicitations with equal measure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfast given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character 
this information however startled mrs bonnet 
— she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him b protesting against his proposals but she dared not be love it and could not help saying so 
i 4 pride and prejudice 
but depend upon it mr calling the added 
that hazy shall be brought to reason 
i will speak to her about it myself directly 
she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest 
but i will male her know it 
a pardon me for interrupting you madam 1 cried mr cotillions 
but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for ha pine 
in the marriage state 
if therefore the actually persist in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity 
air on quite misunderstand me said mrs lent a armed 
a likely is only headstrong in such matters as these 
in everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived 
i will go directly so mr bonnet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh 
mr bonnet you are wanted immediately 
we are all in an a road 
you must come and make lazy marry mr ellis for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have larch mr flannel raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a usual unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication 
i have not the pleasure of understanding out a said he when she had finished her speech 
do what an you talking 1 of mr rolling and lazy 
lay declares she will not have mr cousins and mr cotillions begins to say that he will not have lizzy.” pride and prejudice 
has a and what am i to do on the occasion 
— it seems an ho less business a weak to lay about it yourself 
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him a let her be called down 
she shall hear my opinion mrs bonnet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library 
a come here child a cried her father as she appeared 
i have sent for you on an affair of importance 
i understand that mr cotillions has made you an offer of marriage 
is it true 
a elizabeth replied that it was 
very well 
and this offer of marriage you have raised 
a a i have sir 
very well 
we now come to the inn 
your mother insists upon your accepting it 
is it not so mrs bonnet g a a yes or i will never see her against an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth 
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your intents 
your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr cousins and i will never see you again if you 10 
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning 
but mrs bonnet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed 
a what do you mean mr bonnet by talking in this way 
you promised me to inn 
upon her marrying me 
my dear replied her husband a l have two small favours to request 
f first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion 
and secondly of my room 
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be 16 pride and prejudice not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs bonnet give up the point 
she talked to elizabeth again and again 
roared and threatened her by turns 
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest 
but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering 
and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks 
though her manner friend however her determination never did 
mr cotillions meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed 
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him 
and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way 
his regard for her was quite imaginary 
and the possibility of her deserving her mother reproach prevented his feeling any regret 
while the family were in this confusion charlotte faces came to and the day with them 
she was met in the vestibule 
a ladies who trying to her cried in a half whisper a am glad you are come for there is such fun here 
— 
what do you think has hasp bed this morning i 
mr cotillions has made an offer to say and she will not have him charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the urn news 
and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room where mrs blunt was alone than the likewise began on the subject calling on miss luck for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend hazy to complying with the wishes of all her family 
a play do my dear miss case a a she added in a melancholy tone 1 for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves 
charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth 
a aye there she comes continued mrs banners pride and prejudice 
x 17 looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way 
— but i tell you what miss lazy 
if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all 
and i am sure 1 do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead 
— i shall not be able to keep you 
and so i warn you have done with you from this very day 
— i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will send me as good as my word 
i have no pleasure in talking to dutiful clrildrcu 
— not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to anybody 
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking 
nobody can tell what i suffer 
— but it 
is always no 
those who do not complain are never pitied her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation 
she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr cotillions who entered with an air nor stately than usual and on perceiving whom the said to the girls now i do insist us no it that you all of you hold your tongues and let 5 cousins and me have a little conversation together 
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but louisa stood her ground determined to hear all she could 
and charlotte detained trust the civility of mr cotillions whose inquiries after herself f and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity raised herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear 
in a doleful voice mrs bonnet thus began the projected conversation 
oh mr cotillions

my conduct may i fear be objectionable in loving accepted my dominion from your daughter lips instead of your own 
but we an all liable to cut 
i have certainly man well through the whole affair 
my object has been to lean an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family 
andifmymmcrhas been at all reprehension here beg leave to apologise chat ii 
he discussion of mr collina'l offer was not nearly at an end and earth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feeling necessarily attending it and occasionally from name peeviah allusion of her mother 
a for the gentleman himself i feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarruemen or dejection or my trying to avoid her but by pride and prejudice 
he stillness of manner and resentful silence 
he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transformed for the rest of the day to miss local whose civility in listening to him was a reasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend 
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bonnets ill humour or in health 
mr cotillions was also in the same state of angry pride 
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it 
he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay 
after breakfast the girls walked to mention to inquire if mr twickenham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherﬁeld ball 
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody was well talked over 
to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence bad been self-imposed 
i found said he a as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr dry 
— 
that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself 
she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wicket and another officer walked back with them to longtown and during the walk he particularly attended to her 
his accompanying them was a double advantage 
she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother 
soon after their return a letter was delivered to 27 pride and prejudice miss bonnet 
it came from netherﬁeld and was opened immediately 
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot-pressed palm well covered with a lady s fair bowing hand 
and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages 
jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation 
but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wicked 
and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her upstairs 
when they had gained their own room jane taking out her letter said a this is from caroline singly 
what it contains has surprized me a good deal 
the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town 
and without any intention of coming back again 
you shall hear what she says 
she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in governor street where mr hours had a house 
the next was in these words 
i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in herefordshire except your society my dearest friend 
but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence 
i depend on you for that to these high-flown ox relations elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of disgust 
and though the suddenness of their removal surprized her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingley’s pride and prejudice 
in being there 
and as to the loss of their walked she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to leg it in the enjoyment of his 
a it is unlucky a said she after a short pause 2 that you should not he able to see your friends before they gave the country 
but may we not hope that the good of future happiness to which miss singly looks word may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters 
mr singly will not be detained in london by them caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into herefordshire this winter 
i will read it to on 
yes when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days 
but as we are certain it can not be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have denied on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in i comfortless hotel 
many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter 
i wish l could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the crowd 
but of that i desire 
i sincerely hope your christmas in herefordshire may bound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will he so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall d give you a a it is evident by this added jane 2 that he comes back no more this winter it is only evident that miss singly does not mean he should who will you think so 
it must be his own doing 
he is his own master 
but you do not know i. i i 2 1 pride and prejudice 
m. i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me 
i will have no reserves whom you 
mr mercy is impatient to see his sister 
and to confirm the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again 
i really do not think georgiana dairy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments 
and the affection she spies in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting 
from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister 
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject 
but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable 
my brother admires her greatly already 
he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing 
her relations all wish the connection as much as his own 
and at sister's partiality is not mistaking me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman heart 
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many 2 a what think our of -5 sentence my dear lazy 
2 is jane as she finished it 
2 is it not clear enough 
does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister 
that the is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference 
and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly 
to put me on my guard 
can there be any other opinion on the subject 2 1 yes there can 
for mine is totally different 
— will you hear it 2 a a most willingly 
a you shall have it in a few words 
miss singly sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him pride and prejudice 
2 to marry miss mercy 
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you 
jane shook her head 
indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection 
miss singly i am sure can not 
she is not such a simpleton 
could she have seen half as much love in mr fancy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes 
but the case is this 
we are not rich enough or grand enough for them 
and she is the more anxious to get miss fancy for her brother from the notion that when there has been an intermarriage she may have less trouble in arriving a second 
in which there is certainly some ingenuity and x dare say it would succeed if miss de bough were out of the way 
but my dearest jane you can not seriously imagine that because miss singly tells you her brother early admires miss mercy he is in the smallest degree ends sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend if we thought alike of miss single a replied jane 
your representation of all this might make me 33 
easy 
but i know the foundation is unjust 
line is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one 
and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself that is right 
you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine 
believe her to be deceived by all means 
you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer about my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere 2 1 24 pride and prejudice 1 you must decide for yourself a aid elizabeth 
and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two linger more than equivalent to the happiness being his wife i advise you b all means to refuse him a how can you talk so 
said jane fairly smiling 
you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate i did not think you would and that being the case i can not consider your situations with much compassion 
a but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required 
a thousand things may arise in six months 
2 the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt 
appeared to her merely the suggestion of cnrolinc’s interested witch and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one 
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing in happy effect 
james temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that single would return to netherlield and answer ever wish of her heart 
hey agreed that mrs bonnet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct 
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and the detailed it an exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting to intimate together 
after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that mr singly would be soon down again and soon pride and prejudice 
if dining at longtown and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had beenjnvited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses 
chapter 3 he bonnets were engaged to dine with the cases and again during the chief of the day was miss faces so kind as to listen to 5 cotillions 
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her 
a it keeps him in good humour a spirit she a and i am more obliged to you than i can express charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time 
this was very amiable but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of 
— its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of mr collins’s addresses by engaging them towards herself 
such was miss cases scheme 
and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night thus would have felt almost sure of success if he hurt not been to leave i-lcrtfordshirc so very soon 
but here she did injustice to the tire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longtown house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucy lodge to throw himself at her feet 
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise 
for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of as 
tuesday 
his reception however was of the most ﬂat126 run an my mind

and miss lucy who a him solely from the pure and did desire of an csmbliahnwnt cared not how soon that establishment were joined 
sir william and lady hum were speedily applied to for their consent 
and it was bestowed with a most alacrity 
mr calling s resent circumstances made it a most eligible match or their daughter to whom they could give little fortune 
and his facts of future wealth were exceedingly fair 
lady lucy began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had over excited lit-fore how many years longer mr bonnet was likely to live 
and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr cotillions should he in possession of the longtown estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st james 
the whole familyf‘in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion 
he younger girl s erred hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done 
and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte dying an old maid 
charlotte herself was tolerpride and prejudice 
2 abdy composed 
she had gained her point and had time to consider of it 
her relations were in general satisfactory 
mr calling to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable 
his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary 
but still he would be her husband 
without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object 
it was the only honourable provision jar well-regulated young women of small fortune and however certain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest reservation from want 
this reservation she had now obtained 
and at the age of twenty-seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it 
the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprize it must occasion to elizabeth bonnet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person 
elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her 
and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation 
she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr cotillions when he returned to longtown to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before my of the family 
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept within difficulty 
or the curiosity excited by his long shame burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love 
as he was to begin this journey too early on the narrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave-taking was formed when the ladies moved for the night 
and as bonnet with great politeness and cordiality mind how happy they should he to see him at longtown again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them 
28 pride and prejudice 
xiv dear madam he replied this invitation is part rely gratifying became it in what i have been hoping to receive 
and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as ponihle.” were all vanished 
and mr bonnet who could no means wish for no indeed a return immediately aid 
a but in there not danger of lady catherine tip approbation here my good air 
you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroneaa.” 1 my dear sir a replied mr cotillions i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking no material a step without her ladyship concurrence you can not be too much on your guard 
risk anything rather than her dioplczmire 
and if you and it likely to be mind by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly i home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence 
a believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention 
and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a mere of thanks for thin as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in herefordshire 
an for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not except my cousin elizabeth with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew 
all of them equally surprised to and that he meditated a quick return 
my bonnet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him 
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the other 
there was a solidity in his reflections pride and prejudice 1 29 which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion 
but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away 
miss lucy called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before 
the possibility of mr collins’s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two 
but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was con gently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of corn and she could not help crying out engaged to mr cotillions 
my dear charlotte 
i be 
he steady countenance which miss lucy had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach 
though as it was no more than she sex she soon regained her composure and calmly reap nod 
why should you be surprised my dear eliza 
— do you think it incredible that mr cotillions should be able to procure any woman good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you 2 1 but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness 
i see what you are feeling a replied charlotte 
you must be surprized very much surprised 
so lately as mr cotillions was wishing to marry you 
but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will satisfied with what i have done 
i am not romantic 30 pride and prejudice 
you know 
i never was 
i ask only a comfortable home 
and considering mr collim’a character connection and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him in as fair as my people can boat on entering the marriage started elizabeth quietly entered undoubtedly 
a 
and after an awkward pause they returned to the m of the family 
charlotte did not may much larger and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard 
it ma a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of to unsuitable a match 
the strangeness of mr college making two officers of marriage within three days wan nothing in corn ribbon of his 
being now accepted 
she had ways feel t that charlotte s opinion of matrimony wan not exactly like her own but she could not have in it possible that when called into action the wo d have sacrificed every better feeling worldly advantage 
charlotte the wife of mr cotillions wan a most humiliating picture 
— 
and to the pang of a friend distracting herself and sunk in her esteem wan added the dimming conviction that it was impossible for that 
friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen 
gib-put fill elizabeth wan sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what he had heard and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it when sir william lucy himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engaged to the family 
with many compliment to them and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter 
to an audience not merely wondering but incredulously 
for mrs bonnet with more perseverance than politeness protested he pride and prejudice 
13 
must be entirely milkmen 
and ladies always unguarded and often uncivil boisterous exclaimed 
a good lord 
sir william how can you tell such a story 
do not you know that mr cotillions want to marry lucy 
nothing lest than the complaisance of a courtier could have home without anger such treatment 
but sir william's good bread carried him through it all 
and though he begged ve to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing money 
elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her for knowledge of it from charles herself 
and en endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamation of her mother and sisters v the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which the was reading joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr cousins and the convenient distance of rumford from london 
mrs bonnet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great day while sir william remained 
but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent 
in the first place she persisted in believing the whole of the matter 
secondly she was very sure that mr cotillions had been taken in 
thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy t other 
and courtesy that the match might be broken of 
two inference however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief 
and the other that she herself had been barbarous used b them all and on there two on she principally we t during the rest of the day 
nothing could console and nothing appeared her 
or did that day wear out her 32 pride and prejudice 
resentment 
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month away before she could speak to sir william or my case without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter 
mr bonnet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort 
for it grasped him he mad to discover that charlotte lucy whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter 
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match 
but she said less of her astonishment than of her nearest desire for their happiness 
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable 
kill an indian were far from envying miss luck for 5 cotillions was only a clergyman 
and it affected them in no other way than at a piece of news to spread at 
mention 
lady lucy could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs bonnet the comfort of having a daughter well married 
and she called at longtown rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though mrs bonnet s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away 
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which he t them mutually silent on the subject 
and elizabeth et persuaded that no real come once could ever subsist between them again 
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose solitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose tardiness she grew daily more anxious as kindly had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return 
jane had sent caroline on early answer to her letter pride an d prejudice 
i 33 and was conducting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again 
the promised letter of thank from mr cotillions arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth s abode in the family might have prompted 
after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeds to inform them with many rapturous ox passions of his ha illness in having obtained the aﬂfcﬁon of their amiable fed neighbour bliss lungs and then explained that it was more with the view of enjoying her society that he had en so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longtown whither he ho to be able to return on monday fortnight 
for any catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men 
mr climes return into herefordshire was no longer a mixture of pleasure to mrs bonnet 
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband 
it was very strange that he should come to longtown instead of to lucy lodge 
it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome 
she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable 
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bonnet and they gave way on ye to the greater distress of mr singly s continued absence 
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject 
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly revelled in mention of his coming no more to the old the whole winter 
a report which highly increased mrs bonnet and which she never failed to contradict is a most scandalous falsehood 
i 34 pill de an d prejudice even elizabeth began to fear 
not that single wan indifferent 
but that he listen would be dreadful in keeping him away 
unwilling a the was to admit an idiot do defective of june happiness and to dimourlhle to the nobility of her lover the could not vent is frequently recurring 
the united effort of his two unfeeling finer and of his overpowering friend trained by the attractions of miss mercy and the amusement of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment 
all for jane her anxiety under thin was of course more painful than eliubeth’l kite whatever in felt the was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject wan never alluded to 
but as no such delicacy remained her mother an hour seldom lasted in which she did not talk of single express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come hack the should think herself very ill used 
it needed all jane's neatly miles to hear these attach with tolerable tranquillity 
mr cotillions returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his reception at longtown war not quite i gracious an it had been on hit lit introduction 
he was too happy however to need much attention 
and luckily for the others the business of leave-taking relieved them from a great deal of his company 
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucy lodge and he sometime returned to onghourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed 
mrs bonnet wan really in a most pitiable state 
the very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour 
and wherever she went she was sum of hearing it talked of 
the sight of miss case was odious to her 
as her succour in pride and prejudice 35 that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence 
whenever charles came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of aversion 
and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr cotillions was convinced that they were talking of the longtown estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughter out of the house as soon as mr bonnet were dead 
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband 
a indeed mr bonnet a said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucy should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for in and live to see her take my place in it 
a 
my clear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts 
let us hope for better things 
cut us after ourselves that i may be the survivor.” this was not very consoling to mrs bonnet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before 
i can not bear to think that they should have all this estate 
if it was not for the fail i should not mind it 
a what should not you mind 
i should not mind anything at all 
a let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility 1 i never can be thankful mr bonnet for anything about the nail how any one could have the conscience to detail away an estate from one s own a daughters i can not understand 
and all for the sake of mr cotillions fool 
why should be have it more than anybody else 
a i leave it to yourself to determine a said mr beaufet

chapter 1810 
1803 singly s letter moved and put an end to doubt 
the ve first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all ended in london for the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to hit friend in herefordshire before he left the country 
hope wan over entirely over 
and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter the found little except the porch affection of the writer that could give her any comfort 
miss careys praise occupied the chief of it 
her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the account banishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter 
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of mr careys house and mentioned with rapture some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture 
elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation 
her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all others 
to caroline assertion of her brothers being partial to miss fancy the is no credit 
that he was really fond of jane she mounted no more than she had ever done 
and much no she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that business of temper that want of proof 5 relolutionhwhich now made him the slave of his reigning friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations 
had his own happiness however 
been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best 
pride and prejudice 
37 but her interest was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself 
it was a subject in short on which rejection would be long indulged and must unavailing 
she could think of nothing else 
and yet whether bingley’s regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference 
whether he had been aware of lanes attachment or whether it had escaped his observation 
whatever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained the same her peace equally wounded 
a day or two passed before jane had courage to key of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs nests leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherﬁeld and its master she could not help laying 1 of that my dear mother had more command over herself i she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflection on him 
but i will not repine 
it can not last long 
he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulously solitude but said nothing 
you doubt me a cried jane slightly colouring 
indeed you have no reason 
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all 
i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with 
thank god 
i have not bill pain 
a little time therefore 
i shall certainly try to get the better with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to an one but myself 
a my dear jane 
a exclaimed elizabeth you are too good 
your sweetness and disinterested are i. s inn pride and prejudice 
really angel 
i do not know what to say to our 
i feel as if i had never done you justice or love you a you deserve 
man bent eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sister s warm affection 
a nay said elizabeth this is not fair 
thou wish to think all the world are table and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody 
i on my want to think you effect and you set yourself against it 
do not be a said of my running into any excess of my encroaching on our privilege of universal good-will 
you need not 
ere are few apple whom i really love and still fewer of whom think well 
the more i see of the world the more am i disaau'sﬁed with it 
and every day confirm my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense have met with two instances lately one i will not mention 
the other is charlotte's marriage 
it is unaccountable 
in every view it is unaccountable 
a my dear size do not give way to such feelings as these 
they will ruin your happiness 
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper 
consider mr collins’s respectability and charlotte s prudent steady character 
remember that she is one of a large family 
that as to fortune it is a most eligible match 
and be ready to believe for everybody sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin 
a to oblige you i would try to believe almost anything but no one else could be benumbed by such a belief as this 
for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart 
my pride and prejudice 
if dear jane mr cotillions is a conceited pompous narrow-minded silly man 
you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him can not have a proper way of thinking 
you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucy 
you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade myself or me that selfishness is prudence insensibility of danger security for happiness i must think our language too strong in king of ho 1 replied and 
2 and i hope you willfconvinoed of it by seen them happy together 
but enough of this 
you a alluded to something else 
you mentioned two instances 
i can not misunderstand you but i entreat you dear likely not to pain me by thinking that pen to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk 
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured 
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspection 
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that receive us 
women fancy admiration means more than it does 
and men take care that they should lift it is designedly done they can not be justified 
but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine 
a i am far from attributing any part of mr bingiey’s conduct to design a said elizabeth 
but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may misery 
thoughtlessness want of attention to other people feelings and want of resolution will do the business a and do you impute it to either of those 19 a yew 
to the last 
but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem 
stop me while 
you can 
no m and prrjiidici 
you then in opposing his sisters influence him i 
a yes in connection with his friends i can not believe it 
why should they try to influence him 
they can only wish his happiness 
mdifheisanac www.motherwomancan secure it a your lit portion is false 
they may wish many things besides his happiness 
they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence 
they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money got connections and pride a beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse in fancy a replied jane 
but this road be from better feelingthan you are supposing 
hey have known her much longer than they have known me 
no wonder if they love her better 
but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother 
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable 
if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us 
if he were so they could not succeed 
by supposing such an affection you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy 
do not distress me by the idea 
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken 
or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters 
let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood 
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr singly s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them 
mrs bonnet still continued to wonder and revenge at his returning no more and though a day seldom in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly pride and prejudice 
14 there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity 
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more 
but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day 
mrs bonnets best comfort was that mr singly must be down again in the summer 
mr bonnet treated the matter differently 
so lazy a said he one day a your sister is crossed in love i and 
i congratulate her 
next to being married a girl likes to he crossed in love a little new and then 
it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her come notions 
when is your turn to come 
will ha lybeartobelong outdone by i em now is our time here are a curs enough at error to say it all the young ladies in the country 
let widlfhoam be your man 
he is a pleasant fellow and would just you creditably 1 thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me 
we must not all expect jane s good fortune 
struck a said mr bonnet 
but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it mr wickham’s society was of material service in d fling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences thrown on many of the longtown family 
they w him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve 
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr dairy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed 
and its pride and prior 
everybody was eased to think how much they had always disliked 5 day before they had known anything of the matter 
bonnet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuation circumstances in the case unknown to the society of herefordshire 
her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes 
but by everybody else mr dairy was condemned as the wont of men 
chapter in 
after a week spent in profession of love and schemes of fidelity mr cotillions was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday 
the pain of separation however might be alleviation on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride 
as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into herefordshire the day you d be lived that was to make him the happiest of men 
he took leave of his relations at longtown with as much solemnity as before 
wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks 
on the following monday mrs bonnet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longtown 
mr gardens was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as endymion 
the netherﬁeld ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouse could have been so well-bred and greatly 
mrs gardeners who was several years younger than mrs bonnet and mrs hills was an porch and prejudice 
4 amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longtown nieces 
between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard 
they had frequently been staying with her in town 
the first part of mrs gardener s business on her arrival was to contribute her presents and describe the newest fashions 
when this was done she had a less active part to play 
it became her turn to listen 
mrs bonnet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of 
they had all been very ill-used since she hat saw her sister 
two of her his had been on the point of marriage and after a 
there was nothing in it 
i do not blame jane 1 she continued for jane would have got mr singly if she could 
but lazy 
oh sister 
it is very hard to think that she might have been mr cotillions s wife by this time had it not been for her own perverseness 
he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him 
the consequence of it is that lady lucy will have a daughter married before i have and that longtown estate is just as much entitled as ever 
the cases are very artful people indeed sister 
they are all for what they can get 
i am sorry to say it of them but so it is 
it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before an body else 
however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves 
mrs garden to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeth correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation 
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke in pride and prejudice more on the subject 
a it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane a mind she 
a i am worry it went off 
but the-achingsha soften 
a flung me such as you describe mr singly so easily all 
in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separated them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconnancies are very frequent 1 an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for in 
we do not under by accident 
it does not often happen that the interference of friend will persuade a young man of independent form to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before but that expression of violently in love it so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little in 
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour acquaintance an to a real strong attachment 
lady how bit 
we mr bingley’u love 
a i never now a more promising inclination 
he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her 
every time they met it was more decided and remarkable 
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not 
asking them to dance 
and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer 
could there be linger 5 puny 
is not general incivility the very existence of love i 
a oh yes i 
of that kind of love which i supposed him no have felt 
poor june 
i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately 
it had better have happened to you lay 
you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner 
but do you think she won d be prevailed on to go back with us 
change of scene might be of nice 
and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything pride and prejudice 
if elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sisters ready acquiescence 
a i hope added my garden 
that no consideration with regard to this young man will induce her 
we live in so different a rest of town all our connections are so different and you well know we a out so little that it is he improbable that they thou d meet at all unless he real ye comes to see her a and 15 is quite in blue 
for he is now in the custom of his friend an mr fancy would no more called him to call on jane in such a of london 
my dear aunt how could a think of it 
mr dairy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch study but he would hardly think a month s allusion enough to please him from its securities were he once to enter it 
and depend upon it mr singly never stir without him so much the better 
i hope that will not meet at all 
but does not jane correspond with his sister 
she will not be able to help calling 1 she will drop the acquaintance entirely but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this it as well as the still more interesting one of binglty’s being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless 
it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be estimated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s attractions 
miss bonnet 
accepted her aunt invitation with pleasure 
and the single were no otlrenvise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped by caroline not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him 
red pride and much 
the gardener played week at longtown 
and what with the phillipses the acute and the others there was not a day without it engagement 
man bent head to care fly provided for the enterninntent of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner 
when the engagement was for home come of the office always made part of it 
of which after mr wieltharn was sure to be one 
and on these occasion my garden rendered auspicious by elizabeth’warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both 
without supposing them from what she saw to be ve strictly in love their preference of each other was in enough to make her a little uneasy 
and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left herefordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment 
to mr gardener william had one mean 
of according pleasure unconnected with his general powers 
about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage the had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbythire to which he belonged 
they had therefore many acquaintance in common 
and though wick had been little there since the death of darcy’t father ever ears before it was yet in his power to go her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring 
my garden had seen duberley and known the late mr dry by character perfectly well 
here consequently war an inexhaustibesubject of discourse 
in comparing her recollection of duberley with the minute description which william could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late sense the was delighting both him and half 
on being made acquainted with the present mr dare s treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentlepride and prenticed 47 men reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was convent at last that she recollected having hard mr fitzwilliam dairy formerly spoken of as a very proud ill-natured boy 
bit aid 
as gardeners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone 
after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on 
you are too sensible a girl hazy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it 
and therefore i am not afraid of speaking of clay 
seriously i would have you be on your but do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent 
i have nothing to say a mist inches is a most interesting young man 
and i he had the mine he ought to have i should think or could not do better 
but as it is you must not et your fancy run away with you 
you have openly and we all expect you to use it 
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure 
you must not drop pint your father 
a my dear aunt this is being serious indeed ye and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise a well then you need not be under any alarm 
i will take care of myself and of mr richard too 
he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it a elizabeth you are not serious now 
a i beg your pardon i will try again 
at present i 48 pride and prejudice 
am not in love with mr wick 
no i certainly am not 
but be is beyond all comparison the most i able man i ever saw 
and he becomes really attached to me 
i believe it will better that he should not 
i see the imprudence of it 
oh 
be 
abominable mr dairy 
— my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it 
my father however is partial to mr twickenham 
in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you ha my 
but since we see a day that where there is a action lee loin withheld by immediate want omit entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow 
creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist 
all that i can i on therefore is not to be in a hurry 
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his rest when i am in comes g with him i will not be wishing 
in short i will’il‘b my best perhaps it will be as well if you discovery he his coming home so very often 
at least 
you she d not mind your mother of inviting him 
as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from all 
but do not imagine that he is always here so often 
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week 
you know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends 
but really an upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be the wisest 
and now i hope you are satisﬁed.” her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted 
a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented

49 mr cotillions returned into herefordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardeners and jane 
but as he took up in 
abode with the leaves his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bonnet 
his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length on far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to lay in an ill-natured tone that she a subject that might be happy 
thursday was to be the wedding ye and 
on wednesday miss lucy paid her farewell visit 
and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mother ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room 
as they went down stairs together charlotte mild 
lie shall depend on hearing from you very often he is

you certainly shells and i have another favour to ask 
will you come and see me i 2 we shall often meet i hope in herefordshire 1 i am not likely to leave sent for some time 
promise me therefore to come to hunsford.” elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit

indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set of

i found that miss dare was expected to dinner 
i wish i could see her 
my visit was not long as caroline and mrs hours were going out 
i dare say i shall soon see them here elizabeth shook her head over this letter 
it come vexed her that accident only could discover to mr singly her sisters being in town 
four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him 
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it 
but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley’s inattention 
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear 
but the shortness of her star and yet more the alteration of her manner would all now jane to deceive herself no longer 
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt 
a my dearest lazy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at m expense when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley’s regard for me 
but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my conscience was as natural as your suspicion

at if the same circumstances were to ha 11 again i am sure i should be deceived a akin

and though we know this nicety to duke needless yet if she feels it it will easily account or her behaviour to me

i can not but wonder however at her having any such fears now became if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago 
he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself 
and yet it should seem by her owner of talking as if he wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to in fancy 
i can not understand it 
if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there it a strong appearance of duplicity in all this 
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy 
your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt 
let me hear from you very soon 
miss singly said something of his never returning to netherﬁeld again of giving up the house but not with any certainty 
we had better not mention it 
i am extremely glad that you have such plants accounts from our friends at rumford 
pray go to see them with sir william and maria 
i am sure you will be very comfortable there 
— you can this letter gave elizabeth some pain 
but her spirit returned as the considered that jane would no longer be pride and prejudice 15 duped by the sister at least 
all expectation floor the brother was now absolutely over 
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions 
his character sunk on every review of it 
and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr careys sister as by wickham’s account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away 
mrs gardener about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information 
and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself 
his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else 
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain 
her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was mixed with believing that be would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it 
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable 
but elizabeth less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in charlotte s did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence 
nothing on the contrary could he more natural 
and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquishing her she was read to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both an could we sincerely wish him happy 
all this was knowledge to mrs gardener 
and after relating the circumstances she thus went on 
a i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love 
for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil 
but my feelings are not only cordial towards kin they are even impartial town s miss king 
i can not and out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least uncle l 4 pride and prejudice 
willing to think her a very good sort of girl 
there can be no love in all this 
my watchfulness has been effectual 
and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i did 
merely in love with him i can not say that i regret my comparative insignificance 
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly 
kitty and ladies take his affection much more to heart than i do 
there young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain 
chasm saw 
it no greater events than these in the longtown family and otherwise diverted by little beyond the walks to mention sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away 
march was to take elizabeth to hereford 
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither 
but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty 
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust 
of mr cotillions 
there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such companionably sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake 
the journey would moreover give her a sleep at jane 
and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay 
everything however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlotte's 1st sketch 
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter 
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan beware perfect as plan could be 
pride and prejudice 5 the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the it so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter 
the farewell between herself and mr william was perfectly friendly 
on his side even more 
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had no the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired 
and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bough and trusting their opinion of her 
their opinion of everybody 
would always coincide there was a solitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard 
and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and leading 
her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable 
sir william lungs and his daughter maria a good-humoured girl but as empty-headed as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise 
elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir william's too long 
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood 
and his civilities were worn out like his intimation 
it was a journey of on went for miles and they began it so early as to in racechnrch street by noon 
as they drove to mr gardeners door jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival 
when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever 
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerly for their cousin's appearance would not allow them 5 6 pride and prejudice 
to wait in the drawing-room and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower 
all was joy and kindness 
the day passed most pleasantly away 
the morning in haste and shopping and the evening at one of the creatures 
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt 
their first subject was her sister 
and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute inquiry that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were rid of objection 
it was reasonable however to open that they would not continue long 
mrs gardener gave her the particulars also of miss singly visit in gmcechurch street and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance 
mrs gardener then rallied her niece on wickham’s desertion and corn directed her on hearing it so well 
a but my dear elizabeth 4 the added what sort of girl it miss king 
i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary 1 pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial airs between the mercenary and the evident motive 
where does discretion end and avarice begin -5 last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent 
and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to and out that he is mercenary if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think a she is a very good kind of girl i believe 
i know no harm of her a but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers death made her mistress of this fortune a no 
why should he 
if it were not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money mobs and prejudice 
5 5 what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor 
a but there seems indelicacy in directing his attention towards her so soon after this event 
a a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorum which other pen lee ma observe 
if as does not object to it why should w g a her not 
objecting does not justify 32 
it only shows her being deficient in something herself 
sense or feel -5 well cried elizabeth 
have it as our choose 
he shall he mercenary and b shall be too she a no likely that is what i do not choose 
i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in devonshire 
oh 
if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in devonshire 
and their intimate friends who live in herefordshire are not much better 
i am sick of them all 
thank heaven 
i am going to-morrow where i shall send a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him 
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all 
take care lazy 
that speech favours strongly on intent before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer 
we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs gardeners but perhaps to the takes no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most lady and grateful 
me dear dear aunt she rapturously cried 
what de eight 
what felicity l you give me read life and vigour 
adieu to point 8 mot arm prejudice 
men and spleen 
what are men to stocks and mountains 
oh 
what hour trays it we shall spend 
and when we do return it i not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of anything 
we wo know where we have gone 
we wish recollect what we have seen 
takes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations 
nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation 
let our rate effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of mvellers.” chapter iii 
very object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to elizabeth 
and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment 
for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all ear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source a delight 
when they left the high road for the lane to hurtful every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view 
the paling of losing park was their bounded on one side 
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants 
at length the parsonage was discerning 
the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge everything declared they were arriving 
mr cousins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party 
in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing pride and prejudice 
19 at the sight of each other 
mrs cotillions welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received 
she saw instantly that her cousin manners were not altered by his marriage 
his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the ate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her arms my 
they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house 
and as soon as they were in the hour he welcomed them a second time with ostentation formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wife officers of refreshment 
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory 
and she could not help fancying that in i laying the good proportion of the room its aspect an 
its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him 
but though everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion 
when mr cotillions said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not seldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte 
once or twice she could discern a faint blush 
but in angel charlotte wisely did not hear 
after sitting on enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr follies invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and no the cultivation of which he attended himself 
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures 
and elizabeth admired the command of 16 pride can prejudice 
countenance with which charlotte talked of the halthfulneu of the exercise and owned the encouraged it at much at possible 
here leading the way through every walk and can walk and nearer allowing them an interval to utter the place be asked for every view we pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind 
he could number the field in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant plump 
but of all the very which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rousing afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house 
it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground 
from his garden mr cotillions would have led them round hit two meadows 
but the ladies not having thou to encounter the remains of a white frost 
turned back 
and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband 9 help 
all was rather small but well built and convenient 
and everything wan fitted up and arranged with a weakness and consistent of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit 
hen mr cotillions could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by charlotte's evident enjoyment of it elizabeth opposed he must be often forgotten 
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country 
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr cotillions dining in observed 
— yes miss elizabeth you wo l have the honour of seeing lady catherine de rough on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her 
she is all affability and concern and prejudice 
31 succession and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over 
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here 
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming 
we dine at prosings twice ever week and are never allowed to walk home 
her ladyship carriage is regularly ordered for us 
i shall say one of her ladyship carriages for she has several lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman in a added charlotte 2 and a most attentive neighbour a very true my dear that is exactly what i say 
she is the sort of woman whom one can not regard with too much deference the evening was spent chilly in talking over herefordshire news and telling again what had been already written 
and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte's degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and come sure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well 
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenour of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr cousins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rising 
a lively imagination soon settled it all 
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion 
and after listening a moment she heard somebody meaning upstairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her 
he opened the door and met maria in the leading place who breathless with agitation cried out 
a oh my dear eliza 
pray make haste and come 16 pride and pssjumcn 
into the dining-room for there is such a sight to be seen 
i will not tell you what it in 
make haste and come down this moment 
elizabeth asked questions in vain 
maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the dining-room which from the lane in quest of this wonder 
it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate 
and ll this all 
a cried elizabeth 
1 expected at least that the pangs were got into the garden and here it nothing but lady catherine and her daughter 
a a la 
my dear a said maria quite shocked at the mistake 1 it is not lady catherine 
the old lady is my jenkinsoo who lives with them 
the other it miss de bough 
only look at her 
she is quite a little creature 
who would have thought she could be to thin and small 
a a she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind 
why does she not come in it for charles yet she hardly ever does 
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bough comes in 
a i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas 
she looks sickly and cross 
yes she will do for him very well 
she will make him a very proud rwifc.” 5 cousins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies 
and sir william to elizabeth s high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bough looked that way 
at length there was nothing more to be said 
the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house 
mr cotillions no sooner saw the two girls than he to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at brings the next day 
pride and prejudice 16 put all 
5 collins’s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete 
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for 
and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough 
a i confess a said he 2 that i should not have been at all surprized by her ladyship asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at moorings 
i rather expected from in knowledge of her affability that it would happen 
lit who could have foreseen such an attention as this 
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after our arrival 
a a am the less so revived at what has happened 1 replied sir william a room that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire 
about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon scarce anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to prosings 
mr cotillions was carefully instruction them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them 
when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth 
a do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparent 
lady catherine is farm ready run an prejudice 
quitting that elegance of drains us which come here and daughter 
i would advise you merely to put 
on whatever of your clothes in upon to the rent 
there in no occasion for anything more 
lady catherinewillnotthinktheworleofyouforbein imply dreaded 
she liked have the distinction of rank renewed 
while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different door to recommend their being quick an lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner 
such formidable account of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucy who had been little need to county and she looked forward to her introduction at cling with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st james s 
all the weather was line they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park 
every park bank in beauty and it prospects 
and elizabeth raw much to he pleased with though he could not he in such rapture as mr cotillions expected the scene to inspire and war but lightly affected by his enumeration of the window in front of the house and hit relation of what the glaring altogether had originally cost sir lewis c bough 
when they ascended the steps to the hall maria's alarm was every moment increasing 
and even sir william did not look perfectly calm 
elizabeth’courage did not fail her 
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary tall or mrraculoua virtue and the mere uatelineu of money and rank the thought the could witness without trepidation 
from the entrance-hall of which mr cotillions intend out with a rapturous air the one proportion and indeed omarnenta they followed the servant through an neptune and pnmumcn 
run chamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs atkinson were sitting 
her lady with great condescension arose to receive them 
an as mrs cotillions had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of t sex apologies and thanks which he would have thought my 
in spite of having been at st james sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his sent without saying a word 
and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses hat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look 
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly 
— lady catherine was a tall large woman with strongly-marked features which might once have been handsome 
her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank 
she was not rendered formidable by silence 
but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self-importance and brought mr twickenham immediately to elizabeth mind 
and worn the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented 
when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr dairy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in marriage astonishment at her being so thin an so small 
there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies 
miss de fourth was pale and sickly 
her features though not plain were insignificant 
and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs 16 pride and prejudice 
kensington in whole appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what the maid and placing a scream in the proper direction before her eyes 
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the window to admire the view mr calling attending them to point out its beautiful and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer 
the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the tenants and all the article of plate which mr calling had promised 
and an he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table he her lad ships desire and looked at if he felt that i could with nothing greater 
he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity 
and every dish was commended rest by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever he son-in-law aid in i manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear 
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave tom gracious mile especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them 
the party did not apply much conversation 
elizabeth war ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she war seated between charlotte and miss de bough 
the former of whom wan engaged in listening to lady catherine and the letter said not a word to her all dinner-time 
man mention war chiefly employed in watching how little in de bough ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing the was disposed 
maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire 
when the ladies returned to the drawing-room there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intention till coffee came pride and prejudice 
16 in desiring her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment constrained 
she inquired into charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as so the management of them all 
told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry 
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others 
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs cotillions she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs cotillions was a very genteel pretty kind of girl 
she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mother made name 
— 
elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly 
— 
lady catherine then observed a your father s estate is entitled on mr cotillions i think 
for your sake a turning to charlotte 1 i am glad of it 
but otherwise i see no occasion for entering estates from the female line

but i suppose you had no opportunity 
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters 
a my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london 1 has your governess left you 2 2 we never had any governess 
no governess 
row was that possible 
five daughters brought up at home without a governess 
i never heard of such a thing 
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case 
a then who taught you 
who attended to you 
without a governess you must have been neglected 1 compared with some families i believe we were 
but circle of us as wished to learn never wanted the means 
we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary 
those who chose to be idle certainly might 
a aye no doubt 
but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one 
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it 
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way 
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out 
four nieces of mrs atkinson are most delightfully situated through my means 
and it was but the rum my prejudices 
16 other day that i recommended another young person who wan merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her 
my calling did i tell you of lad metcalfe’s calling yesterday to thank me 
she finds his pope a treasure

what all over out at once 
very odd l 
and you only the second 
the younger ones out before the evil her are married 
your younger sisters must be very young 
a yes my youngest is not sixteen 
perhaps as is full young to be much in company 
but really ma'am i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the man or inclination to marry early 
the last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first 
and to be kept hack on m a motive 
i think it would not he very bitter to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind upon my word a said her ladyship 1 you give your opinion very decidedly for so young 3 person 
ray what is your age 9 1 with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it 
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer 
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to tried with so much dignified impertinence 
you can not be more than twenty i am sure 
therefore you need not conceal your age 1 i am not one-and-twenty when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was i. m 
v i wo pride and prejudice 
over the card-tables were placed 
lady catherine sir william and mr and as cotillions sat down to quadrille 
and as miss de bough chose to play at casino the two girls had the honour of admire on atkinson to make up her any 
their was superlativer t is 
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not me to ten the game except when my atkinson expressed her fears of miss de bough being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light 
a great deal more awed at the other table 
lady catherine was general ye speaking 
stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself 
mr cotillions was employed in agreeing to everything her lad ship said thanking her for every she he won and apron giving if he thought he won too many 
sir william did not say much 
he was stopping his memory with anecdotes and noble names 
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as chose the tables were broken up the carriage was a bred to mrs cotillions gratefully accepted and immediately ordered 
the party then gathered round the free to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow 
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach 
and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collects side and as many bows on sir william's they d rated 
as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at prosings which for charlotte's sake she made more favourable than it really was 
but her commendation though closing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr cousins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship praise into his own hands 
pride and prejudice

i william played only a week at rumford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably rattled and of her possessing such a hundred and such a neighbour us were not often met with 
while sir william w with them mr cotillions devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country 
but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to and that that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in riding and writing and looking out of window in his own houseroom which fronted the road 
the room in which the ladies at was backwards 
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use 
it was a better prized room and had a pleasanter aspect 
but she noon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what the did for mr cotillions would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had sat in one wall lively 
and she gave charlotte it for the meggemyenl d from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr calling for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially mine de bough drove by in her plan which he never failed coming to inform them of thou oh it happened almost every day 
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out 
very few day 
passed in which mr cotillions did not 
2 pride and pkbjudici’ 
walk to rings and not may in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise 
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to he of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours 
new and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits 
she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently 
found fault with the arrangement of the creature or detected the housemaid in negligence 
and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of sending out that mrs collins’l joints of meat were too large or her family 
elizabeth soon perceived that though thin great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county the was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr cotillions 
and whenever any of the cottagers were diet be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she called forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty 
the entertainment of dining at rating was repeated about twice a week 
and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card-table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first 
their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinsea’ reach 
this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough 
there were half-hour of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of ear that she had often great enjoyment out of doors 
idle favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on pride and prejudice 
1791 lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity 
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away 
easter was approaching and the week yin-“needhg it was to bring an addition to the family at a which in so in circle must be moment 
elizabeth had heard noon after her arrival that mr dairy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rings parties and she might be unused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley’s designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admission and seemed almost an ray to and that 
he had already been frequently seen by is lungs and herself 
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage 
for mr cotillions was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into rumford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence 
on the following morning he hastened to rising to ay his respects 
there were two nephews of lady otherwise to unite them for mr dairy had brought with him a and fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord 
— and to the great surprize of all the party when mr cotillions returned the gentlemen accompanied him 
charlotte had seen them from her husband's room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding 
4 pride and preju‘dlcl‘ 
a i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility 
mr party would never have come to soon to wait upon me elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaimed all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door-bell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room 
colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in a and address most truly the gentleman 
mr e. looked as he had been used to look in herefordshire 
paid hit compliments with his usual reserve to mrs cousins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure 
elizabeth merely conveyed to him without saying a word 
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man and talked v pleasantly 
but his cousin after having addressed delight observation on the house and garden to my calling sat for some time without speaking to anybody 
at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family 
she answered him in the usual way and after a momentary pause added 
— a my eldest sister has been in town these three months 
here you never happened to see her there 
a she was perfectly sensible that he never had 
but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the being loyal and jane and she thought he looked a little con no he answered that he had never been so fortunate as so meet miss bonnet 
the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away 
pride and prejudice -5 that passes 
colonel f itzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at prosings 
it was some days however before the received an invitation thither 
for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary 
and it was not till yesterday almost a week after the gentleman's arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening 
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter 
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr day they had only seen at church 
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour the lined the party in lady catherine's drawing-room 
her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else 
and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to carry much more than to any other person in the more 
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them 
an thing was a welcome relief to him at prosings 
and collins’s hetty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much 
he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of rent and herefordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before 
and they conversed with so much spirit and now as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr dairy 
his eyes had been -5 5 my arms and tumbled 
soon and repute turned towards them with a look of curiosity 
and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple c to call out 
“whatisthat you are g fitzwilliam 
what is it you are talking of 
flat are you telling miss bonnet 
let me hear what it is a we are speaking of music madam 1 aid he when no longer able to avoid a reply 
of music 
then pray open aloud 
it is of all subjects in delight 
i must have my share in the conversation i you are speaking of music 
there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste 
if i had ever lamp i should have been a great proficient 
and so would anne if her health had allowed her to a sly 
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully 
how does georgiana get an dairy 
mr dairy spoke with affectionate of his sister's proficiency 
i am very glad to hear such a good account of her a mind lady catherine 
and pray tell her from me that she can not expect to excel if she does not practise a great dead i assure you madam 1 he replied that she does not need such advice 
she practised very constantly 
a so much the better 
it can not be done too much 
and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect 
it on any account 
i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be an altered without constant practice 
i have told miss next several times that she will never plays really well unless she practised more 
and though as cotillions has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to prosings every day and play on the pianoforte run

and to my certain knowledge more than one thing lady was sitting down in want of a partner

31 elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to one while my cousin and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor 
i she had heard no carriage the thought it not unlikely to he lady catherine and under that apprehension wan putting away her half-ﬁnished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr dairy and mr fancy only entered the room 
he seemed vanished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within 
they then sat down and when her inquiries after rising were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence 
it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting bank she had seen him last in herefordshire 
and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their last departure the allowed 
a how ever and only you all quitted nethcrﬁeld last november 5 dairy 
it must have been a most agreeable prize to mr angles to lee you all after him to noon 
for if i recollect right he went but the day before 
he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london to a perfectly in i thank you mobs and prejudice 
3 she found that she was to receive no other answer and after 3 short pause added 
a i think i have understood that mr singly has not much idea of ever returning to netherﬁeld a in i a i have never heard him an so 
but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future 
he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing 1 if he means to be but little at netherﬁeld it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we mr hat possibly get i settled family there 
but perhaps 5 bring did not take the house so much for the convenience office neighbourly as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same prince ere i should not be surprised a said fancy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase oﬂ'erl.” elizabeth made no answer 
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend 
and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him 
he took the hint and soon began with a this seems a very comfortable house 
lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr cotillions worst came to hunsford.” i believe she did 
and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object 
a mr cotillions appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife a yes indeed 
his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him ha ay if they had 
my friend has an excellent understand sing 
though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr calling as the wisest thing she ever did 
she seems is pride and prejudice 
perfectly happy however 
and in a prudently light it in certainly a very good match for her 
it number very agreeabletohertobenettled within so only a dance of her own family and friend a an enemy dining do you call it 
it is nearly fifty mile ... 2 and what is fifty miles of cod road 
little more than half a day's journey 
as i call it a very easy distance a i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantage of the match cried elizabeth 
a i should never saw laid my calling was settled near her family -5 a t in a proof of your own attachment to herefordshire 
anything beyond the very neighbourhood of longtown i suppose would appear far as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood 
he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherﬁeld and she blushed as the answered 
i do not mean to any that a woman may not be ended too near her family 
the far and the near must he relative and depend on many varying circumstances 
where there it fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil 
but that in not the case bare 
mr and my calling have a comfortable income but not such a one at will allow of frequent joumeys-and i am shaded my friend would not call herself near her family ye under less than bay the present distance 
mr dairy drew his chair a little towards her and aid a tap can not have a right to such very strong local attachment 
you can not have been always at low turns he both looked surprized 
the gentleman experipride and prejudice 
31 ended some change of feeling 
he drew back his chair took a new apart from the table and glancing over it said in a coax her voice 
a are you pleased with bent 
a a short dialogue on the subject of the county ensued on either side calm and concise 
and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk 
the main surprized them 
mr dairy reach the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bonnet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody went away 
what can be the meaning of this 
said charlotte as soon as he was gone 
a my dear eliza he man be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar ways but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlotte's wishes to be the case 
and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do which was the more probable from the time of year 
all old sports were over 
within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard-table but gentlemen can not be always within doors 
and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this kind of walking thither almost every day 
they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes to other and now and then accompanied by their aunt 
was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more 
and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george twickenham 
and 1814 pride and prejudice 
though in comparing them all law there was less captivating oftener in colonel fitzwilliam’l manners 
she believed he might have the heat informed mind 
but why mr dairy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand 
it could not be for society an he frequently last there ten minutes together without opening his lips 
and when he did break it adorned the effect of necessity rather than of choice 
a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself 
he seldom appeared really animated 
mrs cotillions knew not what to make of him 
colonel fitzwilliam’s occasionally lane ring at his stupidity proved that was generally i event which her own knowledge of him could not have told her i and an the would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she set herself seriously to work to and it out 
she watched him whenever they were at roaring and whenever he came to hereford 
but without much success 
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable 
it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind 
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea 
and mrs cotillions did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment 
for in her opinion it admitted not of doubt that all her friend s dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power 
no her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes leaned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam 
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man 
he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible 
name and prejudice 
18 but to counterbalance these advantages mr dairy had considerable pathos in the church and his cousin could have none at l 
chili 
ﬁﬁﬁlll more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the rock unexpectedly meet mr dairy 
she felt the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to meat in ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunts of hers 
how it could occur a second time therefore 
was very odd 
yet it did and even the third 
it seemed like wilful ill-nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a new formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought 
it necessary to turn back and walk with her 
he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much 
but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions 
about her pleasure in being at hunsfnrd her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr and mrs collins’s happiness 
and that in speaking of rising and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into went again she would be staying that too 
his words seemed to imply it 
could he have colonel fitzwilliaml in his thoughts 
she supposed if he meant anything he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that after 
it distressed her a little and she was quite l to and herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage 
she was engaged one day as she walked in 
pausing i. 5 1806 pride and prejudice 
james last letter and dwelling on some page which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprized by mr dairy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was seeing her 
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a mile she aid i did not know before that you ever walked this way i have been making the tour of the par 1 he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage 
are you going much farther 
a no i should have turned in a moment 
and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together 
do you certainly leave kept on saturday 2 said she 
yes 
if dairy does not put it off again 
but i am at his disposal 
he arrange the business just as he pleases 2 and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice 
i do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy.” 1 he likes to have his own way very well a replied colonel fitzwillianl 
but so we all do 
it is only that he has better man of having it than many others because he is rich and many other are poor 
i speak feelingly 
a younger son you know must benumbed to self 
denial and dependence in my iron the younger son of an earth can know very life he of either 
now seriously what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence 
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for 
ears me some 
18 1 these are home questions 
and perhaps i can not say that l have experienced many hardships of that nature 
but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money 
younger sons can not marry where they like unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do 
a our habits of expense make us too dependent and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money 2 is this a thought elizabeth meant for me i 
and she coloured at the idea 
but recovering herself aid in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an early younger son -5 unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped to interrupt a silence which might make him face her affected with what had passed she soon after 5 said 
a i imagine your cousin brought you down with him cried for the sake of having somebody at his disposal 
i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind 
but perhaps his sister does as well or the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her a no said colonel f william that is an advantage which he must divide with me 
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss mercy 
a are you indeed 
and pray what sort of guardians do you make 
does your charge give you much trouble 
young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficulty to manage and if she has the true dairy spirit she may like to have her own way 
as the spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly 
and the manner in which he immediately asked 1803 pride and rnuunrcr 
her why ill 
suppose mite dairy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that oh had somehow or other pretty near the truth 
she directly replied 
a on need not be frightened 
i never hard any harsher 
and i dare aayaheiloneofthe moor tractable creature in the world 
she it a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance my husband miss singly 
i think i have heard you lay that you know them 
i know them a little 
their brother l 
a pleasant gentlemanlike man 
he is a great friend of days 
robin ear said elizabeth dryly 
a mr fancy it uncle my kind mr bigger and takes a prodigious deal of are of him 
came of him l 
yes i really believe dairy la take care of him in those points where he coat want care 
from something that he told me in our journey hither i have run to think singly very much indebted to him 
but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that single was the person meant 
it wan all conjectured that it it you mean 
a it is a circumstance which dairy of course could not wish to be really known because if it were to round to the lady family it would bear unpleasant thing 
a oh may depend upon my not mentioning it and remember that i have not much reason for opposing it to be bigger 
what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particular are and i only suspected it to be bigger from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer pride and frijudicil 1810 did mr dairy give you his read for this interference 
a a i understood that there were some very strong objection against the lady 
and what am did he use to separate them 
he did not talk to me his own arm a maid fitzwilliam smiling 
a he only told me what i have now told a made no newer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation 
after watching her a little fitzwilliarn asked her why the was so thoughtful 
i am thinking of what you have been telling me said he 
a your cousin conduct done not quit my feeling 3 
why was he to he the judge 
a a on are rather disposed to call him interference opinion 
i do not see what right mr dairy had to decide on the propriety of hit friendly inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend wan to be happy 
but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him 
it in not to be supposed that there war much affection in the care 2 that in not an unnatural surmise 2 is f william but it is lessening the honour of my cousin triumph ve sadly fulfil was spoken feelingly 
but it appeared to her no just a picture of mr fancy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matter 
till they reached the parsonage 
there but into her own room an noon an their vision left them the could think without interruption of all that he had heard 
it was not to be supposed that any other people could he meant than thou with whom the way connected 
its pride and prejudice 
there could not exist in the world in men over whom mr dairy could have such groundless influence 
that he had been concerned in the means taken to operate mr bigger and jane the had never doubted 
but the had always attributed to mind bringing the principal design and arrangement of them 
if his own unite however did not mislead him be was the cause hit pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had killed and still continued to utter 
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the room 
affectionate generous heart in the world 
and no one could my how lasting an evil he might have inflicted 
there were some very strong objection against the lady a were colonel fitzwilliam’n word 
and these rung objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in bring in london 
a to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection 
all loveliness and goodness i the is 
her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manner captivating 
neither could anything be urged against my father who though with mine peculiarities 7th abilities which mr dairy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach 
when she thought of her brother indeed her confidence gave wary a little 
but would not allow that any objection her had material weight with mr dairy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the went of importance in his friends connections than from their want of sense 
and she was quite decided it but that he had been partly governed by this went kind of wide and partly by the with of retaining mr bit key or his sister

hen they were gone elizabeth ll if intending to exasperate herself a much as 
he against mr dairy chose for her em torment the examination of all the letter 
which one had written to her since her being in kept 
they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present covering 
but in all and in almost every line of each there wan a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characters her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at came with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded 
elizabeth noticed every sentence convey age the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it hardly received on the first perusal 
mr careys shameful bout of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her cetera iuil'eringa 
it was come consolation to think that till visit to robbing was to end on the day after the next 
and a still greater that in less than a night he should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do 
she could not think of days leaving kept with 
6 pride and prejudice 
out remembering that his cousin was to go with him 
but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him 
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door and her fits were a little hurried by the idea of its being cup one fitzwilliarn himself who had once before coals red late in the evening and might now come to inquire particularly after her 
but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently acted when to her utter amazement she saw mr dairy walk into the room 
in a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better 
she answered him with cold civility 
he t down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room 
elizabeth was surprized but said not a word 
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began 
a in vain have i struggled 
it will not do 
my feelings will not be dressed 
you must allow me to tell on how prudently admire and love you elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression 
she stared coloured doubted and was silent 
this he considered sufficient encouragement 
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed 
he spoke well 
but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more also got on the subject of tenderness than of pride 
is sense of her inferiority 
of its being a degradation 
of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with s warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his shut 
pride and prejudice 
7 in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive 
till roused to resentment by his.snl frequent language she lost all corn station in anger 
she tried however to compose horse f to answer him with patience when he should have done 
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer 
and with pressing his ho that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand 
as he said this she could equal see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer 
a spell of a profession and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security 
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said 
a in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequalled they run he returned 
it is natural that obligation should be t and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you 
but i can not 
i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly 
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one 
it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration 
the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this ox plantation 
5 day who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprize 
his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature 
he was struck pride and prejudice going for the alps assurance of composure and would not of no his lips till he believed himself to have attained it 
he pause was so elizabeth s feelings dreadful 
at length in a voice of forced calmness he said 
2 and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting 
i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little mar at civility i am thus rejected 
but it is of small importance 1 i might as well inquire 1 replied she a why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will a against your reason and even against your character 
as not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have other provocations 
you know i have 
had not my own feelings decided against you 
— had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister 2 a a as she pronounced these words mr day changed colour 
but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued 
i have every reason in the world to think ill of you 
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted bare 
you dare not you can not deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and stability the other to its permission for disappointed ho s and involving them both in misery of the act kind 
she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse 
he even looked at her with s smile of affected incredulity 
a can you deny that you have done it 
a she repeated 
pride and prejudice 9 with assumed tranquillity he then replied a i ham no wish of denying that i did everything in in power to separate my friend from our sister or that rejoice in my success 
towards i have been kinder than towards myself 
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflections but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her 
a but it is not merely this impair 1 she continued a on which my dislike is founded 
long before it had taken place my a notion of you was decided 
your character was no bad in the recital which i received many months ago from mr twickenham 
on this subject what can you have to say 
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself 
or under what misrepresentation em you here impose upon others 2 
you take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns said dairy in a less tranquil tone and with a hair fastened colour 
a ho that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him 
his misfortunes 
repeated dairy contemptuously 
eyes his misfortunes have been great indeed 
and of your inspection 1 cried elizabeth with energy 
a you he reduced him to his present state of poverty 
comparative poverty 
you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him 
you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert 
you have done all this 
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridiculing land this a cried dairy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me his is the estimation in which you hold me 
i thank you to pride and prejudice 
for explaining it so fully 
my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed 
but 
perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her 
a these offences might have been over asked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design 
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my strong legs and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination 
by reason by selection by everything 
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence 
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related 
they were natural and just 
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections i 
w congratulate myself on the ho of relations whose condition in life is so decide my beneath my own 
a elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment 
yet she tried to the utmost to speak with come sure when she said 
— a on are mistaken mr fancy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner 
a she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued 
a you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it again his astonishment was obviously 
and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification 
she went on 
a from the very beginning 
from the first moment i my almost say 
of my acquaintance with you your manners impression me with the fullest belief of your pride and prejudice 
ll arrogance your conceit and your relish disdain of the feelings of others 
were such as to form that groundwork of relation on which succeeding events hue built so immovable i dislike 
and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the in man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to m i 
on have said quite enough madam 
i really comprehend your feelings and have now of ye to be ashamed of what my own have been 
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and ha press 
and with these words he has my left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the home 
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great 
she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half-hour 
her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it 
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr dairy 
that he should have been in love with her for so many months 
— so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister and which must appear at least with an force in his own case 
was almost incredible 
it was gratified sing to have inspired unconsciously so strong an a none 
but his pride his abominable pride 
his lameness avowal of what he had done with respect to jane 
his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr twickenham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempt tend to deny soon overcame the city which the cold moon of his attachment had in a moment excited 
she continued in very agitating reflections 12 pride and prejudice 
till the sound of lady catherine's carriage made her feel how one wall she was to encounter charlotte's observation an hurried her away to her room 
than 
7th 
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes 
she could not yet recover from the surprize of what had happened 
it was impossible to think of anything else 
and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise 
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr careys sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike-road 
the park paling was still the country on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground 
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the unpleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the rock 
the cave weeks which she had now passed in end had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees 
she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a gloom she of a gentleman within the sort of grove which led the park 
he was moving that way 
and fearful of its being mr dairy she was directly retreating 
but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepped forward with eagerness pronounced her name 
he had moved away 
but on hearing herself called 
though in a voice my ma 5 
-5 pride and prejudice 
13 which proved it to be mr dairy she moved again towards the ate 
he had by that time reached it also and hold in out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you 
will you do me the honour of reading that 
letter 
2 and then with a slight how turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight 
with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still-increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper written quite through in a very close hand 
the envelope itself was likewise full 
pursuing her way along the lane she then began it 
it was dated from prosings at eight o'clock in the morning and was as follows 
a be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any rev notion of those sentiments or renewal of those offers w such were last night so disgusting to you 
i write without any intention of praising you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the ha illness of both can not be too soon forgotten and the s on which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been red had not my character required it to be written an read 
you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention 
your things i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice 
a two offences a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge 
the last-mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr singly from your sister 
and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity 14 rays arm snowed 
ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospect of mr twickenham 
will and wanted to ve thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence m on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would he a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks 
could bear no comparison 
out from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall ho to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read 
if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry 
the necessity must be obeyed and further apology would be absurd 
i had not been long in herefordshire before i saw in common with others that single preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country 
but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherﬁeld that i had any a reception of his feeling a serious attachment 
i had of ten seen him in love before 
at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william cases accidental information that bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their meaning 
he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided 
from that moment i observed my friends behaviour‘attentively 
and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bonnet was be and what i had ever witnessed in him 
your sister also watched 
her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced pride and prejudice 
15 from the evenings scantily that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment 
if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error 
your superior knowledge he of your sister must make the latter probable 
— if it so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable 
but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer 1 conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched 
that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain 
but i will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears 
i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it 
— i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason 
my directions to the marriage were not merely those which last night acknowledged to have required the utmost fame of passion to put aside in my own case 
the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me 
but there were other causes of repugnance 
— causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances had myself endeavoured to do et because they were not immediately before me 
these causes must be stated though briefly 
the situation of your mother family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that tour want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformity betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father 
pardon me 
it pains me to offend you 
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less 16 mum and prejudice 
generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both 
i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection 
he left netherﬁeld for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning 
the tart which i acted is now to be explained 
his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own 
our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london 
we accordingly went 
and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice 
i described and enforced them eagerly 
but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimate have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister indifference 
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard 
but singly has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own 
to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point 
to persuade him against returning into herefordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment 
i can not blame myself for having done thus much 
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not respect with satisfaction 
it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art no far as to conceal from him your sister being in town 
i knew it myself as it was known to miss singly 
but her brother is pride and prejudice 
is even et ignorant of it 
that they might have met without i l consequence is perhaps probable 
but his did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger 
perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me 
it is done however and it was done for the best 
on this subject have nothing more to say no other apology to offer 
if i have wounded your sister feelings it was unknowingly done 
and though the motives which governed me my to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them 
a with respect to that other more eighty accusation of having injured mr wicked i can only refute it by laying fire on the whole of his connection with my family 
of what he has singularly accused me i am ignorant 
but of the true of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity 
a 5 william is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the embers estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his most naturally inclined my father to be of service to him 
and on george wick who was his bosom his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed 
my father supported him at school and words at cambridge 
most irnpommt assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman education 
my father was not only fond of this young man's society whose manners were always engaging 
he had also the highest a union of him and hoping the church would be his proof sessions intended to provide for him in it 
as for myself it is many many years since i art began to think of him in a very different manner 
the vicious propensities-the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best use a 11 
l 8 pride and prejudice 
friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in an unguarded moments which mr dairy could not have 
here again i shall give you pain 
to what degree you onlydcan tell 
but whatever may be the sentiments which 5 wicked has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character a dust even another motive 
a my excellent father died about live years ago 
and his attachment to mr william was to the late so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow 
and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant 
there was also a licence of one thousand pounds 
his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr twickenham wrote to inform me that having morally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not 
think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the performed by which he ca d not be renewed 
he had some intention he added of study age the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support thereon 
i rather wished than believed him to be sincere 
but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal 
i knew that mr twickenham ought not to be a clergyman 
the business was therefore soon settled 
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds 
all connection between us seemed now dissolved 
i thought too ill of him to invite him to duberley or admit his society in town 
in town i believe he cried lived but his pride and predict 
19 studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation 
for about three years i heard little of him 
but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation 
his circumstances he assured me and 1 had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad 
he had than the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question 
of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my reveries father s intentions 
you will hardly blame me for refusing to complying with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it 
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances 
and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me so others as in his reproaches to myself 
after this not every appearance of acquaintance was dropped how he lived i know not 
but last summer he was again most painfully obtained on my notice 
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfolded to any human being 
having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy 
m sister who is more than ten years my junior was led to the guardianship of my mother s nephew colonel fitzwillinm and myself 
about a year a she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london 
and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate 
and thither also went mr twickenham undoubtedly by design 
for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs young in whose character we were most unhappily deceived 
and by her control pride and prejudice 
advance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement 
she was then but after which must be her excuse 
and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself 
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked it to as a father acknowledged the whole to me 
you may imagine what i felt and how acted 
regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure 
but i wrote to mr twickenham who left the place immediately and mrs younger was of course removed from her charge 
mr wickham’s chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune which is thirty thousand pounds 
but i can not help supposing that the hope of evening himself on me was a strong inducement 
his revenge would have been complete indeed 
this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together 
and if you do not absolute reflect it as false you will i hope acquit me hence north of cruelty towards mr twickenham 
i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you 
but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either 
detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination 
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night 
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed 
for the truth of everything here related i can appeal pride and prejudice 
2 
more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliarn who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the execution of my father will has been unavoidably a united with every particular of these transactions 
i your abhorrence of in 
should make in assertions valueless you can not be prevented by the same cause from come no in my cousin 
and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to and some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning 
i will only add god bless you 
a finwruusm damp 
cast ﬁﬁﬁhj 
f elizabeth when mr day gave her the letter i did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents 
but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrary of emotion they excited 
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined 
with amazement did she burst understand that he believed any apology to be in his power 
and steadfast was she persuaded that he on d have no explanation to ice which a sense of shame would not come 
with a strong prejudice against everything he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherﬁeld 
she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension 
and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes 
his belief of her sister s sensibility she instantly resolved to be false 
and his account of the real the worst objections 32 hale and prejudice 
to the match made her too angry to have any with of doing him justice 
he expressed no regret for what he had done which raised her 
his style was not penitent but haughty 
it was all pride and insolence 
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr twickenham 
when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow ever cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so a ring an ability to his own history of himself 
her feeling s were yet more acutely painful and more difficulty of decision 
astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her 
she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming 1 this must be false this can not be 
this must be the crosses falsehood 
— and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that the would never look in it again 
in this performed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on 
but it would not do 
in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wicked and commanded herself to far as to examine the meaning of ever sentence 
the account of his connection with the embers family was exactly what he had related himself 
and the kindness of the late mr dearly though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words 
so far each recital confirmed the other 
but when she came to the will the difference was great 
what william had said of the king was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other 
and for a few moments the flattered herself that her wishes did pride and prejudice 
23 not err 
but when she read and retreated with the closest mention the particulars immediately following of wickham’s resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum ll three thousand pounds again was the forced to hesitate 
she put down the letter weighs every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality 
deliberate on the probability of each tenements 
but with little success 
on both sides it was only assertion

but every line proved more clearly the affair which she had believed it i be that any contrivance could to represent as to anger dairy s conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a urn which must make him entirely blameless throughout die whole 
the extravagance and general privacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr icltham’s chair exceedingly shocked her 
the more so as she to 1 
bring no roof of its injustice 
she had never heard of him for his entrance into the 
shirts militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance 
of his former way of life nothing had been known in herefordshire but what he told himself 
as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of in airing 
his countenance voice and manner had stab wished him at once in the possession of every virtue 
she tried to collect some instance of goodness some distinguished tract of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr dairy 
or at least by the predominated of virtue atone for those canal errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr dairy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance 
but no such recollection befriended her 
she could see him instantly before her in every charm 14 ran arm predict

and at last the no referred for the truth of every to colonel f william himself 
from whom the end previously received the information of his our concern in all his couriu’a affairs and whose character he had no reason to nation 
at one time the had almost resolved an apple sing to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr fancy would never have handled such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin corroborating 
she perfectly remembered everything that had in conversation between wicket and her in their first evening at mr phillipa'a 
many of his expreaaioru were still fresh in her memory 
she wan new luck with the impropriety of inch communication to a stranger and wondered it had stamped her before 
she law the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his profession with his conduct 
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr dairy 
that mr fancy might leave the country but that be should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherﬁeld ball the very next week 
she remembered also that till the netherlield family had quitted the country he had told his nay to no one but herself 
but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed 
that he had then no deserve no temples in thinking mr careys character pride and prejudice 
25 thou ah he had assured her that he cut for the father you d always prevent his exposing s son 
how differently did everything now a year in which he was concerned i his attentions to bliss king were now the consequence of views solely and carefully mercenary 
and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eager to group at anything 
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive 
he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed s 2 had more cautiously shown 
every spring struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter 
an in farther uttiﬁcation of mr dairy she could not but allow that i kindly when questioned by jane had 10 ago asserted his carelessness in the affair 
that person and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance 
an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his waye-eeen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust 
anything that spoke him of religious or moral habits that among his own connections he wan esteemed and valued 
that even william had allowed him merit as brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionate of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling 
that had hit actions been what twickenham represented them so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world 
and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr singly was incomprehensible 
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself 
of neither dry nor richard could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd

mr fancy only for a few minutes to take leave 
but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour groping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found 
elizabeth could but all concern in missing him 
she really rejoiced at it 
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object 
she could think only of her letter

dance of their appalling in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so loser gone through at roi‘lllgl 
to prosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her days her 
and on his return brought back with great stir action a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her 
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece 
nor could she think without a smile of what her lawyer ships indignation would have been 
what would she have said i 
how would she have behaved 
were questions with which she amused herself their first subject was the diminution of the rising army 
i assure on i feel it exceedingly said oddly catherine 
a believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do 
but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me 
they were excessively to go 
but so they always are 
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last 
but day seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year 
his attachment to prosings certainly increases mr cotillions had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter 
lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bonnet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added 
a but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer 
mrs cotillions will be very glad of your company i am sure a i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind pride and prejudice 29 invitation 1 replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept in i must be in town next saturday 
who at that rate you will have been here only six weeks 
i expected you to stay two months 
i told mrs calling so before you came 
there can he no occasion for your going so soon 
mrs bonnet could certainly spare out for another fortnight 
but my father can not 
he wrote last week to hurry my return 
2 the 
your father of course may spare you if your mother can 
daughters are never of so much consequence to a father 
and if you will et another mull 
complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week 
and as down does not object to the barouche 
box 
there will be very good room for one of you 
and indeed if the weather should ha to be cool i should not object to taking you ho as are neither of you large you are all kindness madam 
but i believe we must abide by our original plan 
lady catherine seemed resigned 
a mrs cotillions you must send a servant with them 
you know i always speak my mind and i can not hear the idea of two long women travelling post by themselves 
it is high improper 
you must contrive to send somebody 
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing 
young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life 
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two tenements go with her 
miss fancy the daughter of mr dairy of duberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner 
i am excessively attentive to all those things

31 manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil 
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and ladies 
but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence what chance could there be of improvement 
catherine weak-minted irritable and completely under lists guidance had been always affronted by their advice 
and ladies self-willed and careless would scarcely give them a hearing 
they were ignorant idle and vain 
while there was an office in morton they would hurt with him 
and while morton was within a walk of longtown they would be going there for ever 
anxiety on panels behalf was another prevailing concern 
and mr careys explanation by restoring angles to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost 
his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his conscience in his friend 
how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for ha press jane had been deprived by the folly and in economy of her own family 
when to these recollections was added the development of william s character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost i be for her to appear tolerate cheerful 
heir engagements at prosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first 
the very last evening was spent there 
and her ladyship again inquired mine into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought her pride and prejudice 
self obliged on her return to and all the work of the morning and pack her trunk fresh 
when they planned lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hereford again next year 
and miss de bough exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both 
that a 33 
a saturday morning elizabeth and mr cotillions met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared 
and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary 
i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs cotillions has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us 
but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it 
the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you 
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode 
our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestic and the little we see of the world must make rumford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself 
but i hope you all believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness 
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment 
and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her feel the obliged 
mr cotillions was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied 
— sung and prejudice 
33 1 it vex me the test leisure to hear that have passed your ring 
not liiisagreeably 
we hazy certain ye done our best 
and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to superior society and from our connection with rings the f vent means of varying the humble home scene i thin we may latter ourselves that your rumford visit can not have been entirely irksome 
our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast 
you see on what a footing we are 
you see how continually we are engaged there 
in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one bidding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at prosings words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings 
and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences 
a you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into herefordshire my dear cousin 
i better myself at least that you will be able to do 50 
lady catherine's great attentions to mrs cotillions you have been a daily witness of 
and altogether i trust it does not a air that your friend has drawn an unfortunate out on this point it will be as well to be silent 
only let me assure you my dear mist elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordial wish you equal felicity in marriage 
my dear chair one and i have but one mind and one way of thinking 
there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us 
we seem to have been designed for each other elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity 1 
c 34 pride and prejudice our old that the army believed and rejoiced in his tlurrreutic comfort 
she war not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the led from whom they sprang 
poor charlotte 
it war me rrnehnly to leave her to such society but she had broken it with her eyes open 
and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to struck far companion 
her home and her housekeeping 
her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concern had not yet lost their charm 
at length the chuckle arrived the truth were fastened an the parcel placed within and it was pronounced to be ready 
after an affectionate parting between the ii‘iendi elizabeth we attended to the carriage by mr pulling ring on they walked down the garden he was enmmiuionin her with his best respects to all her family nut forgetting hit thanks for the kinder he hurt received at longtown in the winter and hit compliments to mr errand mirror gardener though unknown 
life then turned her in maria followed and the door we on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of losing 
a but he added a you will of course wish to have your humble respect 
delivered to them with your grateful than a for their kindness to you while you have been here 
elizabeth made no objection 
the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off 
a good gracious 
cried maria after a few minutes' silence a it seems 
but a day or two since we worst came l 
-and yet how many things have happened 
a a great many indeed a said her companion with a sigh 
we have dined nine times at prosings besides drinking tea there twice 
how much i shall have to tell 
pride and prejudice 
elizabeth privateer added and how much i shall have to conceal l 1 their 
journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm 
and within four hours of their leaving rumford they reached mr gardener s house where they were to remain a few days 
jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them 
but jane was to go home with her and at longtown there would be leisure enough for observation 
it was not without an effort mean while that she could wait even for longtown before she told her sister of mr careys rocks 
to know that she had the power of revel in what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to a etc as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she would communicate 
and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of single which might only grieve her sister further 
gibson *ﬂﬁlﬁt was the second week in may in which the three i young ladies set out together from gmcechurch street for the town of 
in herefordshire 
and as they drew near the appointed inn when mr bonnets carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachman punctuality 33 kitty and ladies looking out of a dining-room upstairs

a what do you think 
it it excellent new 
capital new 
and about a certain person that we all like i a jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not nay 
ladies laughed and said 
says that ll just like your formality and discretion 
you thought the waiter must not hear at if he cared 
i dare lay he often hears worse things said than i am going to say 
but he is an ugly fellow l i am glad he it gone 
i never saw such a long chair in my life 
well but now for my news 
it is about dear william 
too god for the waiter in not it 
there in no danger of ickham’s marrying mary king 
there a for you i she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay 
wicket in safety 2 and mary king is safely 
added elizabeth 
a safe from a connection imprudent an to fortune a she is a great fool for going away if she liked him a but i hope there ll no strong attachment on either side a said jane 
a i am sure there is not on mr 
i will answer for it he never cared three raw about her 
who can about such a nasty little checked thing 
a elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of german herself the coarseness of the judgment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal 
as soon an all had ate and the elder one paid the carriage was ordered 
and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes work-bags and freely and the unwelcome addition of kitty and deal purchases were seated in it 
a how nicely we are framed in a cried india 
38 pride and prejudice 
a i am glad bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox i well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home 
and in the first place let us hear what happened to you all since you went away 
have you seen any pleasant men 
have you had any parting 
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back 
jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare 
she is almost three-and-twenty lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three-and-twenty my aunt philip wants you so to get husbands you can think 
she says lazy had better have taken mr cotillions 
but i do not think there would have been any fun in it 
lord 
how i should like to be mankind before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls 
dear me 
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel oysters 
kitty and me were to spend the day there and mrs forever remained to have a little dance in the evening 
by t s by mrs faster and me are rut friends 
and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself 
and then what do you think we did 
we dressed up chamberlayne in woman s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady 
only think what fun i not a soul knew of it but colonel and mrs faster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns 
and you carrot imagine how well he looked 
when henry and wicket and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least 
lord 
how i laughed 
and so did mrs forswear 
i thought would have died 
and but made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter 
with such kind of histories of their parties and good pride and prejudice 39 jokes did india assisted by kitty hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longtown 
elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham’s name 
their reception at home was most kind 
mrs bonnet rejoiced to see june in diminished beauty 
and more than once during dinner did mr bonnet say voluntarily to elizabeth 
i am glad you are come back lizzy.” their party in the dining-room was large for almost all the leaves came to meet maria and hear the news 
and various were the subjects which occupied them lady case was in airing of maria across the table after the welfare an poultry of her eldest daughter 
mrs bonnet was doubly engaged 
on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who eat some way below her and on the other detailing them all to the younger miss license 
and lying in a voice rather louder than any other person was enumeration the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her 
a oh 
mary a said she a i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun 
as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach 
and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick 
and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsome for we treated the other three with the nicest cox d nuncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too 
and then when we came away it was such fun 
i thought we never should have got into the coach 
1 was ready to die of laughter 
and then we were so merry all the way home 
we talked and laughed so loud that anybody might have heard us ten miles of 
a 40 pride and prejudice 
to this mary very gravely replied a far be it from me my dear sister to appreciate such pleasures 
they would doubtless be convenient with the generality of female minds 
but i confess they would have no charms for me 
i should infinitely prefer a book 
but of this answer india heard not a word 
she seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all 
in the afternoon i. die was urgent with the lest of the girls to walk to eton and see how everybody went on 
but elizabeth steadily applied the scheme 
it should not be said that the miss sonnets could not be at home half a day before they were in suit of the officers 
there was another reason too or her opposition 
she dreaded seeing richard again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible 
the comfort to turn of the regiment s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression 
in a fortnight they were to go 
and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to argue her on his account 
he had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lying had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents 
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding 
but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last 
shoulder all 
elizabeth impatience to acquaint jane with 
what had happened could no longer be overcome 
and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and pride and prejudice 
4 parting her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr dairy and herself 
miss bonnets astonishment was soon lessened by the strain sisterly partiality which made any admiration of eliza this appear perfectly natural 
and all surprize was shortly lost in other feelings 
she was sorry that mr dairy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them 
but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him 
a his being so sure of succeeding was wrong a said she and certainly ought not to have appeared 
but consider how much it must increase his disappointment 
a a indeed a replied elizabeth 
i am heartily sorry for him 
but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me 
you do not blame me however or refusing him in a blame you 
oh no 
a but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wick 
no 
i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did a but you evil know it when i have told you what happened the very next day 
he then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george twickenham 
what a stroke was this for poor jane 
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual 
nor was careys vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery 
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other 
a this will not do said elizabeth 
a you never 42 pride and prejudice 
will be able to make both of them good for anything 
take our choice but you must be satisfied with on my one 
here is but such 3 quantity of merit between them 1 just enough to rule one good sort of man 
and of late it hill been shifting about prey much 
for my part i am inclined to believe it all 5 careys 
but you shall do as you chuse it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane 
a i do not know when i have been more shocked a said she 
“wickhsm so very bad 
it is almost past belief 
and poor mr dairy 
dear lazy only consider what he must have suffered 
such a disappointment and with the knowledge of our ill opinion wool and having to relate such a thing of his sister 
it is calmly too distressing 
i am sure you must feel it is 
oh 
no my regret and compassion are all done own by seeing you so full of both 
i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent 
your profusion makes me saving 
and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather 
poor william 
there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance 
such an openness and gentleness in his manner 
a there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men 
one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it i never thought mr day so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do 
and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason 
it is such a spur to one genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind 
one may be comprise and prejudice 43 finally alive without saying anything just 
but one can not be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty 
eliza when you first read that later i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now 
a indeed i could not 
i was uncomfortable enough 
i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy 
and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had 
oh 
how i wanted you i a a how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of william to mr dance for now they do appear wholly undeservedly a certainty 
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural confuse fence of the prejudices i had been encouraging 
here is one point on which i want your advice 
i want to be told whether i eight or ought not to make our acquaintance in gone understand wickham’s character 
a miss bonnet paused a little and then replied a surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully 
what is your own opinion 
2 that it ought not to be attempted 
mr dairy has not authorized me to make his communication public 
on the contrary every particular relative to is sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself 
and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me 
the general service a not mr mercy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in mention to attempt to place him in an amiable light 
i am not equal to it 
wicked will soon be gone 
and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is 
some time hence it will be all found out 
a then we may laugh at 
their stupidity in not 44 my arm prejudice 
knowing it before 
at present i will say nothing about it 
you are quite right 
to have his errors rude public might ruin him for ever 
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re-establish a character 
we must not make him desperation the tumult of eliulx'th’s mind was delayed by this conversation 
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighs on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in june whenever she might wish to talk again of either 
but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure 
she dared not relate the other half of mr dairy s letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend 
here was knowledge in which no one could partake 
and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of m story 
2 and then said she a if that very improbable et event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what brings ma tell in a much more agreeable manner himself 
he liberty of communication can not be mine till it has lost all its value 
a she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sister s spirits 
jane was not happy 
she still cherished a very tender affection for singly 
having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of rest attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than laura attachments often boast 
and so frequently did she value his rcmembmnee and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity 
pride and prejudice 
45 a well lay a said mrs bonnet one day a what in your opinion now of this sad business of lanes 
for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody 
i told my deter philip on the other but i can not find out that jane saw anything of him in london 
well he is a very undeserving young man 
and i do not suppose there in the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now 
there is no talk of his coming to netherﬁeld again in the manner 
and i have inquired of everybody too who is likely to know a i do not believe that he will ever live at netherﬁeld any more a oh well 
it ll as he chooses 
nobody wants him to come 
thou oh i shall always say that he used my daughter extreme ye ill 
and if i wan her i would not have put i with it 
well my comfort is i am cure jane will he of a broken heart 
and then he will be sorry for what he has done but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer 
well lazy continued her mother soon afterwards and no the collinsen live very comfortable do they 
well well i only hope it will last 
and what sort of table do they keep 
charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say 
if she is half as sharp an her mother she is saving enough 
there in nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare nay a no nothing at all a great deal of good management depend upon it 
yes yes 
7th will take care not to outrun their income 
till 
will never be distressed for money 
well much good may it do them 
and so i suppose they often talk of having longtown when your father i dead 
they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happened 46 pride and prejudice 
a it was a subject which they could not mention before me no 
it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves 
well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better 
i should be ashamed of having one that was only entitled on me chapter 1 
he first week of their return was soon one 
the second began 
it was the last of the regiment my at eton and all the young ladies in the neighbours were dropping apace 
the dejection was almost universal 
the elder miss bonnets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employment 
very frequently were the reproached for this insensibility by lofty and india whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family 
good heaven what is to become of us 
what are we to do 
a would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe 
how can you be smiling so lazy 
a their affectionate mother shared all their grief 
she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago 
i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel miller regiment went away 
i thought i should have broke my heart a i am sure i shall break mine said india

such were the kind of lamentation desponding perpetually through longtown home

she felt anew the justice of 5 dance objection 
and never had he before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the view of his may the 31 5 india reaped am -5 cow s i i veal cleared away 
for she received and invitation from mr

if you my dear father will not omit far pride and prejudice 
49 take the trouble of checking her exuberance spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuit are not to be the business of her life she will soon be on the reach of amendment 
her character will be read and the will at sixteen be the most determined dirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous 
— 
a dirty too in the worst and meant degree of irritation 
without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person 
and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite 
in this danger kitty in also comprehended

wherever you and jane are known you must be respect and valued 
and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of

we shall have no peace at longtown if india does not go to brighton 
let her go then 
colonel forswear is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief 
and ill 
is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody 
at brighton the will be of less importance even as a common girl than the has been here 
the officers will and women better worth their notice 
let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance 
at any rate he can not grow many degrees worse without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life ii 
d 50 pride and prejudice 
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content 
but her own opinion continued the some and the left him disappointed and sorry 
it was not in her nature however to increase her vexation by dwelling on them 
she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety 
was no part of her disposition 
mind india and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility 
in ladies imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness 
she saw with the relative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathingplace covered with officers 
she saw herself the object or attention to tens and to scream of them at present unknown 
she saw all the glories of the damp 
its lent a stretched forth in beauties uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and darling with scarlet 
and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tenth tenderly flirting with at least six occurs at once 
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from each prospects and we reality as these what would have been her sensations 
they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same 
ladies going to brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself 
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed 
and their rapture continued with little intermission to the very day of ladies leaving home 
elizabeth was now to see 5 wicked for the last time 
huvingbeen frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over 
the agitation of former partiality entirely so 
she had even learnt to defect in the very gentleness which had first delighted pride and prejudice 
31 her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary 
in his present behaviour to herself moreover the had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon received of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their so maintenance could only serve after what had time past to provoke her 
he lost all concern for him in finding feel thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry 
and while she readily repressed it could not but feel the roof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal 
on the very last day of the regiment s remaining at person he dined with others of the faces at longtown 
and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his taking some inquiry as to the manner in which her time he at rumford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam’s and mr days having both spent three weeks at musings and asked him if he was acquainted with the former 
he looked surprized i pleased alarmed 
but with a moment recollection and 
returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often 
and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man asked her how she had liked him 
her answer was wanting in his favour 
with an air of indifferent he soon afterwards added 
a how long did you say that he was at prosings 
a a nearly three weeks 2 and you saw him frequently

3 elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a bright inclination of the head 
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him 
the rest of the evening passed with the nectarwt on his side of usual cheerfulness but w further attempt to distinguish elizabeth 
and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again 
when the party broke up india returned with mrs f created to person from whence they were to let out early the next morning 
the relation between her and her family wan rather noisy a pathetic 
kitty was the only one who shed tears 
but she did week from vexation and envy 
mrs bonnet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressions in her injunctions that the would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible 
— advice which there was every reason to believe would he attended to 
and in the clamorous happiness of india herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard 
silent i133ad elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort 
her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their put an end to all real nﬁ‘eetion for her

talents which rightly used mull lit least have preserved the mapcctability of his daughter even if incapable of entering the mind of hit wife 
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham’c departure the found little other cause for satisfaction in the hum of the regiment 
their parting abroad were let varied than before and at home she had a mother and lines where comment repining at the palm of everything around them threw a real gloom over their plans and prejudice 
as domestic circle 
and though kitty might in time in her natural degree of sense since the distress of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a a cap 
upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking alice bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself 
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity 
to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment 
her tour to the lake was now the object of her happiest thou hats 
it was her best consolation for all the unsuitable hours which the discontent of her mother and kitty made inevitable 
and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect 
but it is fortunate a thought she 2 that i have something to wish for 
were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain 
but here my carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised 
a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful 
and general disappointment is only worked off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation 
when india went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty 
but her letters were always long expected and always very short 
those to her mother contained little else than 6 pride and prejudice 
that the were returned from the library where such on such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild 
that she had i new gown or a new l which she would have described more full was obliged to leave i 
in a violent hurry as is forever called her and they were going to the damp 
and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to he leant 
for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the word 
to be made public 
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerful begun to appear at longtown 
everything wore a happier cut 
the families who had been in town for the water came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose 
mrs bonnet was restored to her usual credulous serenity 
and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter morton without tears 
an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should be uttered in morton 
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight hat only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from a garden which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent 
mr gardener would be prevented b business from setting out till a fortnight later in june ye and must be in london again within a month 
and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see to much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lake and substitute a more contracted pride and prejudice 
so tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than devonshire 
in that cow there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks 
and to my garden it had a peculiarly strong attraction 
the town where he had formerly pane some can of her life and where they were now to spend a cows do a was probably as great an object of her curiosity as l the celebrated beauties of rock charmouth overtake or the pack 
elizabeth was excessively disappointed 
she had set her heart on seeing the lake and still thought there might have been time enough 
but it was her business to be hailed 
and certainly her temper to be happy 
and all was soon right again with the mention of derby-hire there were many ideas connected 
it was in be for her to see the word without thinking of mercy and its owner 
but surely a said she a i may enter his county with purity and rob it of a few period aparwithout hit perceiving me the period of expectation was now doubled 
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt arrival 
but they did pass away and mr and my garden with their four children did at length appear at longtown 
the children two girl of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the clear care of their cousin jane who was the gentle favourite and who read come and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way 
teaching them playing with them and loving them 
the garden preyed only one i hot at longtown and set off the next morning with a quiet in purity of novelty and amusement 
one enjoyment wan certain 
that of suitableness an cox anxious 
a suitableness which comprehended health an temper to bear incomes pride and prejudice 
sentence 
chcerfulncu to enhance every pleasure 
and affection and intelligence which might iii lay it among themselves if there were disappointments a road 
it is not the object of this work to give a dozen iron of devonshire nor of any of the remarkable see through which their route thither lay 
obey lantern garrick wentworth birmingham c are sufficiently known 
a small part of devonshire is all the present concern 
to the little town of ambition the scene of mrs gardener s former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the count 
and within five much of compton elizabeth found room her aunt that ll -mbcrlcy was situated 
it was not in their diet roll nor more than a mile or two out of it 
in talking over their route the evening before mrs gardener expressed an inclination to see the place again 
mr gardener declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation 
my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much 
a said her aunt 
a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected 
wicked passed all his youth there you now elizabeth was distressed 
she felt that she had no business at duberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it 
she must own that she was tired of great houses 
after going over so many she really had no pleasure in one carpet or satin curtains 
s garden abused her stupidity 
a if it were merely a one house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself 
but the grounds are delightful 
they have some of the nest woods in the country 
elizabeth said no more 
but her mind could not pride and prejudice 
9 acquiesce 
the possibility of meeting mr day while viewing the place instantly occurred 
it would he dreadful 
she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk 
but against this there were objection 
and the rally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private inquiries us to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered 
accordingly lay when she retired at night she asked the chamber whether duberley were not a ve line place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer 
a most welcome negative followed the last question 
and her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself 
and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a part her air of indifference that she had not really any dislike c to the scheme 
— to duberley therefore they were to go 
14th 31 
elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of duberley woods with some perturbation 
and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high butter 
the park was very large and contained great variety of ground 
they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent 
elizabeth mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point so pride and prejudice 
of view 
they gradually ascended for inlf-a-mile and then found themselves at the top of a ooon'derable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by duberley home with on the opposite side of a valley into which the mad with tom about ten wound 
it wan a large handsome atone built long standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of him in woody hills 
and in front a stream of some unnatural in rtancewaa swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance 
it 
baker neither formal nor falsely adorned 
elizabeth was delighted 
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste 
they were all of them warm in their admiration 
and at that moment the felt that to be mine of duberley i hit be something 
they descended the hill created the bridge and drove to the door 
and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehension of meeting in owner returned 
she dreaded lest the chamber maid had been mistaken 
on applying to see the lace they were admitted into the hall 
and elizabeth m they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was 
the housekeeper came 
a respectable-looking elderly woman much lean one and more civil than the had any notion of binding her 
they followed her into the dining-parlour 
it was a large well-proportioned room handsomely fitted up 
elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect 
the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object 
every disposition of the ground was good 
an she looked on the whole scene the river the tree 
muttered on it back and pride and prejudice 
6 
the winding of the valley is for as she could trace it with delight 
as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different position 
but from every window there were beauties to be seen 
the rooms were lofty and handsome end their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gouty nor useless line 
with less of s labour and more real elegance than the furniture of losing 
and of dili‘jlice thought she a i might have been inn with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted 
instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and sunk 
but no 
— recollecting herself 
that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me 
i should not have been allowed to invite them 
this was a lucky recollection 
it saved her from something like regret 
she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent but had not courage for it 
at length however the question was asked by her uncle 
and she turned away with alarm while mrs records replied that he was adding a but we expect allen to-morrow with a large ay of friends how he paced was elizabeth that 5 own journey had not my any circumstance been delayed a day l her aunt now called her to look at a picture 
she approached and saw the likeness of mr william suspended amongst several other miniatures over the master ice 
her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the curve of a young gentleman the son of her late master s stern who had been brought up by him at his own expense 
he is now gone into 2 the army she added 
but i am afraid he has turned out ve wild mrs garden looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not mum it 
and that said my records pointing to another of the miniatures 2 is my master 
and we like him 
it was drawn at the same time as the 2 5 
about eight years ago 
a i have heard much of your master s line laid mrs gardener looking at the picture 
it in a handsome face 
but lazy you can tell us whether it is like or not 
mrs reynold’s respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master 
a does that young lady know mr dairy 
a elizabeth cox cured and laid 
a a little and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman 
modern -5 1 yes very handsome i am sure i know none so handsome 
but in the gallery upstairs you will see a sneer larger picture of him than this 
this room was my late master favourite room and these miniatures are just as they turned to be then 
he was very fond of them 
this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham’l being among them 
as records then directed their attention to one of miss mercy drawn when she was only eight years old 
2 and it miss day said mr gardener 
oh 
yes 
the handsomest young lady that ever was seen 
and so accomplished l 
she plays and songs all day long 
in the next room is a new instrument just come own for her 
a present from my master 
she comes hen to-morrow with him 
pride and prejudice 
as handsome as her brother 2 i in ruins mot prejudice 
3 mr gardener whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicative by his questions and remarks mrs records either from pride and-attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister 
2 is your master much at duberley in the course of the year i 
not so much as i could wish sir 
but i dare say he may spend turf his time here 
and miss mercy is always down for the summer months 
except thought elizabeth whom she goes to ksmsgnte.” 1 if your master would marry you might see more of him 
yes sir 
but i do not know when all will be 
i do not know who is good enough for him 
mr and mrs gardener smiled 
elizabeth could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that our should think so a say no more than the truth and what every will say that knows him replied the other 
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far 
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added 
i have never had a cross word from him in my life apply have known him ever since he was four years of 
a this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas 
that he was not a good-tempered man had been her rest opinion 
her keenest attention was awakened 3 she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying 
a there are very few plea of whom so much can be said 
you are lucky in having such a master 
a yes sir i know i am 
if were to go through the world i could not meet with a better 
but i have always observed that they who are good-natured 6 mum and prejudice 
when children are good-natured when they grow up 
and he was always the sweet-tempered most generoushurted boy in the world a elizabeth almost stared at her 
can this be mr dare i thought she 
2 is father was an excellent man said mrs gardener 
yes mamma that he was indeed 
and his son will be just like him 
just as affable to the poor 
elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more 
mrs records could interest her on no other point 
she related the subjects of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain 
mr gardener highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject 
and she dwelt with energy on his many merits no they proceeded together up the great staircase 
a he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived 
not like the wild young men now-a-days who think of nothing but themselves 
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name 
some people call him proud 
but i am sure i never saw anything of it 
to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men 
a in what an amiable light does this place him be thou hat elizabeth 
a his one account of him whispered her aunt as they walked 2 is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend 
a perhaps we might be received that is not very likely 
our authority was too good 
on reaching the spacious lobby above they were now and prejudice 
of shown into a very pretty sitting-room lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below 
and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss mercy who had taken a liking to the room when last at duberley 
he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards 5 one of the windows 
mrs records anticipated miss careys delight when she should enter the room 
2 and this is always the way with him a she added 
whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment 
there is nothing he would not do for her 
the picture-gallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms were all that remained to be shown 
in the former were many good painting 
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss mercy s in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible 
in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to ix the attention of a stranger 
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her 
at last it affected her 
and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr day with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her 
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery 
mrs records informed them that it had been taken in his father's lifting 
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle sentiment towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance

been insufficient to assure the other two that they now now mr fancy the garden pride and prejudice 
by reason of surprize on beholding his master must immediately have told it 
they stood a little floor while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family 
amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment 
and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life 
nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness 
and he ate his inquiries us to the time of her having leftﬁngboum and of her stay in devonshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the direction of his thoughts 
at length every idea seemed to fail him 
and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave 
the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure 
but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence 
she was overpowered by shame and vexation 
her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill-judged thing in the world 
how strange must it appear to him 
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man 
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again the 
why did the come 
or why did he thus come a day before he was expected 
had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination 
for it was plain that he was that moment arrived 
that moment alice hated from his horse or his carriage 
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the 6 pride and prejudice 
meeting 
and his behaviour so strikingly altered 
what could it mean 
that he should even speak to her was amazing l 
but to speak with such civility to inquire after her fall never in her life had she seen his manners so lit a dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting 
what a contrast did it over to his last address in rousing park when he at his letter into her hand 
she knew not what to think or how to account for it 
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a noble all of ground or a line reach of the woods to which they were approaching 
but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it 
and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeared of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they mounted out she distinguished no part of the scene 
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of duberley house whichever it might be where mr dairy then was 
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind 
in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everything she was still dear to him 
perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease 
yet there had been but in his voice which was not like ease 
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure 
at length however the remarks of her corn sins on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself 
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds 
whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of pride and prejudice 
by woods overspreading many and occasional part of the stream 
mr gardener expressed a wish a going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk 
with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round 
it settled the matter 
and they pursued the accustomed circuit 
which brought them in after some time in a descent among hanging w to the edge of the water in one of its narrow parts 
they crossed it b a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene 
it was s t less adorned than any they had yet visited 
and t a valley here contracted into a gun allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it 
elizabeth longed to explore its windings 
but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs gardeners who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought one of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible 
or niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction 
but their progress was slow for mr gardener though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of thing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trust in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little 
while wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprized and elizabeth astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr dairy approaching them and at no great distance 
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met 
elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them 
for a few moments indeed she felt that he would prove pride and pitejumcis‘ 
half strike into some other path 
the idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view 
the turn past he was immediately before them 
with a g once she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility 
and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place 
but she had not got beyond the we s delay dutiful and caring a when some unlucky recollection obtrude and she fancied that praise of duberley from her might be mischievous constructed 
her colour changed and she said no more 
mrs gardens was standing at little behind 
and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends 
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared 
and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his a ear to herself 
what will be his surprize a thought she a when he knows who they are 
he takes them now for plea of fashion 
1 he introduction however was immediately made 
and as a named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decaying as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions 
that he was mrs-2:1 
by the connexion was evident 
he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr gardener 
elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph 
it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush 
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners 
pride and prejudice 
7th the conversation soon turned upon dashing 
and she heard mr dairy invite him with the greatest civility to she there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with wishing ankle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport 
mrs gardeners who was walking arm-in-arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder 
elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly 
the compliment must be all for herself 
her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating 1 why is he so altered 
from what can it proceed 
it can not be for rule 
it can not be for my sake that his manners are thus softened 
my he roofs at rumford could not work such a change as this 
it is impossible that he should still love me after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their elms after descending to the drink of the river for the letter inspection of some curious water-plant there chanced to be a little alteration 
it originated in mrs gardeners who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husband s 
mr dairy took her place by her niece and they walked on together 
after a short silence the lady 1st spoke 
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected 
— a for your housekeeper a she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow 
and indeed before we left farewell we understood that on were not immediately expected in the country 
he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he 12 pride and prejudice

she immediately felt that whatever desire mill fancy might have of being acquainted with her mum he the work of her brother and without looking further it will uni-factory 
it was gratifying to know that till sentiment hole not made him think really ill of her 
they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought 
iilimhcth was not comfortable 
that was iquoiiilxlei lit the was uttered and pleased 
hit walls of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind 
they noon outstripped the other and when they hand reached the carriage mr and mrs garden were half quarter of a mile behind 
he then called her to wall into the house 
but the decline herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn 
at inch 2 time much might have been said and silence was very awkward 
she wanted to talk but there wearied an embargo on every subject 
at last the recollect that she had been travelling and they talked of mntloclt and doleful with great perseverpride and prejudice 
7th once 
yet time and her aunt moved slowly 
and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the lite-54m was over 
on mr and mrs gardener s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment 
but this was declined and they made on each side with the utmost politeness 
mr arch handed the ladies into the carriage 
and when it drove of elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house 
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began 
and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to an thing they had expected 
he is perfect 
well behaved polite and assuming a said her uncle s 
there it something a little merely in him to be sure a replied her aunt 
a but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming 
i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing often i was never more surprized than by his behaviour to us 
it was more than civil 
it was really attentive 
and there was no necessity for such attention 
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very triﬂing.” to be sure lay a said her aunt he is not so handsome as twickenham 
or rather he has not wickham’s countenance for his features are perfectly good 
but how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable 
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kept than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning 
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities 1 replied her uncle 
you great men often are 
and therefore i shall not take him at his word about sing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds 
4 pride and prejudice 
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing 
a from what we have seen of him a continued my partner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wick 
he has not an ill-natured look 
on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks 
and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an an admirable idea of his heart 
but to be sure the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most gaming character 
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes 
but he is a liberal master i suppose 
and lie 
in the eye of servant comprehend every virtue 
elizabeth here felt herself called on to my something in vindication of his behaviour to wicked 
and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kept his actions were capable of a very different construction 
and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham’s so amiable as they had been considered in herefordshire 
in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on 
mrs gardens was surprized and concerned 
but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection 
and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else 
fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they had no sooner dined than she set all again in quest of her former a distance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years continuance 
while and szjuoicn 
7th the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for an of these new friends 
and she could do nothing but t sink and think with wonder of mr dairy s civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister 
chapter £1,317 
elizabeth had settled it that mr dairy could bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching duberley 
and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning 
but her conclusion was false 
for on the very morning after their own arrival at ambition these visitors came 
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage he drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street 
elizabeth immediately recognized the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprize to her relations by a painting them with the honour which she expected 
her uncle and aunt were all amazement 
and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business 
nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece 
while these newly-born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeth feelings was every moment increasing 
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure

he inquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked an spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever done 
to mr and mrs gardener he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself 
they had long wished to see him 
the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention 
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr dairy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquire 
and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love 
of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt 
but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough 
elizabeth on her side had much to do 
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors 
she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all 
and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour 
mingled was ready georgiana was eager and dry determined to be pleased 
in seeing singly her thoughts naturally new to her sister 
and oh 
how prudently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner 
sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance 
but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss mercy who had been set up as a rival to jane 
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard 
nothing occurred 1785 pride and prejudice 
seen them that could justify the hope his sister 
on this point the was soon satisfied 
and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted in recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared 
he observed to her at it moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing hen and before she could reply he added 
it ll have eight months 
we have not me 
since the 14th of november when we were all dancing together at netherﬁeld 
elizabeth was pleased to and his memory so exact 
and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longtown 
there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark 
but there was a look and it manner which gave them meaning 
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr dairy himself 
but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaining and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day 
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace 
when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and collected their last lively scene in uniform parsonage 
the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she pride and prejudice 
7th could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible 
never even in the company of his dear friends at netherﬁeld or his dignity relations at prosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self-consequence or bending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherﬁeld and rousing 
their visitors stayed with them above half-hour 
and when they arose to depart mr dairy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardeners and miss bonnet to dinner at duberley before they left the country 
miss dearly though with a residence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed 
mrs garden looked at her niece desirous of knowing how 16 whom the invitation most concerned felt die as to its acceptance hurt elizabeth had turned away her head 
presuming however that this studied avoidance he rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on 
mingled expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many inquiries to make after all their herefordshire friends 
elizabeth constrain all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased 
and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little 
eager to be alone and fearful of inquiries box pride am prejudice 
or hints from her uncle and aunt she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bigger and then hurried away to dress 
but the had no reason to fear mr and my gardener curiosity 
it wan not their wish to force her communication 
it wan evident that she wan much better acquainted with mr day than they had before any idea of 
it wan evident that he wan very much in love with her 
they saw much to interest but nothing to justify inquiries 
of mr mercy it wan now a matter of next to think well 
and as for at their acquaintance read there was no fault to and 
they could not be touched by his politeness 
and had they drawn hall character from their own feelings and ill 
servants report without any reference to any other account the circle in herefordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for mr dairy 
there wine now an interest however in believing the housekeeper 
and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whole own manner indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected 
neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their ambition friends that could materially lessen its weight 
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride 
pride he richly had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit 
it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the 5 
with respect to william the traveller soon found that he was not held there in much estimation 
for though the chief of his concert with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well-known fact that on his quitting devonshire he had pride and prejudice 31 felt many debts behind him which mr dairy afterwards discharge end 
as for macbeth her thoughts were at duberley this evening more than the last 
and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards an in that mansion 
and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out 
she certainly did not hate him 
no 
hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called 
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to he repugnance to her feelings 
and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendly nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable alight which yesterday had produced 
but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked 
it was gratitude 
— gratitude not merely for having once formed her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and harmony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanied in her rejection 
he who she had been person end would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves on were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister 
such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude 
for to love ardent love it must be attributed 
and as such in impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though could use 5 32 moss and prejudice 
not be exact

she respected the streamed the wan grate us to him she felt a real interest 
in his welfare 
and the only wanted to know how far the wishes that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that the should employ the water which her fancy told her the mill of bringing on the renewal of hit nddreuel 
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility 3 
in dance in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at duberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to he omitted though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their title 
and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at duberley the following morning 
they were therefore to go elizabeth war pleaded 
though when the allied herself the reason the had very little to say in reply 
mr gardener left them soon after brcnkfnat 
the thing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at duberley by noon 
chapter 17 
convinced as elizabeth now was that nice bingley’e dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at duberley must be to her and wan curious to know with how much civility on that lady ride the acquaintance would now be renewed 
on reaching the house they were shown through the hall into the saloon whose further aspect rendered it delighted for summer 
its window

31 ground admitted a most refreshing view of the hill he wood hills behind the house and of the beautiful ma s and punish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn 
in this room they were received by main day who was sitting there with mrs burst and miss bigger and the lady with whom she lived in london 
georgiana’s reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved mrs gardeners and her niece however did her rustic and pitied her 
by mrs burst and miss singly they were noticed only by a courtesy 
and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pause must always be succeeded for a few moments 
it was first stroke b mrs ancestry a genteel agreeable-looking woman w use endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others 
and between her and mrs garden with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on 
miss mercy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it 
and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard 
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bigger and that she could not speak a word especially to miss dry without calling her attention 
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance 
but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much 
her own thoughts were em losing her 
he ox acted every moment that some of the gentlemen would d enter the room 
she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them 
and whether she wished 34 pride and hemmed 
or feared it most she could scarcely determine 
met sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss dingley'l voice elizabeth was round b rev 
giving from her a cold inquiry after the health other family 
she answered with equal indifference and gravity and the other said no more 
the next variation which their visits afforded was prmlucerl by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the fact fruits in season 
but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annexed to mist dairy had been given to remind her of her post 
there was now employment for the whole party 
for though they could not a i talk they could all eat 
and the beautiful braids of green doctrines and preaches soon collected them round the table 
while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether the most fenced or wished for the appearance of mr dry by the feelings which prevail on till entering the room 
and then though but a moment before ll had believed her wishes to predominated she began to regret that he came 
he led been some time with mr gardeners who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning 
no sooner did he appear than elizabeth writer resolved to be perfectly easy and embarrassed 
— or resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicion 
of the whole party were awakened against them and that their was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room 
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked at in miss bingley’a in spite of the smilewhich overspread her face whenever she spoke to one pride and prejudice 
3 of its objects 
for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr dairy were by no means over 
miss mercy on her brothers entrance exerted herself much more to talk 
and elizabeth law that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and fonvnrdcd as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side 
miss singly saw this likewise 
and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of laying with sneering civility 
pray mix eliza are not the shore militia removed from morton 
they must be a great loss to your family 
in days presence she dared not mention william s name 
but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts 
and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment distress 
but exerting herself vigorously to repeat the ill-natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone 
while she spoke an involuntary glance showed her day with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes 
had miss being known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubted would have refrained from the hint 
but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in days opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that no i 
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss arches meditated elopement 
no no creature had it been revealed where secret was possible except to elizabeth 
and from 31 bingley’s connections her brother was particularly 36 pride and prejudice 
anxious to conceal it from that very with which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own 
he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should effect a his endeavour to separate him from miss bent it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend 
elizabeth collected behaviour however soon suited his emotion 
and as miss singly vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wicked georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more 
her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully 
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned 
and while mr dairy was attending them to their carriage miss singly was evening her feelings in criticism on elizabeths person behaviour and dress 
but georgiana would not join her 
her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the war of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable i when fancy returned to the saloon miss singly could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister 
how very ill eliza bonnet looks this morning mr dairy she cried 
i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter 
she is grown so brown and coarse 
louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again 
however little mr fancy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather mum and majumcrt 37 planned 
no ridiculous consequence of travelling in the summer 
a f or my own part 4 the rejoined 1 i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her 
her face is too thin 
her complexion has no brilliancy 
and her features are not at all handsome 
her nose wants character 
there is nothing marked in its lines 
her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way 
and as for her eyes which have sometimes been calm bed so one i never could perceive anything extraordinary in them 
they have a sharp wherewith look which i do not like at all 
and in her air altogether there is s self-sufﬁciency without fashion which is intolerable 1 persuaded as miss singly was that day admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself 
but any people are not always wise 
and in seeing him at last look somewhat settle she had all the success she expected 
he was resolutely silent however 
and from a determination of making him speak the continued 
i remember when we rest met her in herefordshire how many we all were to and that she was a reputed beauty 
and i particularly recollect your say no one night after they had been dining at nethcrﬁyelld 1 s a beauty 
i should as soon call her mother a with but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time a yes 1 replied day who could contain himself no longer about that was only when i trust knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance 
he then went away and miss singly was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself 
my garden and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except 38 nun and summer 
what had particularly interested them both 
the look and behaviour of everybody they had been were damp ensued except of the person who had neatly engaged their attention 
they talked of his 
either hit find his house his fruition everything but himself 
yet elizabeth war longing to know what my garden thou hat of him and a garden would have been high gratified by her nice beginning the chapter 17 
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not lending a letter from lane on their lit arrival at ambition 
and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the morning that had now been spent there 
but on the thing her repeating war over and her sister sustained by the receipt of two letter from her at once on one of which w marked that it had been missed elsewhere 
elizabeth want surprised at it at jane had written the direction remarkably ill 
they had just been up sing to walk an the letter 
came in 
and her uncle an aunt leaving her to enjoy them in view set off by themselves 
the one moment must be at attended to 
it had been written have day ago 
the beginning contained an account of all their little partner and engagements with such new at the country afforded 
but the latter half which was dated 3 day after and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence 
it war to this erect a a since writing the above dearest lay nothing hill occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature 
but am afraid of answering you 
be assured that we are all well 
what i have to lay relates to poor ii pride and prejudice 39 india 
an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forest to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his offers 
to own the truth with wickhaml imagine our surprize 
to little however it does not seem so wholly unexpected 
am v very sorry 
so imprudent a match on both sides 
at i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood 
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart 
his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can ve her nothing 
our poor mother is sadly grieved 
ally father bears it better 
how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him 
we must forget it ourselves 
they were of saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight 
the express was sent of directly 
my dear like they must have passed within ten miles of us 
colonel forswear gives us reason to expect him here soon 
die left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention 
i must conclude for i can not be long from my poor mother 
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first 
by this time my dearest sister you have mind my hurried letter 
i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i can not answer for being covered 
do pride and prejudice dearest likely i hardly know what i would write but i have had new for you and it can not be delayed 
imprudent up a marriage between mr wicket and our poor ladies would be we are now anxious to be altered it am taken place for there ll but too mud reduced to far they are not gone to scotland 
colonel fonder came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hour 
after the pretty 
though lydiu’t than letter to mr f. gave them to understand that they were going to pretend green something was dropped by fanny expressing kill belief that w. never intended to go there or to marry lie at all which we repeated to colonel f. who instantly taking the alarm met off from it intending to trace their route 
lie till trace them civilly to clnphnm but no further 
for on entering that place they removed into a hackneycouch and llitmiuexl the alice that brought them from lip 
all that ll known after thin ll that they were ten to continue the london road 
11 know not what to think 
after making even be in us on that little london colonel f. mill lkhulna idle ordained anxiously renewing them at all the turnpiket and at the inn in flame and held but without any succour 
no such people had been seen to put through 
with the kindest concern he came on to longtown and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner moor creditable to his heart 
i am sincerely grieved for him and my f. but no one can throw any blame on them 
our tliutrcu m dear likely is very great 
my father and mother believe the worst but i can not think no ill of him 
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their lit plan 
and even if l could form we a design again a young woman of lydia’a connection which ll not likely can i supposed her to look to everything 
impossible i grieve to and pride and prejudice 
9 
ever that colonel f. is not disposed to depend upon drury marriage 
he shook his head when i expressed my he s and said he feared w. was not a man to be true m poor mother is really ill and keeps her room 
ca d she exert herself it would be better 
but this is not to be expected 
and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected 
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment 
but as it was a matter of conscience one can not wonder 
i am truly glad dearest likely that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes 
but now as the worst shock is over shall i own that i long for your return 
i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient 
adieu 
i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not 
but circumstances are such that i can not help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible 
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it thou oh i have still something more to ask of the former 
my father is going to london with colonel forswear instantly to try to discover her 
what he means to do i am sure i know not 
but his excessive 
distress will not allow him to music any measure in the best and safest way an colonel forswear is obliged to be at brighton again to-morrow evening 
in such an exigence my uncle advice and assistance would be everything in the world 
he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his g nests 
a oh 
where where is my uncle 
cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious 
but as she reached the door it was opened x a servant and mr dairy appeared 
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start 
2 pride and prejudice 
and before he could recover himself enough to speak she in whose'miud every idea was superseded by ladies situation hastily exclaimed 1 1 your pardon but i must leave you 
i must and 5 garden this moment on business that can not be delayed 
i have not an instant to lose good god i what is the matter 
a cried he with more feeling than politeness 
then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute 
but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardener 
you are not well enough a 
you can not go yourself a elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her after taking to pursue them 
calling back the servant there are she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly 
on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for dared to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration 1 let me call your maid 
is there nothing you could take to give you present relic 
— a glass of wine 
— shall i get you one 
— you are very idle now i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself 
there is nothing the matter with me 
i am quite well 
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longtown 
she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word 
mercy in wretched suspense could only say something distinctly of his concern and observe her in comes 
passionate silence 
at length she spoke again 
i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news 
it can not be concealed from any one 
my pride and prejudice 
3 youngest sister has left all her friends 
has dropped 
— m thrown herself into the power of 
of mr wickhlrn 
they are gone on 
together from brighton 
ton know am too well to doubt the rest 
she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to 
she is lost for every day was fixed in astonishing a when i consider a she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it 
i who knew what he was 
had i but explained some part of it only 
some part of what i learnt to my own family 
had his character been known this could not have happened 
but it is all 
all too late now a i am grieved indeed a cried dairy 
agreed 
choked 
but is it certain 
absolutely certain 
a oh yet 
they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certain not gone to scotland 
2 and what has been one what has been attempted to recover her 
5 1 my father is gone to london 
and jane has written to beg my uncle immediate assistance 
and we shall be off i hope in half-an-honr 
but nothing can be done 
i know very well that nothing can be done 
how is such a man to be worked on 
how are they even to be discovered 
i have not the smaller hope 
it is every way horrible 
fancy shook his head in silent acquiescence 
when my eyes were opened to his real character 
— oh 
had i known what i ought what i dared to do 
but i knew not 
i was afraid of doing too much 
wretched wretched mistake 
a day made no answer 
he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy 
elizabeth soon cheered and instantly understood it 
he 
4 pride and prejudice 
her power was sinking 
everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace 
she could neither wonder not condemn but the belief of his self-conceit brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no imitation of her distress 
it was on the contrary exactly my calculated to make her understand her own wishes 
and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must he vain 
but self though it would intrude could not engross her 
ladies 
the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care 
and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to everything else 
and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i anything to plead in excuse of m stay but real though unavailing concern 
would to even that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress 
— but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely so ask for your thanks 
this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at duberley to-day 
oh yes 
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss mercy 
say that urgent business calls us home immediately 
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible 
i know it can not be long 
he remain assured her of his secrecy 
again expressed 
his sorrow for distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his cow laments for her relations with only one serious parting oak went away 
as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how impropriety sun rnmumcs 
as table it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in devonshire 
and as she threw a retrospection glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have noted in continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination 
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty 
but if otherwise 
if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged 
nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wicket and that its ill success might perhaps authorized her to seek the other less interesting mode attachment 
be that as it may the saw him go with regret 
and in this early exact leg of what ladies infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business 
never since reading jane's second letter had she entertained a hope of wickham’s meaning to marry her 
no one but jane she thought could after herself with such an expectation 
surprize was the least of her feeling s on this ever met 
while the contents of the first letter remain on her mind she was all s rule 
all astonishment that wicked should marry a girl whom it was in table he could marry for money 
and how india could ever have attached him had a pleased incomprehensible 
but now it was all too nature 
for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms 
and though she did not suppose die to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that as pride and prejudice 
neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey 
she had never perceived while the regiment was in herefordshire that indian had any partiality for him 
but she was convinced that l did had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody 
sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite in their attentions raised them in her opinion 
her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object 
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl 
oh 
how acutely did she now feel it 
she was wild to be at home 
to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance 
and though almost 
persuaded that nothing could be done for dim her uncle interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe 
mr and mrs gardener had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly ill 
— 
but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy 
though india had never been a favourite with them mr and mrs gardener could not but be deeply affected 
not die only but all were concerned in it 
and after the first exclamations of surprize and horror mr gardener readily promised every assistance in his power 
elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude 
and all three being actuated by one spirit everything relating to their journey was speedily settled 
they were to be of as soon as possible 
a but what is to be done about pemberlcy 
a cried prudence and some 
go 
mrs gardener 
a john told us mr dairy was here when our sent for us 
— 
was it so -5 
a esq 
and i told him we should not be able to keep our en agreement 
the 
is all settled 
a hat is all settled 
a repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare 
and are they upon such terms as for her to discourse the real truth 
oh that i knew how it was 
a but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour 
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that 
all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself 
but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at ambition with false excuses for their sudden departure 
an hour however saw the whole completed 
and mr gardener meanwhile have settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be one but to go 
and a elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longtown 
chapter 1791 1 have been thinking it over again elizabeth a said her uncle as they drove from the town 
and really a a serious consideration i am much more inclined than was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter 
it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means protected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best 
could he expect ll 
6 8 pride and prejudice 
that her friends would not step forward 
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forswear 
his temptation is not adequate to the risk 
a a do you really think so 
cried elizabeth brightening us for a moment 
a upon my word a said mrs partner i begin to be of your uncle opinion 
it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it 
i can not think so very ill of wick 
on you yourself lay so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it up a a not perhaps of neglecting his own interest 
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable 
if indeed it should be so 
but i dare not hope it 
why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case i 
a in the first place a replied mr garden where is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland oh 
but their removing from the chaise into an hackneyed coach is such a presumption 
and besides no traces of them were to be found on the branch road well then 
supposing them to be in london 
they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exception purpose 
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side 
and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland but why all this secrecy 
why any fear of detection 
they must their marriage be private 
oh no no 
this is not likely 
his most particular friend you see by jane's account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her 
wicked will never marry a price and prejudice 
9 woman without some money 
he can not afford it 
and what claims has india 
what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake force of every chance of bending himself by marrying well up as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the cow might throw on s dishonorable elopement with her am not able to judge 
for 1 know nothing of the effect that such a step might produce 
but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good 
ladies has no brothers to forward 
and he might imagine from my father's be favour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that be would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such 15 matter 
a but can you think that india is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other term than marriage 
it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes 2 that s sisters sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt 
but really i know not what to say 
perhaps i am not doing her justice 
but she is very young 
she has never been taught to think on serious subjects 
and for the last half-year 
nay for a twelvemonth 
she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity 
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way 
since the 
— 
— hire were 1st carteret in morton nothing but love irritation and orders have been in her head 
she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater 
what shall i call it 
susceptibilities to her feelings 
which are naturally lively enough 
and we all know that wicked pride and judge ham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman 1 but you see that jane 1 laid her aunt does not think so ill of richard as to believe him capable of the attempt a of whom does jane ever think ill 
and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against which but jane knows as well up i do what twickenham really is 
we both know that he has been private in every sense of the word 
that he has neither integrity nor honour 
that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating and do you really know all this 
cried mrs gardener whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive 
i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring 
i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr dairy 
and you yourself when last at longtown heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him 
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty 
which it is not worth while to relate 
but his lies about the whole pemherley family are endless 
from what he said of miss fancy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl 
et he knew to the contrary himself 
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her but does ladies know nothing of this 
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand 3 1 oh yes 
that that is the worst of all 
till i was in rent and saw so much both of mr dairy and his relation colonel fitzwilliarn i was ignorant of the truth myself 
and when i returned home the pride and prejudice 
10 
— 
— air was to leave morton in a week or fortnight's time 
as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public 
for of what use could it apparently be to an one that the good a mansion which all the neighbourhood had of him should t en be overthrown 
and even when it was settled that indian should go with mrs faster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me 
that as could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head 
that such a consequence as in should ensue on may easily believe was far enough from my long tale a when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other i a a not the slightest 
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side 
and had anything of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that our in not a family on which it could be thrown away 
when lit he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him 
but so we all were 
every girl in or near morton was out of her senses about him for the first two months 
but he never distinguished river by any particular attention 
and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey 
from elizabeth thoughts it was never absent 
fixed there by the lot pride and bitter 
keenest of all anguish self-reproach she could and no interval of age or forgetfulness 
they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longtown by dinner-time the next day 
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied long ox ton 
the littmardineu attracted by the light of a chaise were standing on the step 
of the house as they entered the pack 
and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprize that lie hunted up their faces and displayed itself over their who s bodies in a variety of capers and risks was the first pleasing meet of their welcome 
elizabeth jumped out 
and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running downstairs from her mother apartment immediately met her 
elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her while tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the negatives 
a a not yet replied jane 
a but now that my dear uncle is come i hope everything will be well 
2 is my father in town up 
yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you wore a and have you heard from him often 
2 we have heard only once 
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do 
he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of import once to mention 
a lamb my mother 
how is she 
how are you all 
a my mother is tolerably well i trust 
though her spirits are greatly shaken 
she is upstairs and will pride and prejudice 
3 have great satisfaction in seeing on all 
she does 
not yet leave her dressing-room 
try and kitty thank heaven are quite well a but you 
how are you i 
cried elizabeth 
a you look pale 
how much you must have gone through 
her sister however natured her of her being perfectly well 
and their conversation which had been no while mr and my garden were engaged win their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party 
jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and danced them both with alternative smile 
and tears 
when were all in the drawing-room the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they noon found that jane had no intelligence to give 
the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not et deserted her 
she still expected that it would all ready well and that every morning would bring some letter either from india or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage 
mrs bonnet to whole apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected 
with tears and lamentations of regret invective against the villains conduct of william and complaints of her own suffering and ill-usage 
blaming everybody but the person to whole ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing 
if i had been able a said the 4 to carry my point in going to brighton with all my family than would not have happened humour dear india had nobody to take care of her 
why did the f omen ever let her go out of their night 
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for the is not the kind of 4 run all advance

oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all but mr gardener though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears 
and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters 
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that on only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject 
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before 
one came from her books and the other from her toilette 
the faces of both however were tolerably calm 
and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty 
as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection won after they were seated at table 
— a this is a most unfortunate admirer and will probably be much talked of 
but we must step the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosom of each other the balm of sisterly consolation of pride and prejudice then

10 1 yes 
but when questioned by birth deny denied knowing anything of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it 
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying 
and from ball i am inclined to hope he i t have been misunderstood before a and till colonel forswear came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married 
a a how was it simple that such an idea should enter our brains i i feel t a little uneasy 
a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right 
my father and mother knew nothing of that 
they only felt how imprudent a match it must be 
kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in ladies last letter she had up red her for such a step 
she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks 
a but not before they went to brighton i 
a no i believe not a and did colonel forswear appear to think ill of wick himself 
does he know his real character i a a i must confess that he did not s as so well of william as he formerly did 
he be loved him to be imprudent and extravagant 
and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left morton greatly in debt 
but i hope this may be false 4 the jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened 
a perhaps it would have been better replied her sister 
a us to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable 
we acted with the best intentions 1 could colonel forswear repeat the particulars of ladies note to his wife 
a he brought it with him for us to see my pride and prejudice 
jane then took it from her pocket 
book and gave it to elizabeth 
there were the contents 
my gun mist 
you will laugh when you know where i an gone and i can not help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning at noon i am minced 
i am going to pretend green and if you can not guest with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he ll an angel 
i should never be happy without him to think it no harm to beef 
you need not send them word at longtown of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign to name a lie wickham.’ what a good joke it will 
i can hardly write for laughing 
pray make my expense to pratt for not keep in my engagement and dancing with him to-night 
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he know all 
and tell him i will dance with him at the next hall we meet with great pleasure 
i shall lend for my clothe 
when i get to longtown 
but i with you would tell sally to mend a great sit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed in 
goodby 
give my love to colonel forswear 
papa you will drink to our good journey 
— your affectionate friend lyme manners a old thoughtless thoughtless l die 
cried elizabeth when ll had finished it 
a hat a letter is thin to be written at such a moment 
but at least it show that s was serious in the object of her journey 
whatever he might afterward persuade her to it was not on her side a bone in infamy 
my poor father 
how he must have felt it 
a i never saw any one so shocked 
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes 
my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole home in such cooliuionl a pride and prejudice 
1800 oh 
jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day 2 1 i do not know 
— hope there wan 
but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult 
my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done 
but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties you advance upon her has been too much for you 
you do not look well 
oh that i had been with you l 
you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them 
kitty is slight and delicate 
and ma studies so much that her hours of repose should more broken in on 
my aunt philip came to longtown on tuesday after my father went away 
and was so good as to stay till thus with me 
she was of great use and comfort to call 
kind lady case has been very kind 
she walked here on wednesday morning to console with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us a she had better have stayed at home a cried edgar both 
a perhaps she mean well but under such a misfortune as this one can not see too little of one neighbours 
assistance is impossible 
condolence insist 
table 
let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied 
she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter 
he meant i believe 1 replied jane to go to no pride and prejudice upon the place where they lay changed borne lee the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them 
his principal object must be to discover the number of the packed coach which took them from claim 
it had come with a fare from london 
and at he thou hat thecircumuaooe of a gentleman and lady removing torn one carriage into another might be remark he mounted mnkcinquiriet at chapman 
if he could anyhow discover at what home the coachman had before not down his fare he determined to make inquiries there and ho it 
might not be impossible to find out the and en number of the coach 
i do not know of any other design that he had formed but he won in such a hurry to be gone and his spirit to gently doom that i had difficulty in sending out even in much l as this 
hum 33 
he whole party were in hope of a letter from mr bonnet the next dooming but the 1800 came in without bringing a single line from him 
his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent 
but at 
such a time they had hoped for exertion 
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to lend 
but even of if they would ha been lad to be certain 
mr gardener had waited only or the letter 
before he met on 
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr bonnet to return to longtown up soon as he could to the great consolation of his linen who considered it an pride and prejudice 
i the only security for her husband not being killed in a dull 
mrs gardeners and the children were to remain in herefordshire a few days longer as the former thou hit her presence might be serviceable to her nieces 
he shared in their attendance on mrs bonnet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom 
heir other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and threatening them tap 
though as she never came without resorting some fresh instance of wickham’s extravagance or irregularly she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them 
all morton seemed striving to back the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light 
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigue all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesman family 
everybody declared that he was the wickedness young man in the world 
and everybody began to and out that they had always distrusted the a panic of his goodness 
elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin still more certain 
and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them 
mr gardener left longtown on sunday 
on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street 
that mr bonnet had been to upon and a pride and prejudice 
claim before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information 
and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal heels in town as mr bonnet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings 
mr gardener himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it 
he added that mr bonnet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon 
there was also a postscript to this effect 
a i have written to colonel forest to desire him to and out if possible from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment whether wicked has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself 
if there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential confuse hence 
at present we have nothing to guide us 
cow angel forswear will i dare say 
do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head 
but on second thoughts perhaps lazy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other son elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded 
but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved 
she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years 
it was possible however that some of his companions in the 
— hire might be able to give more information 
and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something 
a look forward to 
pride and prendiceii3 every day at longtown was now a day of anxiety 
but the most anxious part of each was when the east was ox acted 
the arrival of letters was the rest and a jest of every moment i impatience 
through he enters whatever of good or d was to be told you d be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance 
but before they heard again from mr gained a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr cotillions 
which as jane had received directions to a m all that came for him in his absence she according ye read 
and elizabeth who knew what curiosity his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise 
it was as follows 
a mr day 
sin 
i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to console with you on the grievous affliction you are now muttering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from herefordshire 
be assured my dear sir that mrs cousins and myself sincerely sympathize with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove 
no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviation so severe a misfortune 
or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most admitting to a parent mind 
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comes vision of this 
and it is the more to be lamented use there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence 
thou he at the same time for the consolation of yourself an mrs bonnet i am inclined to think that her own disposition 1 
he 1814 pride and prejvdicemust be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early on age 
however that may be you are grievances to be tied 
in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs ellis but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair 
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others 
for who as lady catherine herself condescending says will connect themselves with such a family 
and this consideration leads me moreover to he cut with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november 
for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace 
let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw of 
your unworthy child from your infection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own desirous offence 
i am dear sir c. etc. mr gardener did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forswear 
and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send 
it was not known that william had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living 
his former acquaintance had been numerous 
but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them 
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him 
and in the wretched state of his own branches there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by india s relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount 
colonel forswear believed that more than a thousand arm and prejudice 
i is undawwldheneoe-irytoclearhiaexpemat brighton 
he owed a deal in the town but his debt of honoorwere more formidable 
mr gardener did not attempt to conceal the particularly from the longtown amply 
jane heard them with horror 
a a tear a die cried 
then in wholly unexpected 
i not an idea of it a mr gardener added in his letter that they might expect to lee their father at home on the following day which was saturday 
rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavour he had yielded to his brother-in-law entirely that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit 
when mrs bonnet was told of thin she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before 
what in he coming home and without poor india 
a she cried 
a sure he will not leave london before he has found them 
who is to light wicket and make him marry her if he comes away 
a as my garden began to wish to he at home it was resulted that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr bonnet came from it 
the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought in master back to longtown 
my garden went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyahire friend that had attended her from that it of the world 
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece 
and the kind of half-expectation which my garden had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing 
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from duberley 
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any no pride and prejudice 
other excuse for the owner of her spirit unnecessary 
nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that 
though elizabeth who was by thin time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings wan perfect 
aware that had the known nothing of day the on d have borne the dread of lydia’a infamy somewhat better 
it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two 
when mr bonnet arrived he had all the a of hit natural philosophy composure 
he aid at little at he had ever been in the habit of laying 
made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before all daughter had courage to speak of it 
it wan not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject 
and then on her bride expressing her montoni for what he must have endured he replied a say nothing of that 
who should suffer but myself 
it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it 
you must not be too severe upon yourself a replied elizabeth 
a you may well warn me against such an evil 
human nature is no room to fall into it 
no lazy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame 
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression 
it will pass away soon enough a do you supply them to be in london 
a a you 
where else can they be 10 well concealed 
a g a and ladies used to want to go to london 1 added it 
a life is happy then a said her father dryly 
2 and her residence there will probably be of some duration then after a short silence he continued 
a likely i hear you no ill-will for being justified in pride and prejudice 
11 your advice to me last may which considering the event shows some greatness of mind 
they were interrupted by miss bonnet who came to fetch her mother s tea 
this is a parade 1 cried he a which does one good 
it ives such an eye once to misfortune 
another day i will do the same 
will lit in my library in my night and pondering gown and give as much trouble as i can 
— or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away 
a i am not in to run away em a said kitty fretful 
a if should ever go to right i would behave better than lydia.” 1 you go to brighton 
i would not insist on so near it as east burn for fifty pounds 
no witty l have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it 
no face is ever to enter my house again nor even to as through the village 
balls will be absolutely profit tied unless you stand up with one of your sisters 
and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner 
lastly who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry 
well we a said he a do not make yourself ha my 
if you are a good girl for the next ten years i take you to a review at the end of them hum 35 
we days after mr bonnets return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shnrbbcly behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her 
but instead of the expected summons when they i l 3 pride and prejudice 
approached her she said to miss bonnet 1 i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have not some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask what do you mean ill 2 we have heard nothing from town a dear madam 1 cried mrs hill in great astonishment doubt or know there is an express come or master from 5 gardener 
he has been here this half-hour and master has had a letter away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech 
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room 
from thence to the library 
— their father was in neither 
and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said 
a if you are looking for my master ma'am he is walking towards the little copses upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the pack 
jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon fagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out 
— oh papa what news 
what news 
have you heard from my uncle 
a yes i have had a letter from him expressing a well and what news does it bring 
good or bad 
a a what is there of good to be expected i 
said he taking the letter from his pocket 
a but perhaps you would like to read it 
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand 
jane now came up 
pride and prejudice 
1810 1 read it aloud 1 laid their father a for i hardly know myself what it is about a grace-church street monday august 2 
a my tom balm 
at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give on satisfaction 
soon after you left me on saturday 
was fortunate enough to and out in what part of london they were 
the particulars i reserve all we meet it is enough to know they are covered 
i have seen them both a a then it is as i always hoped a cried jane 
a they are married 
a elizabeth read on 
a i have seen both 
they are not married nor can i can and there was any intention of being no 
but if you are willing to perform the engagement which i have ventured to make on your side i ho s it will not be long before they are 
all that is required of you in to assure to your daughter by settlements her equal share of the cave thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister 
and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum 
these are conditions which considering everything i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you 
i shall send thin by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer 
you will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr wickham’s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to he 
the world has been deceived in that respect 
and i am hasp ye to so there will be some little money even when a his d as are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own 12 pride and prejudice 
fortune 
if as i conclude will be the case you send me full were to act in your name throughout the whole of thin business i will immediately give direction to daemon for preparing a proper settlements 
there will not be the smallest occasion for our coming to town again 
therefore stay quietly at inngboum and depend on my diligence and care 
send back your answer as soon as you came and be careful to write exactly 
we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve 
she comes to no to-day 
i shall write again as noon at anything more is determined on 
yours c 
a new 
gunman.” win it possible 
a cried elizabeth when she had finished 
a can it be possible that he will marry her i a a wicked is not so undeserving then as we have thought him a said her sister 
my dear father i congratulate you a and have you answered the letter 
said elizabeth 
a no 
but it must be done soon 
most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote 
a oh 
my dear father a she cried a come back and write immediately 
consider how important every moment is in such a case a let me write for you said jane 1 if you dislike the trouble yourself 
a i dislike it very much a he replied 
a but it must be done and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house 
and may i ask 
a said elizabeth 
but the terms i suppose must be complied with pride and prejudice 
in a complied with 
i am only ashamed of his asking so little 2 and they mum 
marry i yet he is and a man a yes yes they must marry 
there is nothing else to be done 
but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about 
and the other how i am ever to pay him 
money 
my uncle 
a cried jane what do you mean sir par i mean that no man in his senses would marry lying on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and softly after i am gone 
2 that is very true a said elizabeth 
though it had not occurred to me before 
his debts to be discharged and something still to remain 
oh 
it must be my uncle doings 
generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself 
a small sum could not do all this 
a no a said her father 
a wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds 
i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship ten thousand pounds 
heaven forbid 
how is half such a sum to be repaid 9 mr bonnet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house 
their father then went to the library so write and the girls walked into the breakfast-room 
2 and they are really to be married 
cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves 
a how strange this is 
and for robin we are to be thankful 
that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice 
oh india 
a i comfort myself with thinking replied jane in 22 pride and prejudice 
2 that he certain would not marry ladies if he had not a real regard or her 
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i can not believe that ten thousand pounds or anything like it has been advanced 
he has children of his own and may have more 
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds 2 if we were ever able to learn what william's debts have been said elizabeth 
2 and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr garden has done for them because wicked has not expense of his own 
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited 
their taking her home and according her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude can not enough acknowledge 
by this time she is actually with them 
if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy 
what a meeting for her when she burst lies my aunt 
2 we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane 1 i hope and trust they will et be happy 
his consenting to marry her is a proof will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking 
their mutual affection will steady them 
and i better myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten their conduct has been such a replied elizabeth was neither you nor i nor anybody can ever forget 
it is useless to talk of it 
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened 
they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her 
he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied 
mobs and prejudice 
2 just as you please 1 may we take my uncle letter to read to her 
a stake whatever you like and get away elizabeth took the letter from his dining-table and they went upstairs together 
try and kill were both with mrs bonnet one communication could therefore do for all 
after slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud 
mrs bonnet could hardly contain herself 
as soon as jane had read mr gardeners hope of ladies being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance 
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been get from alarm and vexation 
to know that her daughter would be married was enough 
she was disturbed by no far for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct 
a dear dear india 
a she cried 
a this is delight all indeed 
— she will be married 
i shall see her again 
— she will be married at sixteen l 
my good kind brothers i knew how it would be 
— l knew he would manage ever in 
how i long to see her 
and to see dear mickleham too 
but the clothes the wedding clothes 
i will write to my sister gardener about them directly 
lay 
my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her 
stay stay i will go myself 
ring the bell kitty for he l. i will put on my things in a moment 
my dear dear india 
— how merry we shall be together when we meet 
a her eldest daughter endeavour to give some relief to the violence of these transported by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardeners behaviour laid them all under 
for we must attribute this happy conclusion 1 she added in a great measure to his kindness 
we are 24 ran an bench wmlklﬂlpkdgd himselftoa-iimr chat with money well a cried her mother it is all very right 
whodwulddoitbut her an uncle 
he had not had a family of his own i and my children men have had all his money 
you know 
anditisthelirutime we have ever had anything from him except a few preach 
well 
i am to happy 
in a short time i shall have a daughter married 
my wicked l 
how well it sounds 
and the was only sixteen tax june 
— my dear jane i am in such a matter that i am sure i can write 
an i will dictate and you write for me 
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards 
but the things should he ordered immediately she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and america and would shortly hare dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted 
one day delay the observed would be small importance 
and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate a usual 
other scheme 
too came into her had 
31 will go to mary it she a as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philip 
and an i come back i can call on lady lungs and my long 
kitty run down and order the carriage 
an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure 
girls can i do anything for you in very 
oh i here comes hill 
my dear hill have you heard the good news 
miss india is going to be married 
and you shall all have a bow of such to make me at her wedding on him i began instantly to expect her joy 
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then luck of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom pride and prejudice 
2 poor ladies situation must at best be bad enough 
but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful she felt it so 
and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected or her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained 
than 1 
5 bonnet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him 
he now wished it more than ever 
had he done his duty in that respect india need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her 
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great brain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place 
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law and he was determined if possible to and out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could 
when first mr bonnet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless 
for of course they were to have a son 
this son was to join in cutting off the details as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for 
five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come 
and mrs bonnet for many years after ladies birth had been certain that he would 
6 pride and prejudice 
this event had at last been d red of but it was then too late to be saving 
mrs sonnet had no turn for economy and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income 
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bonnet and the children 
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the events 
this was one point with regard to lie at can which was now to he ended and mr bonnet could have no hesitation in according to the proposal before him 
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed melt concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect a relation of all that was done and his will nest to fulfil the engagements that had been made or him 
he had never before supposed that could twickenham be prevailed on to many his daughter it would he done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement 
he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them i for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed together through her mother hands india s expenses had been ve little within that sum 
hat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome s rule 
for his wish at present was to have as little to lie in the business as possible 
when the first transport of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence 
his letter was soon despatched 
for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution 
he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry wild die to send my message to her 
the good news quickly spread through the house my 
sun summon 
he and with m rational speed through the neighbourhood 
it was boi'nepii the latter with decent philosophy 
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss l die bonnet come upon the town 
or as the heap jest relative been secluded from the world in some distant farm-house 
but there was much to be talked of in marrying her 
and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the hateful old ladies in morton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain 
it was a fortnight since mrs bonnet had been downstairs 
but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressive high 
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her true he 
the marriage of a daughter which had been the rest object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials line muslins new carriages and servants 
she was busily snatching through the neighbours for a proper situation for her daughter and without knocking or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance

or the great house at stoke if the drawing-room were larger 
but rushworth is too far of i could not bear to have her ten miles from me 
and as for punish lodge the attic are dreadful her husband allowed her to talk on without interrupt ton while the servants remained 
but when they had withdrawn he said to her a mrs bent before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding

far since her marriage would an early give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who went not immediately on the spot 
she had no far of in spreading farther through his 
mean 
there were few people on whose secret the would have more confidently depended 
but 
at the lame time there was no one whose knowledge of a date 
gravity would have married her an much 
not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a half impassable between them 
had lydia’a marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be up that mr fancy would connect himself with a family ye where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned 
pride and prejudice 
29 from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink 
the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbysbire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow us this 
she was humbled the was grieved

she became jealous of his esteem when the could no longer hope to benumbed by it 
she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence 
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him 
when it was no longer likely they should meet 
what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been g by and gratefully received 
he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex 
but while he was mortal there must be a triumph 
she began now to come defend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her 
his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes 
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her case and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved 
and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance 
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what conjugal felicity really was 
an union of different tendency and including the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family 
how wicked and ladies were to be upon in tolerable independence she could not imagine 
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture

mr gardener soon wrote again to his brother

13 mr bonnet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham’s removal from the

cheshire as clearly as mr gardener could do 
but mrs bonnet was not so well pleased with it 
ladies being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her come my for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in herefordshire was a severe discontent 
and besides it was such a pity that indian should be taken from a red invent where she was acquainted with everybody and has 
so many favourites 
a she is so fond of mrs forever a said she a it will be quite shocking to send her away 
and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much 
the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment 
his daughters rev nest for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative 
but lane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longtown as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished 
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to show her married daughter in the new hbourhood before she was banished to the north 
hen mr bonnet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come 
and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longtown 
elizabeth was surprized however that wicked should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes

heir sister's wedding-day arrived 
and jane and elizabeth felt for her 
probably more than she felt for herself 
the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinner-time 
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bonnets and jane more especially who gave india the feelings which would have attended herself had s been the pulpit and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure 
they came 
the family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive them 
smiles locked the face of mrs bonnet as the carriage drove up to the door 
her husband looked impenetrable grave 
her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy 
ladies voice was heard in the vestibule 
the door was thrown open and she ran into the room 
her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture 
gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wicked who followed his lady and wished discern both joy with an alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness 
their reception from mr bonnet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial 
his countenance rather aimed in austerity and he scarcely opened his lip s. light easy assurance of the young couple 
and was enough to provoke him 
elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bonnet was shocked 
die was lie still 
unformed abashed wild noisy and fearless 
she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations 
and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there 
pride and prejudice 
31 william was not at all more distressed than herself 3 but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all 
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance 
but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man 
she blushed and jane blushed 
but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion offered no variation of colour 
there was no want of discourse 
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough 
and twickenham who happened to sit near elizabeth began inquiring after his acquaintance that neighbourhood with a good-humoured easeswhich she felt very unable to equal in her replies 
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world 
nothing of the past was recollected with gain 
and ladies led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world 
only think of its being three months 1 she cried a since i went away 
it seems but a fortnight i declare 
and yet there have been things enough happened in the time 
good gracious 
when i went away i am sure 1 had no more idea of being married till i came back again 
though i thought it would be ve good fun fit was 
her father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth looked expressively at india 
but she who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued 
oh 
mamma do the people hereabouts know i am married to-day 
i was afraid they might not 
and we overtook william holding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next 34 pride and prejudice to him and took toil my gloves and let my hand just rest upon the window-tax so that he might 
see the rain 
and then i bowed and smiled like anything 
elizabeth could hear it no longer 
she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them paling through the hall to the dining-parlour 
she then joined them soon enough to see die with anxious parade walk up to her mother's right hand and hear her my to her eldest sister ah jane i take your place now and you men go lower because i am a maid woman 
it was not to be sun on that time would give lying that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first 
her ease and good spirits increased 
she longed to sue mrs helps the leaves and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs wickham” by each of them 
and in the meantime 
she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to mrs hill and the two housemaids 
well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast-room 2 and what do you think of my husband 
is not he a cunning man 
i am sure my sisters must all envy me 
i only ho they may have half my good luck they must all go to brighton 
that is the place to get husbands 
what a pity 
is mamma we did not all go 
a very true 
and if i had my will we should 
but my dear l die i doubt at all like your going such a way all 
out it be so 2 oh lord 
yes 
there is nothing in that 
i shall like it of all things 
you and papa and my sisters must come love and see us 
we shall be it castle all the winter and i dare say there am ll be some yellow and i will take care to get good partners for them all pride and prejudice 
3 i should like it beyond anything 
said her mother 
2 and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you 
and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over i thank on for my share of the favour a said elizabeth 
but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands 
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them 
mr william had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight 
no one but mrs bonnet regretted that their stay would be so short 
and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent ties at home 
these parties were acceptable to 
l to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not 
wickham’s affection for die was just what elizabeth had expected to and it 
not equal to india s for him 
she had scarcely needed her resent observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his 
and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to cope with her at all had she not felt certain that his light was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances 
and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion 
die was exceedingly fond of him 
he was her dear william on every occasion 
no one was to be put in competition with him 
he did cvcrytlring best in the world 
and she was sure he would kill more birds on the rest of september than anybody else in the country

and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away a if the was reading a sermon 
however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickhzrn 
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat

i thought it would never be over 
for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid nun can all the time i was with them 
if you believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight

repeated elizabeth in utter amazement 
a oh yes l 
he was to come there with william you know 
but gracious me 
i quite forgot 
i ought not to have said a word about it 
i promised them so faithfully 
what will twickenham say 
it was to be such a secret 
a 
if it was to be a secret a said jane say not another word on the subject 
you may depend upon my seeking no further 1 oh

2 we will ask you no questions 
a thank you a said l die 
a for if our did i should certainly tell you all and then william would be so angry on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to mr it out of her power by running away 
out to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible 
or at least it was impossible not to try for information 
mr dairy had been at her sisters wedding 
it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least term action to go 
conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain 
but she was satisfied with none 
those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable 
she could not hear such suspense 
and hastily seizing sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what india had drop if it were compatible with the secrecy which had it intended

and then must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance 
a not that i boil though a she added to herself and she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and string to and it out jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what india had let fall elizabeth was glad of it 
— till it a pleased whether her inquiries would receive any satin action the had rather be without a confidant 
chapter 13 
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she sensibly could 
she was no sooner in possession of it than he rings into the little close where she was least likely to interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy 
for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial 
a gmccchnrch street sept 6 
my mail nine 
i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee test a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you 
i must confess myself surprised by your applicapride and prejudice 
if tom 
i did not expect it from you 
don't think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined touch inquiries be necessary on your aid 
if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impatience 
your uncle ll as much surprised at i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he hat done 
but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit 1 on the ve day of my coming home from longtown your one he had a most unexpected visitor 
mr dairy called and was shut up with him several hours 
it wan all over before i arrived 
so my curiosity was not so dreadfully locked your seems to have been 
he came to tell 5 partner that he had found out where your sister and mr twickenham were 
and that he had seen and talked with them both 
wicked repeatedly india once 
from what i can collect he left devonshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them 
the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him 
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world 
his character was to speak for itself 
he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself 
if he bad number motive i am sure it would never disgrace him 
he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them 
but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had 
and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow ill 
its pride and prejudice 
a there is a lady it seems a mrs younger who was some time ago governess to miss mercy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what 
she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings 
this my younger 
was he knew intimately acquainted with william 
and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town 
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted 
she would not betray her trust i so prose without liberty and corrupting for she really did now where her friend was to be found 
wicked indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her 
at length however our kind friend procured the wished-for direction 
they were in street 
he saw william and afterwards insisted on seeing india 
his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go 
but he found lying absolutely resolved on remaining where she was 
she cared for none of her friends 
she wanted no help of his 
she would not bar of leaving twickenham 
she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when 
since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expensive a marriage which in his very first conversation with william he easily aunt had never been lit design 
he confessed himself f obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of ladies right on her own folly alone 
he meant to resign his commission immediately 
and as to his nature situation he could pride and prejudice 
4 conjecture very little about it 
he must go together but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on 
mr drury asked him why he had not married your enter it once though mr bonnet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benumbed by marriage 
but he found in reply to this question that wicked still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country 
under such circumstances however he was not likely to he proof against the temptation of immediate relief 
they met several times for there was much to be discussed 
wicked of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable 
a everything being settled between him mr careys next st was to make our uncle acquainted with it and he st called in church street the evening before i came home 
but mr gardener could not be seen and mr dairy found on further inquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning 
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postpone seeing him till after the departure of the former 
he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business 
a on saturday he came again 
your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together 
they met again on sunday and then i saw him too 
it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longtown 
but our visitor was ve obstinate 
i fancy likely that obstinacy is the m defect of his character after all 
14 pride and prejudice 
he has been accused of many faults at different times but plan is the me one 
nothing was to be done that that he did not do himself 
though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole 
a they settled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved 
but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the rain 
and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due 
but lazy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at 
most 
you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people 
his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased 
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above 
it was owing to him to his reserve and want 
of proper consideration that wickham’s character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was 
perhaps there was some truth in mr though i doubt whether bit reserve or anybody reserve can be answerable for the event but in spite of all this one talking my dear lazy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for months inure in the affair 
a when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at duberley 
but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when pride and prejudice 
if the wedding took lace and all money matters were then to receive the as banish 
a i believe i have now told you everything 
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprize 
i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure 
ladies came to us 
and william had constant admission to the house 
1 was exactly what he had been when i knew him in herefordshire 
but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with bar behaviour while she stayed with us if i had not received by jane's letter last wednesday that her condition on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain 
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family 
if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen 
i was sometimes quite provoked but then i collected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her 
mr dairy was punctual in his return and was lying informed you attended the wedding 
he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again in 
wednesday or thursday 
will you be very angry with me my dear lay if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never hold enough to say before how much like him 
his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in devonshire 
his understanding and opinions all please me 
he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and die if he marry prudently his wife may teach him 
i thought him very sly 
— he hardly ever mentioned your name 
but slyness seems the fashion 
a pray forgive me if i have been very presuming 
or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from par i shall never be quite happy till i have been all in p11113181 rum mnddiepu-t. ahvphgm'idnniaelitﬂgpir ofponhvunldbedxevuything

it wan reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong 
he had liberality and he had the mean of exercising it 
and though she would not place here are his principal inducement the could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned

but the was proud of him 
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself 
she read over her aunt commendation of him again and again 
it was hardly enough 
but it pleased her 
she wan even sensible of some plan though mixed with regret on finding how steadfast both the and her uncle had been persuaded that a tone and conscience submitted between mr dairy and herself 
she was roused from her seat and her selection by come once approach 
and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wicked 
i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister 
a mind he as he joined her 
a you certainly do a she replied with a smile 
but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome i should be sorry indeed if it were 
we were always a good friends 
and now we are better 1 me 
are the other coming out i a a i do not know 
my bonnet and ladies are going in the carriage to mention 
and so my dear sister i ii

and from our uncle and aunt that you have actuallyeeen pembcrley.” she replied in the affirmative 
a i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would he too much for me or else i could take it in my way to neatly 
and you law the old housekeeper i suppose 
poor records 
the was always very fond of me 
but of course the did not mention my name to you a yes the did a and what did she say 
2 that you were gone into the army and the was afraid had 
not turned out well 
at such a distance as that you know thing are manager mimpreaented.” 
certainly a he replied lifting his lips 
elizabeth hoped the had silenced him 
but he noon afterwards mild 
a i was surprised to alice dairy in town but month 
we passed each other several times 
i wonder what he can be doing there 2 a a perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bought a said elizabeth 
a it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year a a undoubtedly 
did you see him while you were at ambition -5 i thought i undertake from the gardener that on hard a et 
he introduced us to his sister 
and do you like her 
a a very much a i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within thin year or two 
when i last saw her the w not very promising 
i am very glad you liked her 
i hope she will turn out well i dare lay she will 
the has got over the most quiz e. 
you go by the village of hymen par i do not reckon lest that we did pride and predict 
4 i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had 
a most delightful place excellent parsonage house i it would have suited me in every ere the 
how should you have liked making sermons a a exceedingly well 
i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing 
one ought not to me in 
but to be sure it would have been such a thing or me i the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of he illness 
but it was not to be 
did you ever hear arch mention the circumstance when you were in kept 2 a a i have heard from authority which i thought a good that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present strong 
you have l as there was something in 14 
i told us so from the rest you may remember ran a 1 
hear too that there was a time when semanmaking was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present 
that you actually declared our resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromise accordingly a you did l 
and it was not wholly without foundation 
you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it the were now almost at the door of the house for she ha walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters cake to provoke him she only said in reply with a good-humoured smile 
a come mr twickenham we are brother and sister you know 
do not let us quarrel about the past 
in future i hope we shall be always of one mind 
she held out her hand 
he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house 
48 ham and prejudice chapter 33 
5 william was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it 
and she was pleased to and that she had said enough to keep him quiet 
the do of his and lydia’l departure soon came and mrs bonnet was forced submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to castle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth 
a oh 
my dear lying a she cried a when shall we meet again 
oh lord 
i don't know 
not these two or three cares perhaps a rise to me very often my dear 
a as often as i can 
but you know married women have never much time for writing 
my sisters may write to my 
they will have nothing else to do 
mr wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife 
he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things 
he is as one a fellow a said mr bonnet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw 
he simpler and marks and makes love to us all 
i am prodigiously proud of him 
i defy even sir william cast himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law the loss of her daughter made mrs bonnet very dull for several day i 
a i often think a said she 2 that there is nothing so bad as parting with one s friends 
one seems so forlorn without them a this is the consequence you see made of marrying a daughter said elizabeth 
a it must pride and prejudice 
its make you better satisfied that your other four are single it is no such thing 
l dies does not leave me because she is married 
but on my because her husband's regiment happens to be so far or 
if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon 
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulating 
the housekeeper at netherﬁeld had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks 
mrs bonnet was quite in the edge 
she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns 
well well and so mr singly is coming down sisters for mrs lips first brought her the news 
a well so much the better 
not that i care about it though 
he is nothing to us you know and 1 am sure i never want to see him again 
but however he is very welcome to come to netherﬁeld if he likes it 
and who knows what may happen 
but that is nothing to us 
you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it 
and so is it quite certain he is coming 2 1 you may depend on it replied the other for mrs nights was in morton last night 
i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it 
and she told me that it was certainly true 
he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday 
she was going to the butcher's she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just at to be killed miss bonnet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour 
it was many months since 50 pride and prejudice 
she had mentioned his name to elizabeth 
but now ii soon as they were alone together she said 
— i saw you look at me to-day in when m aunt told us of the present report 
an i know i or are distressed 
but don't imagine it was from any up my candle 
i was only confused for the moment because felt that i should be looked at 
i do assure you that the news does not expect me either with pleasure or pain 
i am glad of one thing 
that he comes alone 
because we shall see the less of him 
not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other pen legs remarks elizabeth did not know what to make of it 
had she not seen him in devonshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged 
but she still thought him partial to june and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friends permission or being bold enough to come without it 
yet it it hard a she sometimes thought that this poor man can not come to a house which he has lee fly hired without raising all this speculation 
i said save him to himself in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it 
they were more disturbed more on walk than she had often seen them 
he subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again 
a as soon as ever mr singly comes my dear a said mrs bonnet 1 you will wait on him of course 
no no 
you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should pride and prejudices 
marry one of my daughters 
but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a foolish errand against his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherﬁeld 
is an etiquette i despise a said he 
a if he wants our society let him seek it 
he knows where we live 
i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him 
but however that shut prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined 
we must have mrs long and the moulding soon 
that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him consoled by this resolution she was the better able to hear her husband's incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr mingle in con fence of it before me did 
as the day of his arrival drew near a i begin to be sorry that he comes at all a said jane to her sister 
it would be nothing 
i could see him with perfect indifference 
but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of 
my mother means well 
but she does not know 
no one can know 
how much i suffer from what she says 
happy shall i be when his stay at netherﬁeld is over 
a a i wish i could say anything to comfort you a replied elizabeth 
but it is wholly out of my power 
you must feel it 
and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much 
mr singly arrived 
mrs bonnet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could 
she counted 15 pride and prejudice 
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent 
hopeless of seeing him before 
but on the third morning after his arrival in herefordshire she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the pack and ride towards the house 
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy 
jane resolutely kept her place at the table 
but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the window 
she looked 
she saw mr day with him and sat down again by her sister 
there is a gentleman with him mamma a said kitty 
who can it be 2 a a some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose 
i am sure i do not know 
a la 
a replied kitty 
it looks just like that man that used to he with him before 
— mr what his name 
— that tall proud man a good gracious 
mr dairy 
— my so it does i vow 
well any friend of mr bingley’s will always be welcome here to be sure 
but else i must say that 
i hate the very sight of him jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern 
she knew but little of their meeting in devonshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter 
both sisters were uncomfortable enough 
each felt for the other and of course for themselves 
and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr dairy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr single s friend without being heard by either them 
lit elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to show mrs gardeners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him 
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused pride and prejudice 
3 and whose merit she had undervalued 
but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the rest of beasts and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what are felt for singly 
her astonishment at his coming 
at his coming to netherﬁeld to longtown and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in devonshire 
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional low and a smile of delight added pasture to her he s as s a thought for that space of time that his actions and wishes must still be unshaken 
but she would not be secure 
a let me first see how he behaved said she 
a it will then be early enough for expectation 
she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door 
jane looked a little pale than usual but more adapted than elizabeth had expected 
on the gentleman's appearing her colour increased 
yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance 
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command 
she had ventured only one glance at dairy 
he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in herefordshire than as she had seen him at duberley 
but perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt 
it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture 
mingled she had likewise seen for an instant and in 5 4 runs arm price 
thatahortperiod uwlﬁmlmkinghoth ahead exhausted 
hewureceivedbymn with a degree of civility which made her two daughter 
amazed especially when contrasted with the cold and ammonium politeness of her clumsy and address of his en 
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the reservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so all lived 
parry after inquiring of her how mr and my garden did 
a question which she could not answer without confusion 
said scarcely anything 
he was not seated by her 
perhaps that was the reason of his silence 
but 
it had not been so in devonshire 
there he had talked to her friends 
when he could not so herself 
but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice 
and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and fro silently on no object but the ground 
more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed 
she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so 
could i expect it to be otherwise 
a said the 
a yet why did he come 2 
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself 
and to him she had hardly courage to s t 
peace inquired after his sister but could do no more 
it is a long time mr singly since you went away said mrs bonnet 
lie readily agreed to it 
i began to be afraid you would never come back again 
pen lee aid say a meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas 
great pride and prejudice 
l however i ho it is not true 
a great many changes have ha pencil the neighbourhood since you went away 
is case is married and settled 
and one of my own daughters 
i suppose you have heard of it 
indeed you must have seen it in the papers 
it was in the times and the course i know 
though it was not put in as it ought to be 
it was only said a lately george william s 
to miss india bonnet 1 without there being a syllable em said of her father or the place where she lived or anything 
it was my brother gardeners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it 
did you see it -5 a single replied that he did and made his congratulations 
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes 
how mr dairy looked therefore she could not tell 
a it is a delightful thing so be sure to have a daughter well married 
continued her mother 
but at the same time mr singly it is very hard to have her taken away from me 
they are gone down to castle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long 
his regiment is there 
for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shore and of his being gone into the regular 
thank heaven 
he has ran friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves 
elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr dairy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat 
it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before 
and she asked singly whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present 
a few weeks he believed 
a when you have killed all your own birds mr singly said her mother a i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr bonnets manor

a when you went to town lastwinter you promised to take a family dinner with us an noon at you returned 
i have not forgot you see 
and i alarm you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement 
pride and prejudice 
x singly looked a little silly at this reception and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business 
ah then went away 
mrs bonnet ha been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day 
but though she always kept a very good table she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year 
chance 39 
s soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirit 
or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must eaten them more 
mr careys behaviour astonished and vexed her 
why if he came only to be silent grave and indiscreet a said she a did he come at all i she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure 
he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town 
and why not to me 
if he fears me why come hither 
i he no longer cares for me 
why silent 
teazing teazing man 
i will think no more about him 
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the alps reach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful oak which showed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth 
now a said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy 
i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming 
i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly 18 pride and prejudice seen that on both sides we met only as common and indifferent acquaintance 
a yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly 
2 the jane 
take cared a my dear lazy you can not think me so weak as to be in danger now a i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as over the did not see the gentlemen again till today 
and as bent in the meanwhile was giving way to all the heap my cheeks which the good humour and common politeness of mingled in half-hour s visit had revived 
on tuesday there was a large party useable at longtown 
and the two who were most anxious expected to the credit of their punctuality an apt 
men were in very good time 
hen they 5 ‘iil’t‘d to the dining-room elizabeth eagerly watch to see whether singly would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister 
her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself 
on entering the room he seemed to hesitate 
but jane happened to look round and happened to smile 
it am decided 
he placed himself by her 
elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked to word his friend 
he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that single had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eye likewise turned towards ii 
day with an expression of half-laughing alarm 
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner-time as showed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane 5 happiness and his own pride and prejudice 
19 would be speedily secured 
though the dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour 
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could bout 5 for she was in no cheerful humour 
mr dairy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them 
he was on one side of her mother 
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage 
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse 
but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did 
her mother ungraciouaneu made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth mind 
and she would at times have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family 
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together 
that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of invention than the mere ceremonious sea station attending his entrance 
anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that made her almost uncivil 
she looked forward to their entrance as the point on llehriechdall her chance of pleasure for the evening must a 
a if he does not come to me 15 a said she a i shall give him up for ever 
the gentlemen came 
and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes 
but alas 
the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bonnet was taking tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair 
and 16 name no rewards 
on the gentleman's approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper 
2 the men shoot come and part us i am determined 
we want none of them 
do we 2 
dare had walked away to another part of the room 
she for owed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to wife and then was enraged against herself f for being so silly 
a a man who has once been refused 
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love 
in there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the time woman 
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings 
a she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee-cup himself 
and she seized the opportunity of saying 2 is your master at pemberlcy still i a a as she will remain there till christmas 
2 and quite alone 
have all her friends left her 3 
a mrs annual is with her 
the others have been gone on to marlborough these three weeks she could think of nothing more to say 
but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success 
he stood by her however for some minutes in silence 
and at last on the young ladies whispering to elizabeth again he walked away 
when the tea-things were removed and the charitable placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victims to her mother pity or whist-players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party 
she now lost every 
expectation of pleasure 
they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had pride and prejudice 
if nothing to hunger but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself 
mrs bonnet had designed to keep the two netheriield gentlemen to supper 
but their carriage was unlucky ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them 
well girls a said she as soon as they were left to themselves that say you to the day 
i think everything has passed all uncommonly well i assure you 
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw 
the venison was roasted to a turn 
and everybody said they never saw so fat at haunch 
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the cases last week 
and even mr dairy acknowledged that the parties were remarkable well done 
and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least 
and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty 
mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not 
and what do you think she said besides 
ah 
mrs bonnet we shall have her it netherﬁeld at last she did indeed 
i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived 
and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously mrs bent in sun was in very great spirits 
she had seen enough of being less behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last 
and her expressions of advantage to her family when in 3 ha humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappoint at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals 
a it has been a very agreeable day said miss bonnet to elizabeth 
the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other 
i hope we may often meet again n. l 16 pride and prejudice 
elizabeth smiled 
a lazy you must not do so 
you must not suspect me 
it worries me 
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it 
i am perfectly raised from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affect ton 
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleading than any other man 
you are very come said her sister 
you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment a how hard it is in some cases to he believed 
-5 2 and how impossible in others 
a a but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge 
a v that is s question which i hardly know how to answer 
we all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing 
f forgive me 
and if you persist in indifference do not make me your conﬁdante.” tbspttr 17 
few days after this visit mr singly called again and alone 
his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time 
he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits 
mrs bonnet 1 this sentence us here separate from the next in accordant with a reference in 1 letter of miss attends to the pages of the first edition on which itnccun

no v 3 where two sentences are made into one

pride and prejudice 
3 invited him to dine with them 
but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere 
next time you call a said she i hope we shall he more lucky 1 he should be particularly ha play at any time c. c. and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them 
a can you come to-morrow 
a yes he had no engagement at all for to-morrow 
and her invitation was accepted with alacrity 
he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed 
in ran mrs bonnet to her daughters room in her dressing gown and with her hair half banished crying out a my dear jane make haste and hurry down 
he is come 
mr blind is come 
he is indeed 
make haste make haste 
ere sarah come to miss bonnet this moment and help her on with her gown 
never mind miss quizzes hair we will be down as soon as we can a said jane 
a but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went upstairs half an hour ago for 
hang little what has she to do with it 
come be quick be quick where is your sash my dear 
a but when her mother was gone jane would not he prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters 
the use anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening 
a tear tea mr bonnet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went upstairs to her instrument 
two obstacles of the cave being thus removed mrs bonnet sat looking and drinking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them 
elizabeth would not observe her 
and when at last kitty 16 pride and prejudice 
did she ve innocently said what is the matter mamma at do you keep working at me for 
what am i to do 
a a nothing child nothing 
i did not wink at you 
she then sat still live minutes longer 
but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to lift a come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room 
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth 
which spoke her distress at such meditation and her entreaty that s would not give in to it 
in a few minutes mrs bonnet half opened the door and called out a lazy my dear i want to speak with you elizabeth was forced to go 
2 we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall 
a kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawing-room 
mrs bonnet schemes for this day were ineffectual 
mingled was everything that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter 
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party 
and he bore with the ill-judged consciousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter 
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper 
and before he went away an engagement vows armed chiefly through his own and mrs bonnets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband 
after this day jane said no more of her indifference 
not a word passed between the sisters concerning pride and prejudice 
16 bring 
but elizabeth went to bed in the he pays belief that all must speedily be concluded unless 5 dairy returned within the stated time 
seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence 
being was punctual to his appointment 
and he and mr bonnet spent the morning together as had been agreed on 
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected 
there was nothing of presumption or folly in kindly that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence 
and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him 
display of course returned with him to dinner 
and in the evening mrs bonnets invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and her daughter 
elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after ten 
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mother schemes 
but on returning to the drawing-room when her letter was finished she saw to her innate surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her 
on opening the door she perceived her sister and kindly standing together over the earth as if engaged in earnest conversation 
and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all 
time situation was awkward ennui he 
but bank she thought was still worse 
not a sly able was uttered by either 
and elizabeth was on the point of going away again w a single who as well as the other had sat down sudden rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room 
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure 
and instantly embrace of guns all 
nmuurcs 
in her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world 
this too much she added 
a by far too much 
i do not deserve it 
oh 
why is not everybody as hasp ye i a large elizabeths congratulations were given with sincere a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express 
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane 
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present 
i must go instantly to my mother she cried 
a i would not on any account tried with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself 
he is gone to my father already 
oh 
likely to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family 
how shall i hear so much happiness 
a she then hastened away to her mother 
who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting upstairs with kitty 
elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation 
2 and this said she 2 is the end of all his friends anxious circumspection l of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest and most reasonable end 
in a few minutes she was joined by singly whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose 
a where is your sister 3 a said he hastily as he opened the door 
a with my mother upstairs 
she will be down in a moment i dare say mobs and summon 
16 he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister 
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship 
they shook hands with great cordiality 
and then 1 her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own ha dimness and jane's perfections 
and in spite of his in a lover elizabeth recall believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent his tone of jane and a general similarity of feeling an taste between her and himself 
it was an evening of no common delight to them all 
the satisfaction of miss bonnets mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever 
kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon 
mrs bonnet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to single of nothing else for half an hour 
and when mr bonnet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was 
not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his love for the night 
but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said 
a jane 1 congratulate you 
you will be a very happy woman jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness 
a you are a good girl 1 he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking on will be so happily settled 
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together 
your tempers are by no means unlike 
you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on 
so easy that every servant will cheat you 
and so generous that you will always exceed your income 16 pride and prejudice 
a i hope not so 
imprudence or thoughtlessness in many matters would be unpardonable in at 
a speed their income 
my dear mr bonnet cried his wife a what are you talking of 1 why he has four or have thousand a-year and very likely more 
then addressing her daughter oh 
my dear dear jane i am so his ye i am sure i shan't get a wink of sleep all night 
i knew how it would be 
i always said it must be so at last 
i was sure on could not be so beautiful for nothing 
dream 5 as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into herefordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together 
oh l he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen i a wicked india were all forgotten 
jane was beyond competition her favourite child 
at that moment she cared for no other 
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for object of happiness which she might in future be able to spend 
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherﬁeld 
and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter 
mingled from this time was of course a daily visitor atzlongboum 
coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper 
unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough dawned had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept 
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister 
for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else 
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur 
in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her 
and when being was gone and constantly sought the same means of me if 
pride and rnzyumcu 
16 he has made me so happy said she one evening 1 by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town just spring i had not believed it possible i suspected as much a replied elizabeth 
but how did he account for it 2 
a it must have been his sister doing 
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i can not wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects 
but when they see as i trusted will that theirbrotherisha win me they will learn to be contented and we she be on good terms again 
though we can never what we once were to each other that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter 
good girl 
it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingley’s pretended regard 
a a would or believe it like that when he went to town last over he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again 
a a he made a little mistake to be sure 
but it is to the credit of his modest this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane an his silence and the little value he put on his own good qualities 
elizabeth was pleased to and that he had not betrayed the inner fence of his friends 
for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him 
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed 
a cried jane 
oh 
size why am i thus single from my family and blessed above them all 
if i could but see you as happy 
if there were but such another man for you 
its pride and prejudice 
a if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you 
till i have your disposition your goodness 1 never can have your ha illness 
no no let me shift for myself 5 and perhaps i have very good luck i may meet with another mr confining time 
the situation of affairs in the longtown family could not be long a secret 
mrs bonnet was privilege to whisper it to mrs pills and lit ventured without 
w permission to do the same by all her neighbours in em a 
he bonnet were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when did had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune 
charm 17 
one morning about a week after bingley’s engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room their attention wan suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage 
and they perceived a chaise-and-four driving up the lawn 
it was too early in the morning for balmy and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours 
the horses were post 
and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them 
as it was certain however that somebody was coming singly instantly prevailed on miss bonnet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery 
they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though pride and prejudice ill with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered 
it was lady catherine de bough 
they were of course all intending to be surprised 
but their astonishment was beyond their ox station 
me on the rest of mrs bonnet and kitty ought she was perfect unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth feel t 
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeth salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying i word 
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship entrance though no request of introduction had been made 
mrs bent all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost listener 
after sitting for a moment in silence she said very silly to elizabeth 
— 
1 hope you are well miss bonnet 
that lady i ill she is your mother 
a elizabeth replied very concisely that she was 
2 and all i suppose it one of your sisters 
a a yes madam a said mrs bonnet delighted to speak to a lady catherine 
she is my youngest girl but one my youngest of all is lately married 
and my eldest is somewhere about the round walking with a young man who i believe wig soon become a part of the family 
you have a very small park here a returned lady catherine after a short silence 
a it is nothing in comparison of rousing my lady i dare say 
but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas’s.” this must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in summer the windows are full west 
i 7 i pride an d prejudice 
more bent assured her that they never let there after dinner and then added 
— nay i take the liberty of asking our ladyship whether you left mr and my calling we pay a yes very well 
i saw them the night before last 
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte on it were the cold probable motive for her calling 
but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled 
more bent with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment 
but lad catherine very resolutely and not very politely deep lined eating anything 
and then rising up aid to elizabeth 
mine bonnet there seemed to be a pratyi-h kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn 
i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company 1 go my dear 1 cried her mother a and show her ladyship about the different walks 
i think she will be pleased with the bermuda 
elizabeth obeyed an running into her own room for her parent attended her noble guest downswinas they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the door 
into the dining-parlour and drawing 
room and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent-looking rooms walked on 
her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it 
they proceeded in silence hung the gravel-walk that led to the couple 
elizabeth was determined to make no efforts for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable 
how could i ever think her like her nephew 
a said the an she looked in her face 
as won an they entered the copses lady catherine began in the following manner pride and prejudice 
i 7 1 you can be at no loss in bonnet to understand the reason of my journey hither 
your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come 
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment 
indeed you are mistaken madam 
i have not tears all able to account for the honour of seeing you ere 
miss bonnet 1 replied her ladyship in an angry tone 1 our ought to know that i am not to be trifled with 
out however insincere you may choose to be you shall not lend me so 
m character has ever been celebrated for in sincerity in frankness and in a chance of such moment as thus i shall certainly not depart from it 
a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago 
i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bonnet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew 
my own nephew 
mr dairy 
though i time it man be a scandalous falsehood 
though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this pace that i might make my sentiments known to you if you believed it impossible to be true a said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain 1 i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far 
what could your ladyship propose by it i 
a at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted your coming to longtown to see me and my family a said elizabeth coolly a will be rather a confirmation of it 
if indeed such a report is in existence of 
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it 
has it not been industrious circulate by yourselves 
4 pride and prejudice 
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad 2 a a i never heard that it was and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it i a i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship 
you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer a this is not to be borne 
miss bonnet i insist on being satisfied 
has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage 
a a your ladyship has declared it to be impossible it ought to be so 
it must be so while he retained theme of his reason 
but your arts and slluremenu may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family 
you may have drawn him in a if i have i shall be the last person to confess it 
a miss bonnet do you know who i am 
i have not been accustomed to such language as this 
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerning a but you are not entitled to know mix 
nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit let me be rightly understood 
this match to which you have the pressure ton to inspire can never take place 
no never 
mr mercy is engaged to m daughter 
now what have you to say i 
a only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me 
lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied 
the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind 
from their infancy they have been intended for each other 
it was the favourite wish of life mother as well as of hers 
while in their candles we pride and prejudice 
if planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the word and wholly allied to the family 
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends 
to his tacit engagement with miss c bough 
are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy 
have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin 
a 
yes and i had heard it before 
but what is that to me i if there is no other objection to m marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept me it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to mar miss de bough 
you both did as much as you cool in planning the marriage 
its completion depended on others 
if mr mercy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice 
and if i am that choice why may i not accept him 
a a because honour decorum prudence 
ma interest forbid it yes miss bonnet interest 
for c not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all 
you will be censured alighted and despised by every one connected with him 
your alliance will be a disgrace 
your name will never even be mentioned by any of us there are heavy misfortunes 1 replied elizabeth 
a but the wife of mr day must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her adoration that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine 1 obstinate headstrong girl 
i am ashamed of soul is this your gratitude for my attentions to you t spring 
is nothing due to me on that score 
a let us sit down 
you are to understand miss 1760 pride and prejudice 
bonnet that i came here with the determined definition of carrying my purpose 
nor will i be divided from it 
i have not been used to submit to any son s him 
i have not been in the habit of brow in deep mmem.” a meal will make your ladyship agitation at present more pitiable 
but it will have no effect on rude if will not be interrupted 
hear me in silence 
my daughter and my me how are formed for each other 
they are dearer ends on the maternal side from the lame noble line 
and on the farther from table honourable and ancient though entitled familiar 
their fortune on both side in splendid 
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective bounded 
and what in to divide them 
the part prevention of a young woman without family connections or fortune 
in a this to be endured 
but it must not shall not be 
if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up a in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself an quitting that there 
he in a gentleman 
i am a gentleman daughter to far we are equally a rule 
you are gentleman's daughter 
but who was your mother 
who are your uncle 
and aunt do not imagine me ignorant of their condition 1 whatever my connection may be said elizabeth a if your nephew does not object to them they can be anything to you a tell me once for all are you engaged to him i though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moment deliberation 1 i am not lady catherine seemed pleased 
pride and prejudice 
red 2 and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement i a a i will make no promise of the kind a miss bonnet i am shocked and astonished 
i expected to and a more reasonable sung women 
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever reach 
i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require 
and i certainly never shall give it 
i am not to be intimidate into anything so wholly unreasonable 
your ladyship wants mr dared to marry your daughter 
but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable 
supposing him to be attached to me would in refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin 
allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which ye have supported this extraordinary application have no as frivolous as the application was ill-judged 
you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasion as these 
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in by affairs i can not tell 
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine 
i must be 
therefore to be importune no farther on the subject not so hasty if you lease 
have by no means done 
to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add 
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous also meant 
i know it all 
that the young man's marrying her was a patched-on business at the expense of your father and uncle 
and is met a girl to be my nephew s sister 
is her husband who is the son of his late father's steward to be his brother 
heaven and earth 
of what are you drinking i are the shades of duberley to be thus collected 
i you can now have nothing farther to say a she ii 
m l 7 8 pride and prejudice 
resentfully answered 
a you have insulted me in every possible method 
i must beg to return to the home and she rose as she spoke 
lady catherine rote also and they turned back 
her ladyship was highly increased 
a you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew 
unfeeling jellies girl 
do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody 
lady catherine i have nothing farther to say 
you know my sentiments 1 you are then resolved to have him 
a i have said no such thing 
i am only resolved on act in that manner which will in my own opinion continue my heap infer without reference to you or to any person so who lay unconnected with me a it in well 
you refuse then to oblige me 
you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude 
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world neither duty nor honour nor gratitude 1 replied elizabeth a has any possible claim on me in the present instance 
no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr dairy 
and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment concern 
and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the corner a and this in your arm opinion 
this is your real resolve 
very well 
i than 
now know how to act 
do not imagine miss bonnet that your ambition will ever be gained 
i came to try you 
i m m 
to and you reasonable 
but depend upon it i will carry my point pride and prejudice 1791 in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were it the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added 
a a i take no leave of you miss bonnet 
i tend no compliment to your mother 
you deserve no such attention 
i am most seriously displace 
elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to made her ladyship to return into the house was led quietly into it herself 
she heard the carriage drive away a he proceeded upstairs 
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the drawing-room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself 
a she did not choose it said her daughter 
a she would go a a she is a very fine-looking woman 
and her calling here was prodigiously civil 
for the only came i suppose to to us the rolling were well 
she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through morton thought she might as well call on you 
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lay 
elizabeth wan forced to give in m a little falsehood here 
for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible 
thank 1791 
he discomposure of a fruits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be crying overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly 
lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from roaring for the sole purpose of 18 pride and moral breaking off her supposed engagement with mr dairy 
it was a rational scheme to be sure 
but from what the report of their engagement could originated elizabeth was at a loss to imagine 
till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bigger and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to supply the idea 
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together 
and her neighbours at lucy lodge therefore for through their communication with the confines the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set him 
down as almost certain and immediate which a had looked forward to as possible at some future time 
in revolving lady catherine's expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the stable consequence of her persisting in this interference 
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application of her nephew 
and how i might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce 
she knew not the exact degree of his agitation for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than be could do 
and it was certain that in enumeration the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakness side 
with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning 
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and pride and prejudice 
31 entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him 
in that clue he would return no more 
lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to single of coming again to netherlield must give way 
a if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days a she added 
i shall know how to demand it 
shall then give over every expectation 
every wish of his constancy 
if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at ill 
the surprize of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great 
but they obligingly stirred it with the me kind of supposition which 1 appeased mrs bonnets curiosity 
and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject 
the next morning as she was going downstairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand 
a lazy said he i was going to look for you 
come into my room she followed him thither 
and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held 
it suddenly mock her that it might be from lady catherine 
and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent ox plantations 
she followed her father to the place and they both sat down 
he then said 
a i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly 
as it principally concerns yourself on ought to know its contents 
i did not know he or that i had we daughters on the drink of 18 pride and prejudice 
matrimony 
let me congratulate you on a very important conquest the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt 
and she was determined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or ended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself 
when her father continued 
a a you look conscious 
young ladies have great alteration in such matters as these 
but i think may defy even our sagacity to discover the name of your admirer 
his letter is from mr collins.” 1 from mr cotillions 
and what can be have to say 
a something very much to the purpose of course 
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good-natured gossip cases 
i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point 
what relates to yourself is as follows having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs cousins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject another 
of which we have been advertised by the same authority 
your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bonnet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most industrious personage in this land a can you possibly guess lazy who is meant by this 
— a this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with everything the heart of mortal can most desire 
splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage 
yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may inch by a precipitate close with this gentleman's proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of pride and prejudice 
31 1 have you any idea lazy who this gentleman is 
but now it comes out 
a a my motive for caution you is as follows we have reason to imagine that viscount lady catherine de bough does not look on the match with a friendly 45 1 mr dare you see is the man now lay i think i been surprised you 
could he or the cases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectual to what they related 
mr day who never looks at any woman but to see a cherish and who probably never looked at you in his life 
it is admiral et 
elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry but could only ones one most reluctant smile 
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her 
a are you not diverted 
oh 
yes 
pray read on 
a a after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion 
when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match 
i thought it my duty to give the species intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer ma be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned 
mr cotillions moreover add a i am truly rejoiced that my cousin india s sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known 
i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into 1814 pride and prejudice 
your house as soon us they were married 
it was an encouragement of vice 
and had i been the rector of longtown i should very strenuous have opposed it 
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing 
— tale is his notion of christian forgiveness 
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte's situation and his expectation of s young olive-branch 
but lazy you look as if you did not enjoy it 
you are not going to be new i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report 
for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn 
a a oh l 1 cried elizabeth a i am excessively diverted 
but it is so strange 
a yes 
4 
is what makes it amusing 
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing 
but by perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd 
much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr confines correspondence for any consideration 
nay when i read letter of his i can not help giving him the preference even over twickenham much as i value the impudence and he cries of my cousin 
law 
and pray lazy what said lady catherine about this report 
did she call to refuse her consent 2 1 to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh 
and as it had been asked without the least position she was not distressed by his repeating it 
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not 
it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried 
her father had most cruelly married her by what he said of mr careys indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too pink she might have fancied too rub 
pride and prejudice 
18 than 1803 
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr angles to do he was able to bring day with him to lnngbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's visit 
the gentlemen arrived early 
and before mrs bonnet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter satin momentary dread beings who wanted to be alone with jane rested their walking out 
it was agreed to 
a glance war not in the habit of walking 
mary could never spare time but the remaining live set off together 
kindly and jane however soon allowed the others to outstripped them 
they dragged behind while elizabeth kitty and dairy were to entertain each other 
very little was said b either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk 
a elizabeth wan secretly forming desperate resolution 
and perhaps he might be doing the same 
they walked towards the cases became kitty wished to call up a maria 
and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone 
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed 
and while her courage was high she immediately said 
— a mr fancy i am a very selfish creature 
and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may he wounding yours 
i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kin to my poor sister 
ever since i have known it i have been most anxious acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it 
were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to vex run 
i am sorry exceedingly sorry a deep red dairy in 1806 pride and prejudice 
a tone of surprise and emotion 2 that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken lie t have given you uneasiness 
i did not 
think mrs order was so little to be trust a you must not blame my aunt 
ladies thoughtlessness 1st betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter 
and of course i could not rest till knew the particulars 
let me thank you again and again in the name of ill my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of his 
covering them if you will thank me a he replied a let it be for yourself alone 
that the wish of giving happiness to on might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny 
but your must owe me nothing 
much as i respect them i believe i thought only of your elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word 
after a short pause her companion added a you are too generous to tried with me 
if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once 
low affections and wishes are unchanged 
but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak 
and immediately though not very gently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances 
the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do 
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eyes she might have seen how well the 1 ii 
m 
pride arm prejudice 
37 expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him 5 but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection even moment more valuable 
hey walked on without knowing in what direction 
there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects 
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present of understanding to the efforts of his aunt who died on him in her return through london and there relate her purely to longtown its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth 
dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyship apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which is 
had refused to give 
but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrarywrse 
it taught me to ho a mind he was i had scarcely ever allowed myself to open before 
i knew enough of our disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frank and of -5 elizabeth coloured and in bed as she replied 
yes you know enough of my hair to believe me capable of that 
after abusing on so abominably to your face i could have no scruples in abusing you to all your relations 
what did you say of me that i did not deserve 
for though your accusations were ill-founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof 
it was unpardonable 
i can not think of it without abhorrence 
2 we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame 1803 mum and prejudice 
annexed to that evening a said elizabeth 
the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable 
but since then we have both i hope improved in civility i can not be so easily reconciled to myself 
the recollection of what i then said 
of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it 
is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me 
your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner those were your words 
you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me g 
though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression 
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way i can easily believe it 
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure on did 
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in anyupoasible way that would induce you to accept me 
oh 
do not repeat what i then said 
these recollections will not do at all 
i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of its dry mentioned his letter 
a did it a said he a did it man make you think better of me 
did you on reading it give any credit to its contents 
she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed 
a i knew a said he 2 that what i wrote must give you pain 
but it was necessary 
i hope you have destroyed the letter 
there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread you having the farm and rnmumcc 39 power of reading again 
i can remember some express 
stone which might justify make you hate me 
2 the letter sha l certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the reservation of my regard but 
thou oh we have both reason to think my of iron not entire ye unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies a when i wrote that letter a replied fancy a i believed myself perfectly calm and cool 3 but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit 
the letter perhaps began in bitterest 
but it did not end so 
the adieu is charity itself 
but think no more of the letter 
the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten 
you must learn some of my philosophy 
— think only of the past as its remembrance gives you leisure 1 i can not give you credit for any his can by of the kind 
tour retrospections must be so totally void of me reproach that the contentment arising from them is not philosophy but what is much better of ignorance 
but with me it in not so 
painful recollections will inside which can not which ought not to be repeated 
i have been a search being all my life in practice though not in principle 
as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper 
i wan given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit 
unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoiled by my parents who though themselves in father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing 
to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rent of the world to wm at least to 1800 pride and prejudice 
think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own 
such i was from eight to eight-and-twenty 
and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth 1 what do i not owe you 
you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous 
by you i was properly humbled 
i came to you without a double my reception 
you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased 1 
had you then persuaded yourself that i should i 
a indeed i had 
what will you think of my vanity 
i believed you to he wishing expecting my addresses 1 my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you 
i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong 
how you must have hated me after that evening i a a hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction 
i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at duberley 
you blamed me for coming 
a a no indeed i felt nothing but surprize 
your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you 
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due 
a my object might a replied dairy was to show you by every civility in my power that was not no mean as to resent the past 
and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill-opinion by letting our see that your reproofs had been attended to 
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half hour after i had seen you he then told her of georgim’s delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden pride and prejudice

interruption 
which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon left that his resolution of following her from her share in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend 
she expressed her gratitude again 
but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther 
after waking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know anything about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home 
what could become of mr bigger and jane 
2 was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs 
fancy was delighted with their engagement 
his friend had given him the earliest information of it 
i must ask whether you were surprised 
a mind elizabeth 
a not at all 
when i went away i felt that it would soon happen 2 that is to say you had given your permission 
i guessed as much and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case 
a on the evening before my going to london a said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago 
told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent 
his surprize was great 
he had never had the slightest suspicion 
i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him 
and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together 19 ema-drew wwuﬁﬁxﬂmm areas-gum “dhfpkﬁnywmdnv-iq”dl z “vhayumﬂhdn-yilnludli-.¢ mdyﬁu-yhilnhhﬁ

a my dear lazy where can you have been walking to 
2 was a question which elizabeth received from jane is soon at she entered the room and from all the others when they us down to table 
she had only to lay in reply that had wandered about till he was beyond her own knowledge 
she coloured a she spoke 
but neither that nor anything else awakened a suspicion of the truth 
the evening w quietly unmarked by anything extraordinary 
he know edged lovers talked and laughed 
the unacknowledged were silent 
day was not of a did tom in which ha press overcome in mirth 
and again agitated and consented rather new that shewn ha my than it herself to be no 
for beside the in late embarrassment there were other evil before her 
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known 
the win aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the other it was a rule which not all his fortune and consequence might do away 
at night she opened her heart to jane 
oh corn was very far from miss bonnets general habits she was absolutely incredulously here 
a you are joking lazy 
this can not be 
— engaged to mr l l 
no no you shall not deceive me 
i know it to impossible this is a wretched beginning indeed my robe d defence was on you 
and i am sure nobody else win i believe me if you do not 
yet indeed i am in earnest 
i speak nothing but the truth 
he still loves me and we are engaged 
a jane looked at her doubtingly 
oh lazy 
it can not be 
i know how much you dislike him ii 
no 9 pride and prejudice 1 you know nothing of the matter 
am ll all to be forgot 
perhaps i did not alwaylove him to well at i do now 
out in such can at these 1 good memory is unpardonable 
this it the la time i shall ever remember it myself in bonnet still looked all amazement 
elizabeth again and more curiously ensured her of in truth 
good heaven 
can it be really to 
yet now i must believe you cried jane 
a my dear dear likely i would 
i do congratulate you 
but are you certain 
forgive the question 
ire you quite certain that you can be in play with him 
both can be no doubt of that 
it in nestled between us already that we are to be the ha plied couple in the world 
but are you placed one shall on like to have such a brother 
a a cry very much 
nothing could give either singly or myself more delight 
but we considered it we talked of it at impossible 
and do you really love him quite well enough 
on lazy 
do anything rather than marry without infection 
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do 
a 
oh yet 
you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all 
what do you mean 
a way i must coat that i love him better than i do singly 
i am afraid you will be angry 
a my dearest sister now be be curious 
i want to talk very seriously 
let me know everything that i am to know without delay 
will you tell me how long you have loved him 
a it has been coming on to gradually that i hardly know when it began 
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful ground at pemberley.” another entreaty that the would be serious however pride and prejudice 
19 produced the desired died and the noon failed jane yes her nobleman maul-mm of attachment 
when connncedhon that article man bent had nothing further to win 
a now i am quite ha x a said the far you will be a b m myself 
always had a value for him 
were it 5 nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him 
but now a bingley’l friend and your husband there can he only dimly and yourself more dear to me 
but lazy you have been very lay very received with me 
how little did you tell me of what placed it duberley and lamhtonl i owe all that i know of it to another not to you 
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy 
she had been unwilling to mention bringing 
and the united m of her own feeling 
had made her rally avoid the name of his friend 
but now the way d no longer conceal from her his share in lydia'l marriage 
all we acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation 
a good gracious 1 cried my bonnet an the stood at a window the next morning of that disagreeable mr dairy in not coming here again with our dear singly what can he mean by being so tiresome ll to be always coming here 
i had no moon but he would go a-shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company 
what shall we do with him 
lay you most walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley’a was -5 elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet we 
really vexed that her mother should be always giving him inch in spite 
as noon at they entered singly looked at her no expressively and shook hand with such warmth at left no doubt of good information 
and he noon after l 6 pride and prejudice 
were laid aloud mr bonnet have you no more lane harbour in which size may lose her way again to-day 
a i advise mr dairy and hazy and kitty 1 laid my bonnet 1 to walk to bahama mount thin morning 
it in a nice long walk and mr dairy hat never seen the view 
a it may do very well for the other 
led mr singly 
a but i am cure it will be too much 5 kitty 
wo n't it kitty 
kitty ownedvthat the had rather my at home 
fancy refuted a rent curiosity to see the view from the aunt and elizabeth silently consented 
all the went upstairs to get ready on bonnet followed her saying a i am quite carry likely that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself 
but i hope you will not mind it it in all for june take you know 
and there in no occasion for talking to him except just now and then 
so do not put yourself to inconvenience during their walk it was resolved that mr bonnets content should be asked in the corner of the evening 
elizabeth reserved to herself the a london for her mother 
she could not determine w her mother would take it 
sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man 
but whether she were violently act gum the match or violently delighted with it 
it wan certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her acute 
and the cold more bear that mr dairy should hear the fire rapture of her joy than the sum vehemence of her diuppmhotion 
in the evening soon after mr bonnet withdrew to the library the saw mr dairy rice also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it wan extreme 
she ranks and prejudice 
19 did not fear her father opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that do his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be telling him with fear regrets in dispose of her was a wretched reflection and she eat in misery till mr drank a red again when looking at him she was a little removed by his mile 
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper a go to your father 
he wants you in the library she was gone directly 
her father wan walking about the room looking grave and anxious 
a lazy a said he a what are you doing 
are you out of your senses to be accepting thin man 
have not you always hated him go how earnestly did the then wish that her former union had been more reasonable her expression more moderate 
it would have spared her from explanations and pmfeseiooo which it was exceedingly awkward to give 
but they were now necessary and he assured him with some conclusion of her arm went to mr dairy 
or in other words you are determined to have him 
he is rich to be sure and you may have more one clothes and one carriage 
than jane 
but will they make on happy 1 find you any other direction a said elizabeth a than your belief of my mind fence 
a one at all 
we all know him to be a proud unpleasant son of man 
but this would be nothing if you really liked him 
a i do i do like him he replied with tears in her 5 
a i love him 
indeed he has no improper pride 
he in perfectly amiable 
you do not know what he really in 
then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such termed a lazy said her father a i have given him my 18 sums and some consent 
he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse anything which he condescend to ask 
i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him 
but let me advise you to think better of it 
i know your disposition lazy 
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband 
unless you looked up to him as a superior 
your lively talents would place out in the greatest danger in an unequal mania e. on could scarcely escape discredit and misery 
my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life 
you know not what you are about 
elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply 
and at length by repeated assurances that mr dairy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him mad undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumeration with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her father s incredulity and reconcile him to the match 
a well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say 
if this be the case he deserves you 
i could not have parted with you my size to any one less worthy 
to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr dairy had voluntarily done for indian 
he heard her with astonishment 
this is an evening of wonders indeed 
and so day did everything 
made up the match gave the money paid the fellow s debts and got him his commission so much the better 
it will save me 3 world of trouble and economy 
had it been your uncle doing i must and would have paid him 
but these violent sung lovers carry everything their own way 
i shall offer to pay him to-morrow he will pride and prejudice 
red not and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading mr collim’l letter 
and after laughing at her sometime allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room 
if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after hulf-an-hour s quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure 
everything was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away 
there was no longer anything material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time 
when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night she followed her and made the important communication 
its effect was most extraordinary 
for on first hearing it mrs bonnet not quite still and unable to utter a syllable 
nor was it under many man minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them 
she began at length to recover to get about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself 
good serious 
lord bless me 
only think 
dear me 
5 dairy 
who would have thought it and is it really true 
oh my sweetest lazy 
how rich and how great you will be 
what prize-money what jewels what carriages you will have 
jones is nothing to it 
nothing at all 
i am so pleased 
so ha pry 
such a charming mania 
so handsome 
so mill 
oh my dear lazy 
pray apologise for any having disliked him so much before 
i hope he will overlook it 
dear dear lazy 
a house in town 
everything that is charming 
three daughters 200 pride and prejudice 
married 
ten than a year 
oh lord 
what will become of me 
i shall go distractedly this was enough to rave that her approbation need not be doubted 
and elizabeth rejoicing that such an illusion was heard only by herself soon went away 
but before the had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her 
my dearest child all cried i can think of nothing else 
ten thousand a year and very likely more 
this as good as a lord 
and a special license 
you must and shall be named by a special license 
but 
my dearest love tell me what dish mr mercy is particularly fond of that i may have it to-morrow this was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be 
and elizabeth found that though in the certain impression of his warmest affection 
and secure of her relations consent they was will something to be wished for 
but the morrow passed of much better than she expected 
for mrs bonnet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion 
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him 
and mr bonnet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem 
i admire all my sons-in-law highly a said he 
“wicitham perhaps is my favourite 
but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane's pride and prejudice 
2 chapter 1 
elizabeth s fruits soon rising to playfulness again she wan mr dared to account for his having ever fallen in love with her 
a how could you begin 
said she 
i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once mule a beginning 
but what could set you of 
in the first place in a i can not ix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation 
it is too in ago 
i was in the middle before i knew that i he on 
my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners 
my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you a than not 
now be sincere 
did you admire me or my impatience 
a for the loveliness of your mind i did 
a you ma as well call it impertinence at once 
it was very light a loss 
the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of delicious attention 
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your a motion alone 
i roused and interested you because was no unlike beam 
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it 
but in s it of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just 
and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you 
there 
i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it 
and really all thin i considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable 
d be sure us know no actual good of me 
but nobody thinks olytba when they fall in love 20 pride and prejudice 
2 was there no good in our affectionate behaviour to jane while the was ill at etherﬁeld 
a dearest jane 
who could have done less for her 
but make a virtue of it by all means 
my good qualities are under your protection and on are to exasperate them as much as possible 
an in return it belongs to me to and occasions for teasing and travelling with you as often as may be 
and shall no directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last 
what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here 
why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me 2 1 because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement 1 but i was embarrassed 
and so was i 
a you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner 
a man who had felt less might 
how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it 
but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself 
i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to india had certainly great effect 
tea meet i am afraid 
for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise 
for i ought not to have mentioned the subject 
this will never done a you need not distress yourself 
the moral will be perfectly fair 
lady catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts 
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude 
i was not in 1 humour to wait for an opening of yours 
my aunt hale and pure advice 
2 intelligence had given me hope and l was determined at once to know everything 
lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her ha pay for she loves to be of use 
but tell me 
what did you come down to netherﬁeld for 
was it merely to ride to longtown and be embarrassed 
or had you intended any more serious confuse uncles 
a real us bestowed on andto'ude if could am ever hope make you have me 
my avowed one or what i avowed to m self was to see whether your sister was still till to angles and if she were so make the con son to him which i have since made 
a shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her up 
a i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth 
but it out t to he done 
and if on will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done direct -5 2 and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the cleverness of your writing as 1 another young lad once did 
but have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr dairy had been overrated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardener long letter but now having box 
to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to and that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows 
— a i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i on hit to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particular 
but to say the truth i was too cross to write 
you supposed more than really existed 
but new suppose as much as you chuse 
give a loose 24 pride and prejudice 
to your fancy indulge our imagination in every single light which the subject will afford and unlgsypo believe me actually married you can not greatly en 
you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last 
i thank on again and again for not going to the lake 
how could i be so silly as to wish it 
your idea of the jones is delightful 
we will go round the park every day 
i am the happiest creature in the world 
perhaps other pen life have said so before but no one with such justice 
am happier even than jane 
she only smiles laugh 
mr dare sends you all the low in the world that can be spared rob me 
you are all to come a duberley at christmas 
yours et 
mr. careys letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr bonnet sent to mr calling in reply to his last 
does six 
31 must trouble you once more for congratulations 
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr dairy 
console lady catherine as well as you can 
but if i were you i would stand by the nephew 
he has more to give 
yours sincerely 
are miss bingley’s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere 
she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard 
jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved 
the joy which miss mercy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brothers in pride and prejudice 
2 tending it 
four rides of paper were inmlﬁcient to contain tell her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister 
before any answer could arrive from mr cotillions or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longtown family heard that the confines were come herself to lucy lodge 
the reason of this sudden remark was soon evident 
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the content of her nephew s letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the much was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over 
at such a moment the arrival of her friend won a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the comic of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr dairy exposed to all the king and obsequious civility of her husband 
he he it however with admirable calmness 
he could even listen to sir william lucy when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest swell of the country and expressed his hopes of their l meeting frequently at st wells with very decent composure 
if he did hung his shoulders at was not till sir william was out of sight 
mrs philip s vulgarity was mother and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance 
and though my home as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley’s good humour encouraged yet whenever she jig speak she must be vulgar 
nor was her t for him though it made her more quiet at all like ye to make her more elegant 
elizabeth did ill she could to shield him from the rent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification 5 and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from ill this took from the moon of courtship much of its pleasure it rob me and nerves 
added to the ho of the future 
and he looked forward with delight t to the time when they should be removed from society no little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at duberley 
calm 1 
apply for all her maternal feeling i was the day 
on which my bonnet not rid of her two moor deserving daughters 
it what delighted pride she oﬂerwardu visited my bigger and talked of my fancy may be guessed 
i with i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earliest desire in the urabliahment of so many of her children produced it ha my an effect ill to make her a sensible amiable well armed woman for the rest of her life 
though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have reminded domestic felicity in so unusually i form that die still was occasionally nervous and invariable will 
for bonnet mind his second daughter exceedingly 
his infection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do 
he delighted in going to duberley especially when he was lent ox mr bigger and one remained at netherﬁeld only a twelvemonth 
so near a vicinity to her mother and morton relation was not desirable even to by my temper or her affectionate heart 
the darling wish of hit sisters woe then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derby-hire 
and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other 
kitty to her very material advantage i at the chief of her time with her two elder sisters 
in society so pride and prejudice 
20 superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great
