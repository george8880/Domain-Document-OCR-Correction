of one who had ever seen catherine morland in her infancy would have opposed her born to he an heroine 
her situation in life the character of her father and mother her own person and disposition were all equally against her 
her father was a clergyman without being neglected or s and a very respectable man though his name wan carts and he had never been handsome 
he had a considerable independence besides two good livings and he was not in the least addicted to suckling s his daughters 
her mother wan a woman of useful pay a sense with a good temper and what is more remarkable with a good constitution 
she had three sons before catherine was born 
and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world as any body might expect she still lived on 
lived to have six children more 
to see them growing up around her and to enjoy excellent health herseff 
a family often children will be always called a fine family where there are heads and arms and enough for the number 
but the morland had iii other right to the word for they were in general very plain and catherine for many years of her life as plain as any 
she had i thin awkward figure i allow skin 2 northanger abbey 
without colour dark lank hair and strong features 
so much for her person and not less unptopitionl for heroism seemed her mind 
she was fond of all a gayest and greatly preferred cricket not merely to do is t to the more heroic enjoyment of infancy nursing a donnouoe feeding a canary-bird or altering a rosehush 
indeed the had no taste for a garden and if she owes at all it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief at least no it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she wan forbidden to make 
such were her propensities 
her were quite as exuaordina 
she never could learn or understand anything before she was taught and sometimes not even then for the was often inattention and occasionally study it 
her mother was three months in teaching her on ay to repeat the 1 beggar'l petition 1 and after all her next sitter sally could say it hem than she did 
not that catherine was always l snipid 
by no means 
she learnt the table of 6 the are and many friends as quickly as my girl in england 
her otherwise her to learn music 
and catherine was sure she should like it for she was very fond of thinking the keys of the old forlorn spinnet so at eight years old she an 
she learnt a year and could not bear it 
and rs morland who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in spite of capacity or dictate allowed her to leave of 
the day which dismissed the musicmaner was one of the of catherine s life 
her taste for drawing war not superior 
though whenever she could obtain the outside a later from brother or sense upon any other odd piece of paper she did what she could in that way by drawing homes and three hens and chicken all very much like one another 
writing and account she was taught by her father 
french by her mother 
her prudence in either was not remarkable and are shield her lawns in both northanger abbey 
3 whenever she could 
what a strange maceountahle character 
for with all these symptoms of pmﬂigacy at ten years old she had neither a bad heart debt a had temper was seldom smbhom scared ever quarreloome and very kind to the little ones with interruptions of tyranny 
she was moreover noisy and wild hated contentment and clearness and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the green slope at the hack of the house 
such was catherine morland at ten 
at ﬁfteen appearancesweremending 
she began to curlherhair and long for balls her complexion improved her unites were softened by plumpness and colour her eyes gained more animation and i her figure more consequence 
her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for only and she grew clean as she grew smart 
she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her usual in governing 
a catherine grows quite a good-looking girl 
she is almost pretty to-day 1 were words which caught her can now and then 
and how welcome were the sounds 
to look alarm p is an acquisition of higher delight to a girl who hat looking plain the first fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her oracle can ever receive 
mrs morland was a very good woman and wished to see her children everything they ought to be but her time was so much occu led in lying-in and teaching the little ones that her e1 her daughters were inevitably left to shift for themselves 
and it was not very wonderful that catherine who had by nature nothing heroic about her should prefer cricket hate ball riding on horas back and running about the county at the age of fourteen to books or at least books information in provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be gained from then provided they were all marys and no 
4 northanger abbey 
reflection she had never any objection to books at all 
but from often to seventeen she was in calling for a heroine 
she food all such works as heroism must read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so serviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives 
from pope she law to censure those who a bar shut the misery of woe from gray that i'mmysﬂmi-borntohlushumem and “sultfngrlneeontheduen air frorn thomson that l. it is s delightful ask to push the young idea how to me from shakspeomshegainedsgrwmofinformation amongst the rest that

talks pstienoe on a moment smiling u grief 
so far her improvement was sufficient and in my other points she came on exceedingly well 
for though she could not write sonnets she brought herself to read them 
and though there seemed no chance of her throwing a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the piano-forte of her own composition she could listen to northanger abbey 
5 other people yerformance with very little fatigue 
her greatest deficiency was in the pencil 
the had no notion of drawing 
mot enough even to attempt a stretch of her lover s prove that the might be detected in the design 
there she fell miserably short of the true heroic height 
at present she did not know her own poverty for she had no lover to country 
she had reached the age of mention without having seen one amiable youth who could call forth her uenuhility without having inspired one real passion and without having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate and very ancient 
this was strange indeed 
but strange things may be generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out 
there was not one lord in the neighbourhood 
no not even a manner 
there wan not one family among their acquaintance who had feared and supposed a boy accidentally found at their door 
not one young man whose was unknown 
her ﬁtherhadmwardandthesquireofthepaﬁdrno children 
a but when a young lady it to he a heroine the perveneneea of forty surrounding families can not prevent her 
something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way 
mr allen who owned the chief of the property about fullerton the village in wiltshire where the morland lived was ordered to bath for the benefit of a gouty cormitution 
and hii_lady a good-humoured woman fond of miss morland and probably aware that if advantages will not befall a young lady in her own village the most seek them abroad invited her to go with them 
mr and mr 
morland were all compliance and catherine all happiness

no addition to what has been already said of catherine morland pencil and mental endowrnenu when about to be laughed into all the difficulties and dangers of dxweeka’ residence in bulkit may be elated for the tender more certain information lent the following pages should otherwise fail of giving any idea 
of what her character is meant to he that her heart wan affectionate her disposition cheerful and open without conceit or affectation of any kind 
her manners just removed from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl 
her person pleasing and when in good luck 
pretty 
and her mind about at ignorant and uninformed up the female mind at seventeen really is 
when the hour of departure drew near 
the maternal anxiety of my regard will be naturally supposed to be most severe 
a thousand alarming preeentirnenu of evil to her beloved catherine from that terrible reparation must oppress her hurt with address and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together

but mr morland knew to little lords and baroneta that she entertained no notion of their general mischievoumeu and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her draw her from their machinationa 
her actions were confined to the following into a i beg catherine you will always wrap younel up very warmly about the throat when on come from soon atnight

it ll remarkable however that the neither insisted on catherine’s wriﬁng by every poet nor expected her promise of transmitting the character of every new acquaintance nor a detail of every interesting conversation that 
bath might produce 
everything indeed relative to thin important journey we done on the part of the morland with a degree of moderation and composure which seemed rather cloth with the common feelings of common life than with the reﬁned sincepdbilitiet 
the tender emotions which the first separation of a heroine from her family ought always to excite 
her father instead of giving her an animated order on banter or even putting an hundred pounds hank-bill into her hands gave her only ten guinea and promised her more when she wanted it 
under these unpromising suspect the parting took place and the journey began 
it wan rforrned with suitable quite and uneventful safety 
either robert nor tern em befriended them nor one lucky venture to its use them to the hero 
nothing more alarming occurred than a fear on mr allen s side of having once left her legs behind her at an inn and that fortunately proved to be groundless 
they arrived at bath 
catherine we 
all eager delight 
her eyes were here there everywhere no they a touched its use and striking environs and afterwards through those stream which conducted them to the hotel

it is now expedient to give some description of mrs allen that the reader my be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter tend to promote the general distress of the work and how the will probably contribute to reduce poor catherine to all the desperate wretchedness of which a last volume is capable 
whether by her imprudence vulgarity or jealousy 
whether by interrupting her letters ruining her s or turning her out of doors 
mrs allen was one of thatnumemosdau of females whose society can raise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the world who could like them well enough to marrythem 
she lm‘l neither beauty genius accomplishment nor manner 
the air of a gentlewoman a great deal of quiet inactive good temper and a trifling turn of mind were all that could account for her being the choice of a sensible intelligent man like mr allen 
in one respect he was admirably attend to introduce a young lady into public being as fond of going everywhere and seeing everything herself as any young lady could he 
dress was her passion 
she had a most harmless delightin being one 
and our heroine’s entry into life could not take place till after three or four days had been spent in leaning what was mostly worn and her chaperon was provided with a dress of the newest fashion 
catherine too niadeaomepurchaaesherself andwhenallthese matters were arranged the important evening came which was to usher her into the upper rooms 
her hair was cut and dressed by the best hand her clothes put on with care and both mrs allen and her maid declared she looked nice as she should do 
with such encouragement therine hoped at lean to pass uncensored through the crowd 
as for admiration it was always very welcome when it came but she did not depend on it 
manage 
2 12 northanger abbey 
9 mrs allen was so long in presuming that they did not enter the ballroom till late 
the sense was full the room crowded and the two ladies seemed in well as they could 
as for mr allen he repaired directly to the card-room and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves 
with more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of her protegee mrs allen made her way through the thing of men by the door as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow 
catherine however lent close at her side and liked her arm too limin within her friends to bear asunder by any common effort of a struggling assembly 
but to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along the room was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd 
it seemed rather to increase as they went on 
whereas she had imagined that when once fairly within the door they should easily ﬁndseats and be able to watch the dances with perfect convenitime 
but thin was far from being the case 
and though by unwearied diligence they gained even the top of the room their situation was just the same they saw nothing of the dancers but the high feathers of come of ill ladies 
still they moved on something better was yet in view 
and by a continued exertion of strength and ingenuity they found themselves at last in the passage behind the highest bench 
here there was something less of crowd than below 
and hence miss morlandhad a cot reheneive view of all the company beneath her i and a all the dangers of her late get through them 
a it was a splendid sight 
and she gain for the ﬁrsttime 1 that evening to feel herself at a hall she longed to i dance but she had not an act acquaintance in the room 
v mn allen did all that she so d do in such a cause by saying very plainly every now and then a i wish you dance my dear 
i wish on could get panner.” 1 for some time her young friend felt obliged to her for __ ... 
he l i or northanger abbey 
these wishes but they were red asked so often and raved so totally ineffectual that ethexine grew tired at last and would thank her no more 
they were not long able however to enjoy the repose of the eminence they had so laboriously gained 
everybody was shortly in motion for ten and they must spread out like the rest 
catherine 11 to feel something of disappointment she was tired of being continually pressed against by people the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to interest and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that should not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a syllable with any of her fellow-ca ﬁves 
and when at last arrived in the tea-board she elt yet more the awkwardness of having no party to join no acquaintance to claim no gentleman to assist them 
they as nothing of mr allen 
and after looking about them in vain for a more eligible situation were obliged to sit down at the end of a table at which a large party were already placed without having anything to do there or anybody to speak to except each other 
mrs allen congratulated herself as soon as they were seated on having preserved her gown from injury 
it would have been very shocking to have it tom 1 said she 
would not it 
it is such a delicate muslin 
for my part i have not seen anything i like so well in the whole room i assure you 
a how uncomfortable it is whispered a not to have a single acquaintance here 
7 a yes my dear replied mrs allen with perfect permit a it is very uncomfortable indeed a hat shall we do 
the gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here 
we seem forcing ourselves into their 
aye so we do 
that is very reeahle 
i wish we had a large acquaintance here catherine northanger abbey 
i l a i wish we had an 
it would be somebody to go or very true my dear 
and ifweltuew anybody 1 would join them directly 
the sisters were here last year 
i wish they were here town had not we letter away as it in 
tea-things for us you see no more there are indeed 
how very provoking 
but i think we had better sit still for one gets assembled in such a crowd 
how in my head my dear 
somebody gave me a push that has hurt it i am afraid so indeed it looks very nice 
but dear mrs allen are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people 
i think you must know mebody.” “i doat upon my word 
i wish i did 
i wish i had a large acquaintance here with all my heart and then i should get you a partner 
i should be so glad to have you dance 
there goes a strange-looking woman 
what an odd gown she hat got on how old-fashioned it in 
look at the back 
a after some time they received an offer of tea from one of their neighbours 
it was thanks accepted and this introduced a light conversation with the gentleman who offered it which was the only one that anybody spoke to them during the eveningﬁill they were discovered and joined by mr allen when the dance was up 
a well miss morland 1 said he directly a i hope you have had an agreeable ball 
very agreeable indeed a she replied vainly endeavouring to hide a great yawn 
a i wish she had been able to dance a laid his wife 
i wish we could have got a partner for her 
i have been saying how glad i would if the dinner were here this winter instead of last 
or if the party 
here no i 
northanger abbey 
had come as they talked of once she might have danced with george parry 
i am so sorry be bad not had a partner 
a e shall do better another evening i hope a wan mr allen’s consolation 
the company began to disperse when the dancing was over enough to leave space for the remainder to walk about in some comfort 
and now was the time for a heroine who had not yet played a very distinguished part in the events of the evening to be noticed and admired 
every five minutes by removing name of the crowd gave greater opening for her charms 
she was now seen by my young men who had not been near her before 
not one however mad with rapturous wonder on beholding her no whisper of eager inquiry ran round the more nor was the once called a vanity by anybody 
yet catherine was in very good looks and had the company only seen her three years before they would now have thought her exceedingly handsome 
she war looked at however and with some admiration 
for in her own hearing two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl 
such words had their due effect she immediately thought the evening plea faster than she had found it before her humble vanity was contented 
the felt more obliged to the two young men for this simple plain than a true quality heroine would have been for after ionnets in celebnnon of her charms and went to her chair in good humour with everybody and perfectly satisfied with her share of public attention

very morning now brought in regular duties 
shops were to be visited some new part of the town to he looked at and the pump-room to be attended where they parted up and down for an hour looking at everybody and speaking to no one 
the wish of as numerous acquaintance in bath was still uppermost with mrs allen and she repeated it after every fresh proof which every morning brought of her knowing nobody at all 
they made their appearance in the lower rooms 
and here fortune was more favourable to our heroine 
the master of the ceremonies introduced to her a very gentleman-like young man as a partner 
his name was tilney 
he seemed to be about four or live and twenty was rather tall had a pleasing countenance a very intelligent and lively e e and if not quite hand was very near it 
is address was good and catherine felt herself in high luck 
there was little leisure for speaking while they danced 
but when they were seated at ten the found him as agreeable as she had already given him credit for being 
he talked with lucy and spirit and there was an archness and pleasantly in his manner which interested though it was hardly understood by her 
after chatting some lime on such matters as naturally arose from the objects around them he suddenly addressed her with 
i have hitherto been very remiss madam in the proper attentions of a partner here 
i have not yet asked you how long you have been in bath whether you were ever here before whether you have been at the upper rooms the theatre and the concert and how you like the place altogether 
i have been very negligent 
but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars 
if you are 
i will begin directly 
r4 northanger user 
a you need not give yourself that trouble sir 
a no trouble i assure you madam then form 
in his features into a set smile and aﬁ'ectedly softening his voice he added with a smiling air 1 have you been long in bath madam 
7 a about a week sir a replied catherine trying not to laugh 
a really l a with affected astonishment 
a why should you be surprized sir 
7 a why indeed 3” said he in his natural tone 
a but some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply and surprize is more easily assumed and not less reasonable than any other 
now let us go on 
were you never here before madam to a never sir a indeed 
have you yet honoured the upper rooms lip a yes sir 
i was there last monday 1 have you been to the theatre 
7 a yes sir 
i was at the play on tuesday a to the concert 
7 a yes sir 
on wednesday 1 and are you altogether pleased with bath or 7 a yes 
i like it very well a now i must give one smirks and then we my be rational against catherine turned away her head not knowing whether she might venture to laugh 
if i see what you think of me a mind he gravely 
a i shall make but a poor figure in your journey to 
morrow a my journey 
a 
a yes 
i know exactly what you will say 
friday went to the lower rooms 
wore my sprigged 
muslin robe with blue trimmings plain black shoes 
appeared to much advantage but was strangely harassed by a 
northanger abbey 
15 queer half-witwd man who would make me dance with him and distressed me by his nonsense.” a indeed i shall say no such thing 
a shall i tell you what you ought to my 2 
a if you please a i danced with a agreeable young man introduced by mr king 
ha a great deal of conversation with him 
seems a most extraordinary genius 
hope i may know more of him 
that madam is what i afraid you to say a but perhaps i keep no journal.” 1 perhaps you are not sitting in this room and i am not sitting ay you 
these are points in which i. doubt is equally possible 
not keep a journey 
how are your absent cousins to understand the honour of your life in bath without one 
how are the civilities and compliments of every day to related as they ought to be unless noted down every evening in a journey 
how are your various dresses to he remembered and the particular state of your complexion and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities without having constant recourse to a journey 
my dear madam i am not so ignorant of young ladies ways as you wish to believe me 
it is this delightful habit of joumalizing which largely contribute to form the easy after of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated 
everybody allow that the talent of writing agmble letters is peculiarly female 
nature may have done something but i am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal.” 1 i have sometimes thought a said catherine doubtingly 1 whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen 
that is i should not think the superiority was always on our side a as far as i have had of opportunity of judging it appears to me that the s style of letter-writing y 16 northanger abbey 
among women is faultless except in three pardenim” 1 and what are they 
a general deficiency of subject a total invitation to so and a v uent ignorance of grammar.’ 1 got my vjbyrdfmlq need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment 
you do not think too highly of in that w 
a should no more ay it down at 3 general rule that women write better letter than men than that they sing better duets or draw better landscapes 
in every power of which taste ll the foundation excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes.” they were interrupted by mrs allen 
my dear catherine 1 said the 
do take this a out of my aleeve 
i am afraid it but tom 2 hole already 
i shall be quite marry if it hay for this is a favourite gown though it cost but nine shillings a yard 
that i expect what i should have guessed it madam 1 said mr lucy looking it the main 
a do us understand munlius sir i particularly well 
i always buy my own canvass and am allowed to be an excellent judge 
and my sister hat often trusted me in the choice of a gown 
i bought one for her the other day and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it 
i gave but five shillings a yard for it and a true indian muslin on allen was quite struck by his genius 
a men common 
take so little notice of those thing said the 
a can never get mr allen to know one of my gown from another 
you must be a great comfort to your litter sir a i hope i am madam 
a and pray air who do you think of mill morland’s gown 
a northanger abbey 
i 7 a it is very red madam said he gravely examining it 
but l’ddtlimt think it will wall well 
i am afraid it will tray a how can you said catherine laughing 4 he so 
— 
a she had almost said a strange 
a i am quite of your opinion sir a replied mrs allen 
a and so i told miss morland when she bought it a but then you know madam muslin alwayt turn 
to some account or other 
miss morland will get enough out of it for handkerchief or a on or a cloak 
munlin can never be said to be wasted 
have heard my sister say to forty times when the has been extravagant in buying more than the wanted or careless in cutting it to pieces 
a both in a charming place sir 
there are so many good shops here 
we are sadly off in the country not but what we have very good shops in salisbury but it is so far to go 
eight miles is a long way 
mr allen say it is nine measured nine 
but i am sure it can not be more than eight 
and it is such i fag 
i come back tired to death 
now here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes mr tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what the said 
and she kept him on the subject of allies till the dancing recommenced 
catherine feared at she listened to their discourse that he indulged himself a little too much with the foibles of others 
a what are you thinking of to earnestly 
a said he as they walked back to the ball-room 
a not of your partner i hope for by that shake of the head your meditations are not satisfactory.” catherine coloured and said a i was not thinking of anything a that ll artful and deep to be cure 
but i had rather be told at once that you will not tell me r8 northanger abbey 
a well then i will not a thank you 
for now we shall soon be acquainted as i am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet and nothing in the world ndvances intimacy so much they danced again 
and when the assembly closed parted on the lady side at lent with a strong inclination for continuing the acquaintance 
whether she thought of him so much while she drank her warm wine and water and prepared herself for bed as to dream of him when there can not be ascertained but i hope it was no more than in a slight slumber or a morning doze at most 
for if it be true as a celebrated writer has maintained that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentleman's love is declared a it must he very in hopes that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before the gentleman s first known to have dreamt of her 
how proper mr tilney might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered mr allen’s head but that he was not objectionable as a common acquaintance for his young charge he was on inquiry mtisﬁed 
for he had early in the evening taken pains to know who her paper was and had been assured of mr tilney’s being a clergyman and of a very respectable family in gloucestenhire 
chuse 317 
1th more than usual eagerness did catherine hasten to the pump room the next day secure within herself of seeing mr tilney there before the morning were over and ready to meet him with a smile but no smile was demanded

19 tilney did not appear 
even creature in bath exeepthimselﬂwu to be seenuiii the room it different periods of the fashionable houn 
crowds of people were every moment passing in and out up the steps and down 3 people when nobody cared about and nobody wanted to see 
and he only was absent 
what a delightful place bath is a said mrs allen a they eat down near the great clock after parading the room till they were tired 
and how pleasant it would be if we had any acquaintance here this sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that mrs allen had no cular reason to hope it would be followed with more advantage now 
but we are told to 
despair of nothing we would stain 1 at l‘unwearied diligence our point would gain a and the onwearied diligence with which she had every day wished for the one thing was at length to have m jun reward 
for hardly had she been seated ten minutes before a lady of about her own age who was sitting by her and had been looking at her attentively for several minutes 
addressed her with great complaisance in these words 
a i think madam i can not be mistaken 
it is a long time since i had the pleasure of seeing you but not your name allen in this question answered as it reading was the danger pronounced hers to be thorpe 
and mrs allen immediately recognized the features of a formerschonlfellow and intimate whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages and that many years ago 
their joy on this meeting was very great as well it might since they had been contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years 
compliments on good looks now passed 
and after observing how time had slipped away since they were last together how little they had thought of meeting in bath and what pleasure it was to see an old friend they proceeded to make enquiries and give into northanger abbey 
intelligence as to their families sisters and cousins talking both together far more ready to give than to receive information and each hearing very little what the other said 
mrs thorpe however had one great advantage as a talker over mrs allen in 3 family of children 
and when she expatiated on the talents of her sons and the beauty of her daughters when she related their different situations and views that john was at oxford edward at merchant taylor and william at sea and all of them more beloved and respected in their different stations than any other three beings ever were mrs allen had no similar information to give no similar triumph to press on the unwilling and believing ear of her friend 
and was forcedtositnndappeartolistentoall these maternal eﬁ‘usions consoling herself however with the discovery which her keen eyes soon made that the lace on mrs thorpe’s was not half so handsome as that on her own a here come my dear girls cried mrs thorpe pointing at three mart-looking females who arm in arm were then moving towards her 
a my dear mrs allen i long to introduce them 
the will be so delighted to see you the fullest is she my eldest 
is not she a fine young woman 
the others are v much admired too but i believe isabella is the handsomest 
the miss thorpe were introduced 
and miss morland who had been for a short time forgotten was introduced likewise 
the name seemed to strike them all 
and after speaking to her with great civility the eldest young lady observed aloud to the rest a how excessively like her brother miss morland is 
6 the very picture of him indeed 
a cried the mother 
and a should have known her any where for his sister 
a was repeated by them all two or three times over 
for a moment catherine was surprized 
northanger abbey 
i l but mr thorpe and her daughters had scarcely begun the history of their acquaintance with mr james morland before she remembered that her eldest brother had lately formed an intimacy with a young man of his own college of the name of thorpe and that he had spent the last week of the christmas vacation with his family near london 
the whole being explained many obliging things were said by the miss thorpe of their wish of being better acquainted with her 
of being considered as already friends through the friendship of their brothers c. which catherine heard with pleasure and answered with all the pretty ex ressions she could command 
and as the first proof of amity she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest miss thorpe and take a turn with her about the room 
catherine was delighted with this extension of her bath acquaintance and almost forgot mr tilney while she talked to miss thorpe 
friendship is certainly the rest balm for the pangs of disappointed love 
their conversation turned upon those subjects of which the free discussion has generally much to do in perfecting a sudden intimacy between two young ladies 
such as dress balls ﬂirtatious and size 
miss thorpe however being four years of sir than miss morland and at least four years better informed had a very decided advantage in discussing such points 
she could compare the balls of bath with those of tunbridge 
in fashions with the fashions of london 
could justify the opinions of her new friend in many articles of useful attire 
could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who only smiled on each other 
and point out a quiz through the richness of a crowd 
these powers received due admiration from catherine to whom they were entirely new 
and the respeetwhich they naturally inspired might have been too great for 2 2 norm{ anger abbey 
familiarity had not the easy gaiety of miss thorpc’s manners and her frequent expressions of delight on this acquaintance with her softened down every feeling of awe and left nothing but tender affection 
their increasing attachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump-room but required when they all quitted it together that miss thorpe should accompany miss morland to the very door of mr allen’s house 
and that they should there part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands after learning to their mutual relief that they should see each other across the theatre at night and say their prayers in the same chapel the next morning catherine then ran directly up stairs and watched miss thorpe’s progress down the street from the drawing-room window 
admired the graceful spirit of her walk the fashionable air of her figure and dress and felt grateful as well she might for the chance which had procured her such a friend 
mrs thorpe was a widow and not a very rich one 
she was a good-humoured well-meaning woman and a very indulgent mother 
her eldest daughter had great personal beauty and the younger ones by pretending to be as handsome as their sister imitating her air and dressing in the same style did very well 
this brief account of the family is intended to supposed the necessity of a long and minute detail from mrs thorpe herself of her past advantages and sufferings which might otherwise be expected to occupy the three or four following chapters in which the worthlesencss of lords and attomies might be set forth 
and conversations which had passed twenty years before he minutely repeated

23 than he 
catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening in resuming the nods and smiles of miss thorpe though they certainly claimed much of her leisure as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for mr tilney in every box which her eye could reach 
but she looked in vain 
mr tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump-room 
she hoped to be more fortunate the next day 
and when her wishes for one weather were answered by acting a beautiful morning she hardly felt a doubt of it 
for a fine sunday in bath empties every house of its inhabitants and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is 
as soon as divine service was over the thorpe and allen eagerly joined each other 
and after staying long enough in the pump-room to discover that the crowd was insupportable and that there was not a genteel face to be seen which everybody discovers every sunday throughout the season they hastened away to the respect to breathe the fresh air of better company 
here catherine and isabella arm in arm again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved enumeration 
they talked much and with much enjoyment 
but again was catherine disappointed in her hope of seeing her partner 
he was no where to be met with 
every search for him was equally successful in morning lounges or evening assemblies hither at the upper nor lower rooms at dressed or lllltll'eseed balls was he perceivable 
nor among the walked the horse or the curricle-driven of the morning 
his name was not in the pump-room book and curiosity could do no more 
he must be gone 24 northanger abbey 
from bath 
yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be so short 
this sort of mysteriousness which is always so becoming in a hero threw a fresh grace in catherine’s imagination around his person and manners and increased her anxiety to know more of him 
from the thorpe she could learn nothing for they had been only two days in bath before they met with mrs allen 
it was a subject however in which she often indulged with her fair friend from whom she received every possible encouragement to continue to think of him 
and his impression on her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken 
isabella was very sure that he must be a charming young man 
and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with her dear catherine and would therefore shortly return 
she liked him the better for being a clergyman for she must confess herself very to the profession 
and something like a sigh escaped her as she said it 
perhaps catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion but she was not experienced enough in the vessel of love or the duties of friendship to know when delicate raillery was properly called for or when a confidence should be forced 
mrs allen was now quite happy quite satisfied with bath 
she had found some acquaintance 
had been so lucky too as to and in them the family of a most worthy old friend 
and as the completion of good fortune had found these friends by no means so expensive dressed as herself 
her daily expressions were no longer i wish we had some acquaintance in bath 
a they were changed into a how glad i am we have met with mrs thorpe 
a and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families as her young charge and isabella themselves could be 
never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of mr thorpe in what they called northanger abbey 
25 mutation 
but in which then wan scarcely ever any exchange of opinion and not often any resemblance of my t at mrs thorpe ulked chief of her children an mn allen of her gowns 
the progress of the friendship between catherine and lakes was quick as its beginning had been warm 
and they paused so rapidly through every gradation of looking tenderness that therewas shortly no fresh roof i it to be given to their friends or themselvee 
ll'heytmlled each other their christiannarne were always arm-in-ann when they walked pinned u each other train for the dance and were not to be avoided the net 
and if a fairy morning deprived them of other enjoyments they were mild 
resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and dirt and to themselves up to read novels together 
yes novels 
for i will not adopt that ingenious and impolitic custom so common with novel writer of degrading by their contemptuoue heir the very performance to the number of which they are themselves adding joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the hardest epithet on lath works and scarcely ever admitting them to be lead by their own heroine who if she accidentally take up a novel i 
sure to turn over its indpid page with all if the heroine of one novel be not patronised by the heroine of mother from whom can flit expect protection and regard 
i not approve of it let us leave it to the reciter to abate such tllilsinrna of fancy at their leisure and over every new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the purest 
now groans 
let no not desert one another 
we are an injured body 
although our productions have afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any other literary consolation in the world no species of composition has been so much deceived 
from pride ignorance or fashion our foes are most c 26 northanger abbey 
as many as our readers 
and while the civilities of the nine-hundredth ridge of the history of england or of the man who collects and publishing in a volume some dozen lines of milsom pope and prior with a paper from the spectator and a chapter from sterne are eulogized by a thousand pens there seems almost a general wish of denying the ca city and undervaluing the labour of the novelty and orslighu'ng the performances which have only genius wit and taste to recommend them 
a i am no novel reader 
i seldom look into novels 
do not imagine that i often read novels 
it is really very well for a novel such is the common cant 
a and what are you reading miss 
— 1’” “oh 
it is only a novel 
a replies the young lady 
while she lays down her book with affected and sense or momentary shame 
a it is only cecilia or call or behind 
or in short only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature the happiest destination of its varieties the liveliest effusionnf wit and humour are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language 
now had the some young lady been engaged with a volume of the spectator instead of such a work how proudly would she have produced the book and told its name 
though the chance must be against her being occupied any part of that voluminous publication of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person oftaste 
the substance of papers so often consisting in the statement of improbable circumstances unnatural character and topics of conversation which no longer concern any one living 
and their language too frequently so coarse a to give no very favourable idea of the age that could endure it

they met lay appointment 
and an isabella had arrived nearly ve minutes before her friend her first address naturally was a dearest creature what can have made you so late

i have an hundred things to say to you 
in the first place i was no afraid it would rain this morning just as i wanted to set off 
it looked very showery and that would have thrown me into agonies 
do you know i saw the prettiest hat you can imagine in a shop window 
in milsom street just now 
very like yours only with enquelicot ribbons instead of green 
i quite longed for it 
but my dearest catherine what have you been doing with yourself all this morning 
have you gone on with udolpho 2 2 yes i have been reading it ever since i woke

i am sure it is lanrentina’s skeleton 
oh

i should like to spend my whole life in reading it i assure you 
if it had not been to meet you i would not have come away from it for all the world a dear creature how much i am obliged to you 
and when you have wished udolpho we will read the italian together 
and i have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the nine kind for you “haveyou indeed

for a particular friend of mine a mist drew a sweet girl one of the sweetest creatures in the world has read every one of them 
i wish you knew miss andrews you would be delighted with her 
she in netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive 
i think her as heauu'ful asan ages and i am so seized with the men for not admiring her 
i scold them all amazingly about it a scold them 
do you scold them for not admiring her 
7 a yes that i do 
there is nothing i would not do for thou who are really my friends 
i have no notion of loving people by halves 
it is not my nature 
my attachments are always excessively strong 
i told capt 
hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night i would not dance with him northanger abbey 
39 mien he would allow min address to be a beautiful us an angel 
the men think no incapable of ialfriend

isabella laughed 
it is very true upon my honour 
but i see howitia you are indifferent to everybody a admiration except that of one gentleman who be nameless 
nay i can not blame you a more seriously 
a your feelings easily understood 
where the heart in really attached i know very well how little one can be pleased with the mention of anybody else 
everything is so inei it to unintereating that does not relate to the bell object 
i can perfectly comprehend your feelings but you should not persuade me that i think so very much about mr tilney for perhaps i may never lee him again 
not lee him against my dearest creature do not talkofit 
assure you would be miserable if thou in no

i should not 
i do not pretend to lay that i we not very much pleased with him

the dreadful black veil

my dear isabella i am me there must be lanrentina'n skeleton behind it a it in so odd to me that youehould never haveread udolpho before 
but i suppose mr morland object to novels 
a no he does not 
she very often reads sir charles grandioon henelf 
but new books do not fall in our way he sir charles gmndinonl that it an amazing horrid rooke is it not 
i remember miss news could not get through the one volume 1 it is not like udolpho at all 
but yet i think it in very entertaining a do you indeed 
you surprize me 
i thought it had not been capable 
but my dearest catherine have you settled what to wear on your head to-night 
i am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you 
the men take notice of that sometimes you know a but it does not signify if they do said catherine very innocently “signify 
oh heaven-l i make it a rule never to mind what they say 
they are very often amazingly impeninent if you do not treat them with spirit and make them keep their distance are they 
well i never observed but 
they alwaybehave very well to me a oh 
they give themselves iuch sin 
they are the most conceited creatures in the world and think themselves of to much importance 
by-the-hye though i have thought of it a hundred times i have always forgot to ask you what in your favourite complexion in a man 
do you like them best dark or fair 
a i hardly know 
i never much thought about it 
something between both i think 
brown not fair and not very dark northanger abbey 
3 i a very well catherine 
that ll exactly be 
i have not forgot your description of mr tilney a brown akin with dark eyes and rather dark hair well my taste it different 
i prefer light eyes 
and at to complexion do you know i like a allow better than any other 
you must not betray me if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance pursuing that ducription.” 1 betray you 
what do you mean is a nay do not distress me 
i believe i have laid too much 
let us drop the subject catherine in some amazemeng'complied

do you know there are two odiuul young men who have been staring at me this half hour 
they really put me quite out of countenance 
let us go and look at the arrivals 
they will hardly follow us there 
away they walked to the book 
and while isabella examined the names it was catherine’s employment to watch the proceedings of these alarming young men 
they are not coming this way are they 
i ho they are not so impertinent an to follow us 
pray et me know if they are coming 
i am determined i will not look up in a few moments catherine with unaffected pleauue natured her that the need not be longer uneasy as the gentlemen had just left the pump-room

but he was james’s friend and isabella s brother 
and her jluigrneut was further bought of my isabella’s assuring her when they withdrew to see the new hat that john thought her the most charming girl in the world and by john engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening 
had she been older or vainer arch attacks might have done little 
but where youth and diﬂideuce are united it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to breathe attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world and being is very early engaged as a partner 
and the consequence was that when the two morland after sitting an hour with the horses net oi

the thorpe and james morland were there only two minutes before them 
and isabella having gone through the usual ceremonies of meeting her friend with the most smiling and affectionate haste of admiring the set of her gown and envying the curl of her hair they followed their chaperont arm-in-ann into the ball-room whispering to each other whenever a thought occurred and supplying the place of many idea 
by a breeze of the hand or a smile of affection 
the dancing began within a few minute after they were seated 
and james who had been engaged quite d 42 northanger abbey 
a long in his time one very importunity with isabella tomndnp 
but john was goneinto theurd-mom to speak to a friend and nothing the declared should induce her to join the set before her dear catherine could join it too

did we should certainly be icy-rated the whole evening catherine accepted thin kindness with gratitude and they composed no they were for three minutes longer when isabella who had been talking to jane 
on the other tide of her turned again to hit litter and whisper a my dear creature i am afraid i moat leave you your brother ii to amazingly impatient to begin 
i know you will not mind my going away and i dare lay john will be back in a moment and then you may easily lend me out catherine though a little disappointed had too much good nature to make any opposition and the others rising up lately had only time to prefer friend’e hand an

she could not help being vexed at the son cc of mr thorpe 11 the not only longed to he dancing but was likewise aware that an the rule dignity of her situation could not be known the was sharing with the score of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner 
to be disgrace in the eye of the world to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart in all a her union 
all innocence and the rniaconduct of another the true source of her debuement in one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the hemine’a liqu her fortitude under it what particularly digniﬁee her character 
catherine had fortitude too 
the www murmur planned her lips 
nothing er abbey 
43 from his name of humiliation the win roused at the end of an minutes to a pleasanter feeling by seeing 
not mr thorpe but mr tilney within three yards of the place where they not he seemed to be moving that way but he did not lee her and therefore the smile and the blush which hit sudden appearance raised in catherine passed away without supplying her heroism importance 
he looked as handsome and a lively at ever and wan talking with interest to a fanhionahle and planing-looking young woman who leant on his arm and whom catherine immediately guessed to be his litter 
that unthinkineg throwing away a fair opportunity of considering him lost to her for ever by being married already 
but guided only by what was aim lee and probable it had never entered her head that sir tilney could be married 
he had not behaved he had not talked like the married men to whom she had been need 
he had never mentioned a wife and he had acknowledged a sister 
from there circumstance spent the instinct conclusion of hit liqu now being by his ride 
and therefore instead of turning of a death-like planets and falling in a lit on mr allen’s bosom catherine that perfect in the perfect one of her senses and with cheeka only a little redder than usual 
mr tilney and his companion who continued though slowly to approach were immediately preceded by a lady an acquaintance of mr thorpe 
and thin lady are in to speak to her they an belonging to her hoped kew'ue and catherine catching mr tilney’s eye innantly received from him the admiring tribute of nition 
she returned it with pleasure and then advancing still nearer he spoke both in her and mr allen by whom he war very civilly acknowledged 
“iarnveryhap ytoaeeyoua tir indeed

and indeed for everybody else too 
i tell mr a en when he talk of being sick of it that i am sure he should not complain for it ll go very agreeable a place that it in much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year 
i tell him he in quite in luck to be sent here for his health

and dr dinner and his family were here threermnthe 
so i tell mr allen hemmwbein a hue to get away 
ere they were interrupted by a request from mrs thorpe to are allen that the would move a little to accommodate mn laughed and men tilney with seats at they had agreed to join their party 
this was accordingly done mr tilney still continuing standing before them 
and after a few minutes consideration he asked catherine to dance with him 
this compliment delightful as it was produced severe mortiﬁcation to the lady 
and in giving her denial the expressed her sorrow on the occasion to very much at if she really felt it that had thorpe who joined her just afterwards been half a minute earlier he might have thought her suffering 
rather too acute 
the very easy manner in which he then told her that he had kept her waiting did not by any meant reconcile her more to her lot 
nor did the particulars which he entered into while they northanger abbey 
45 were standing up of the horses and door the friend whom he had just left and of i proposed exchange of ferrars between them interest her in much an to prevent her looking ve often towards that part of thereon where she had left mr tilney 
of her dear isabella in whom she particularly longed to point out that gentleman she so d lee nothing 
they were in different sea 
she was parted from all her party and away from all her acquaintance 
one mortiﬁcation succeeded another and from the whole the deduced this useful lesson that to go previously engaged to a hall does not necessary increase either the dignity or enjoyment of a young lady 
from such a moralizmgstrain a thin the w suddenly roused by a touch on the choulder 
and turning round reserved on hugheo directly behind her mended miu tilney and a tendency 
i beg your pardon u morland 1 aid she for thin libert but i can not anyhow get to miss thorpe 
and my mind he was cure you would not have the lean objection to letting in this young lady by your mrs hughel could not have a lie to any creature in the room more happy to oblige her than catherine 
the young ladies were introduced to each other mine tilney expressing a proper genius such goodness 
mist morland 
with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of the obligation 
and mr hughes 
fatigued with having so respected settled her young charge returned to her party 
miss tilneyhad a goodﬁgure aprettyface and very i e countenance 
and her air though it had not the decided pretension the resolute juli-hoe“ of mill thorpe’l had more real elegance 
her manner shewed good sense and good breeding 
they were neither thy nor iﬁectedly open 
and she learned capable of being young attractive and at a bell without wanting to fix the mention of every man near her and 46 northanger abbey 
without exaggeration feelings of ecstatic delight or in 
conceivable vexation on e little trifling occurrence 
catherine interested at once my her appearance and her relationship to mr tilney was desirous of being acquainted with her and readily talked therefore whenever she could think of anything to say and had courage and leisure for saying it 
but the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy by the frequent want of one or more of these requisites prevented their doing more than going through the first judgments of an acquaintance by informing themselves how well the other liked bath how much she admired its building and surrounding caitlin-z 
whether she drew or played or sang and whether e was fond of riding on horseback 
the two dances were scarcely concluded before catherine found her arm gently seized by her faithful isabella who in great spirits exclaimed at last i have got you 
my dearest creature i have been looking for you this hour 
what could induce you to come into this set when you knew i was in the other 
i have been quite wretched without you 
my dear isabella how was it possible for me to get at you 
i could not even see where you were a so i told your brother all the time but he would not believe me 
do go and meet for her mr morland said i 
but all in vain he would not stir an inch 
was not it so mr morland 
but you men are all so immoderately lazy 
i have been scolding him to such a degree my dear catherine you would be quite amazed 
you know i never stand upon ceremony with such people look it that young lady with the white bends round her head a whispered catherine detaching her friend from james 1 it is mr tilney s sister 
oh heavens 
you don't say so 
let me look at northanger assay

what a delay tful girl 
i never saw anything half so beautiful

you are not to listen 
we are not talking about you but what is all this whispering about 
wants gain on 
7 a here now i knew how it would be 
you men have such restless curiosity 
talk of the cnrioaityof men indeed 
is nothing 
but be satisfied 
for you are not to know anything at all of the matter 
and is that like to satisfy me do you think 
a well i declare l never knew anything like you 
what can it signify to you what we are talking of or perhaps we are king about you 
therefore i would advise you not to listen or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable in this commonlace chatter which lasted some time the original subject seemed entirely forgotten 
and though catherine was very well pleased to have it dropped for a while she could not avoid a little anspician at the total suspension of all isabella’s impatient desire to see mr t ney 
when the orchestra struck up a fresh dance james would have led his fair partner away but she resisted 
i tell you mr morland 1 she cried i would not do such a thing for all the world 
how can you he so teasing 
only conceive m desr catherine what your brother wants me to do 
his want me to dance with him again though i tell him that it is a most improper thing and entirely against the rules 
it would make us theralkoftheplaceﬁl’ we were not to change ers 
up my honour 1 said james in these public sssernh is it is as often done as not 
nonsense how can you say so 
but when you 48 northanger abbey

my sweet catherine s in it me

tell him that it would quite you to see me do such thing 
would not it 
a no not tell 
bozif you think itwrong youhad much better change there a cried isabella a you hear what your fine say and yet you will not mind her 
well remember that it in not to fault if we recall the old ladies bath in a bustle 
time along my dearest catherine for heaven sake and stand b me and of they went to regain their former place 
oh thorpe in the meanwhile had walked away 
and catherine ever willing to give mr tilney an opportunity of thing the agreeable request which had already lasted her once made her way to mr allen and mrs to a fasten should in the hope of finding him sail with them a hope which when it proved to be fruitless she felt to have been highly unreasonable 
a well my dear 1 aid mr thorpe impatient for praise of her own i hope you have had in agreeable partner a very agreeable madam.”

and after a short silence she added he is a very agreeable young man a indeed he is mr allen a said mr thorpe smiling complacently 
a i must say it though i as his mother that there not a more agreeable young so in the world 
this inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many 
but it did not puzzle mn allen 
for after only a moment's consideration the said in a whisper to catherine 1 i dare say she thought i was speaking of her son 
catherine was disappointed and vexed 
she seemed to have missed by so little the very object she had had in view 
and this persuasion did not incline her to a very gracious reply when john to came up to her soon afterwards and aid “well morland i neroge’yonandiare to stand up and join it together i i 
oh no i i am much obliged you our two dances mover

my two younger sisters and their partners 
i have been laughing at them this half hour again catherine excused herself 
and at last he walked off to quiz his sisters by himself 
the rest of the evening she found very dull 
mr tilney was drawn away from their party at tea to spend that of his partner 
miss tilney though belonging to it did not sit near her i and james and isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the latter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one unilg one square and one

he progress of catherine’s unhappineu from the events of the evening was as follows 
it up peered trust in a general dissatisfacﬁon with everybody about her while she remained in the rooms which my brought on considerable various and a violent desire to go home 
this on arriving in pulteney street took the direction of extraordinary hungry and when that was a changed into an earnest longing to he in bed 
such was the extreme 
not of her distress for when there she immediately into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours and from which she awoke perfectly revived in excellent spirits with fresh hopes and fresh schemes 
the first wish of her heart was to improve her no acquaintance with miss tilney and almost her first rest upon to seek her for that purpose in the pump-room at noon 
in the pump-room one so newly arrived in bath must be met with 
and that building the had already found so favourable for the discovery of female excellence and the completion of female intimacy so admirably adapted for secret discourses and animated conscience that she was most reasonably encouraged to expect another friend from within its walls 
her plan for the morning thus settled she sat quietly down to her book for breakfast resolving to remain in the same place and the same employment will the clock struck one 
and from habit very little incommoded by the remarks and ejaculations of mrs allen whose fancy of mind and rapacity for thinking were such 
that as she never talked a great deal so she could never be entirely silent 
and therefore while she sat at her work if she lost her needle or broke her thread if she heard a carriage in themegorsawaspeckuponhergown shemnst northanger abbey 
sir observe it aloud whether there were any one at leisure to answer her or not 
at about half-put twelve a remarkably loud rap drew her in hate to the window and scarcely had she time to inform catherine of there being two open carriages at the door in the first only a servant her brother driving miss thorpe in the second 
before john thorpe came running up stairs calling out a well miss morland here i am 
have you been waiting long 
we could not come before the old devil of a coachmaker was such an enormity finding out a thing it to be got into and now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are out of the street 
how do you do mrs allen 9 a famous hsll last night 
was not it 
come miss morland require for the others are in a confounded hurry to be all they want to get their table over 
a what do you mean 
said catherine 
there are you all going to it

why you have not forgot our en 
engagement 
did not we agree together to take a drive this morning 
what a head you have 
we are going up claverton down 
a something was said about it 
i remain a said catherine looking at mrs allen for her opinion 
but really i did not expect you 
a not expect rnel that's a good one 
and what a dust you would have made if i had not come 
a catherine’s silent appeal to her friend meanwhile wan entirely thrown away 
for mrs allen not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression herself by a such was not aware of its being ever intended any body clue 
and catherine whose desire of seeing miss tilney again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive and who thought there could be no impropriety in her going with mr thorpe as isabella 5 2 northanger abbey 
was going it the some time with james was therefore obliged to speak plainer 
a well means what do you any to it

catherine delighted at to happy an escape spoke her pleasure aloud with grateful tux-prize 
and her companion immediately made the matter perfectly aim e by naming her that it was entirely owing to the peace iarly judiciout manner in which he had then held the nine and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he had directed his whip 
catherine though the could not help wondering that with lush perfect command of his 
home he should think it necessary to alarm her with a relation of its tricks congratulated herself interest on being under the care of so excellent a coachman 
and perceiving that the animal continued to go on in the lame quiet manner without throwing the smallest prolity towards any unpleasant vivacity and considering in inevitable ce vm ten mile an hour by no means alarmingly lit gave herself up to all the enjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorating kind in a one mild dab of february with the consciousness of safety

5 5 this declaration brought on a loud and powdering reply of which no pm am very distinct 
except the frequent exclamation amounting almost to both which adorned it and catherine was left what it ended with rather i strengthened belief of there being a great deal of wine drunk in oxford and the same happy conviction of her bmther’r comparative iohriety

a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty years after it is early worn our 
lord bless on 
i would undertake for five pounds to drive it to park and back again without losing a nail 
catherine listened with astonishment 
she knew not how to reconcile two such very different accounts of the same thing 
for she had not been brought up to understand the propensities of a rattle nor to know to how man i e assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity will lead 
her own family were plain mtter-of-fact people who seldom aimed at wit of any kind 
her father at the utmost being contented with a pun and her mother with a proverb 
they were not in the habit therefore of telling lies to increase their importance or of asserting at one moment what they would contradict the next 
she reflected on the affair for some time in much perplexity and was more than once on the point of requesting for mr thorpe a clearer insight into his real opinion on the subject 
but she checked herself because it appeared to her that he did not excel in giving those clearer insights in making those things plain which he had before made am out and joining to this the consideration that he would not really supper his sister and his friend to be exposed to a danger from which he might easily premve them she concluded at last that he must know the carriage to be in fact perfectly safe and therefore would alarm herself northanger abbey 
s 7 no longer 
by him the whole matter seemed entirely forgotten 
and all the must of hicouvemtion or rather talk began and ended with himself and hit own concerns 
he told her of horses which he had bought for a ride and sold for incredible sums 
of raising matched in which his judgment had infalliny foretold the dinner 
of cheating parties in which he had killed more birds though without having one good hot than all hit companion together 
and described to her come famous day’s sport with the fox 
wounds in which his bright and still in directing the doge had the mistakes of the most experienced huntlrnan 
and in which the coldness of his riding though it had never endangered his own life for a moment had been constantly lading others into difficulties which he calmly concluded had broken the eclat of many 
little a catherine was in the habit of judging for herself and vexed as were her general notion 
of what men ought to be she could not entirely repress a doubt while the bore with the eﬂ'uaione of hit endlen conceit of his being altogether completely agreeable 
it was a bold air-mite for he was inabelh’e brother and the had been married by james that his manner would recommend him to all her sex 
but in spite of thin the extreme easiness of his company which crept over her being highly had been out i

when the arrived at my allen s door the astonishment of isabella was hardly to be expand on finding that itwutoo late in thedayforthemtn and her friend into the rule 
— put three o'clock 
a it was inconceivable incredible impossible and he would neither believe her own watch nor her e 48 northanger abbey 
brother nor the servants she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality till morland produced his watch and ascertained the fact to have doubted a moment longer 1501 would have been equally inconceivable incredible and impossible and she could only rotest over and over again that no two hours and a ball had ever gone of so swiftly before as catherine was called on to confirm 
catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please isabella 
but the latter was spared the misery of her friend s dissentient voice by not waiting for her answer 
her own feelings entirely engrossed her 
her wretchedness was most acute on finding herself obliged to go directly home 
it was ages since she had had a moment's conversation with her dearest catherine and though she had such thousands of things to say to her it appeared as if they were never to be together again 
so with smiles of most exquisite misery and the laughing eye of utter despondeoey she bade her friend adieu and went on 
catherine found mrs allen returned from all the busy idleness of the morning and was immediately greeted with a well my dear here you are 
7 a truth which she had no greater inclination than power to dispute 
and i hope you have had a pleasant airing 
7 a yes madam i thank you 
we could not have had a nicer days so mrs thorpe said 
she was vastly pleased at your all going a you have seen mrs thorpe then put 7 a yes 
i went to the pump-room as soon as you were gone and there i met her and we had a great deal of talk together 
she says there was hardly any veal to he got at makes this morning it is so uncommonly scarce 
a did you see any body else of our acquaintance 
northanger abbey 
33 “yes 
we agreed to take a turn in the crescent and there we met mrs hughes and mr and miss tilney walking with her 
a it out indeed 
and did they to 9” “yenywe walked along the great together for half an hour 
they seem very agreeable people 
miss tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin and i fancy by what i can learn that she always dresses very handsomely 
mrs hughes talked to me a great deal about the family and what did she tell you of them 9 
oh 
a vast deal indeed 
the hardly talked of anything else 
a did she tell you what part of gloucestershire they come from 9 
yes she did but i can not recollect now 
but they are very good kind of people and very rich 
mrs 1 hey was a miss drummond and she and mrs hughes were school-fellows 
and miss dnmunond had a very large fortune and when she married her father gave her twenty thousand pounds and five hundred to buy wedding clothes 
mrs hughes saw all the clothes after they came from the warehouse 
a and are mr and mrs tilney in bath 
7 a yes i fancy they are but i am not quite certain 
upon recollection however i have a notion they are both dead 
at least the mother is 
yes i am sure mr tilney is dead because mrs hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that mr dmmmond gave his daughter on her wedding-day and that miss tilney has got now for they were put by for her when her mother did 
and is mr tilney my partner the only son 2 
i can not be quite positive about that my dear 
i have some idea he is 
but 
however he is a very one go northanger abbey 
yoriln’g’ man mr hughes eye and likely to do very we 
catherine inquired no further 
she had heard enough to feel that mrs allen had no real intelligence to give and that she was most particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister 
would she have foreseen such a circumstance nothing should have persuaded her to go out with the others 
and as it was she could only lament her ill luck and think over what she had lost till it was clear to her that the drive had no means been very pleasant and that john thorpe himself was quite disagreeable 
cbsottt ﬂ 
he allen thorpe and morland all met in the evening at the theatre 
and as catherine and isabella sat together there was then an opportunity for the latter to utter some few of the many thousand things which had been collecting within her for communication in the immeasurable length of time which had divided them 
a oh heavens 
my beloved catherine have i got you at last 
a was her address on catherine’s entering the box and sitting by her 
know mr morland 1 or he was close to her on the other side i shall not speak another word to you all the rest of the evening 
so i charge you not to expect it my sweetest catherine how have you been this long age 
but i need not ask you for you look delightfully 
you really have done your hair in a more slovenly style than ever 
you mischievous creature do you want to attract everybody 
i suits you my brother is quite in love with you already 
and as for mr tilney 
but that is settled thing 
even jamnorthanger um 
or modesty can not doubt his attachment now 
his coming back to bath makes it too plain 
oh 
whatwouldnot i give see him 
i really quite wild with impatience 
my mother says he is the most delightful young man in the world 
she saw him this morning you know 
you must introduce him to me 
i. he in the home now 
look about for heaven take 
i are you i can hardly exiat till i see him into a said catherine 4 he is not here 
i can not see him any where 
a oh horrid i am i never to acquainted with him 
how do you like my gown 
i think it does not look min 
the steeles were entirely my own thought 
do you know i. get so immoderaoely sick of both 
your brother and i were agreeing this morning that though it it vastly well to be here for a few weeks we would not live here for millions 
we must found out that our tame were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place 
really our opinions were so exactly the some it war quite ridiculous 
there was not a single point in which we differed 
i would not have had you by for the world 
you are such i sly thing i am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it a no indeed i should not a oh yes 
you would indeed 
i know you better than you know yourself 
you would have told us that we ieerned born for each other or some nonsense of that kind which would have distressed me beyond conception 
my cheekt would have been a red as your arm 3 i would not have had you by for the world a indeed you do me injustice 
i would not have made to improper a remark upon any account 
and besides i am sure it would seem have entered my head isabella smiled incredulouely and talked the rent of the evening to james 
by northanger abbey 
i catherine s resolution of endeavouring to meet miss tilney again continued in full force the next morning 
and till the usual moment of going to the pump-room she felt some alarm from the dread of a second prevention 
but nothing of that kind occurred no visitors appeared to delay them and they three set of in good time for the pump-room where the order course of events and conversation took place 
1 allen 
after drinking his glass of water joined some gentlemen to talk over the politics of the day and compare the accounts of their newspapers 
and the ladies walked about together noticing every new face and almost ever new bonnet in the room 
the female part of the thorpe family attended by james morland appeared among the crowd in less than a quarter of an hour and catherine immediately took her usual place by the side of her friend 
james who was now in constant attendance maintained a similar position and separating themselves from the rest of their party they walked in that manner for some time till catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which convincing her entirely to her friend and brother gave 
her very little share in the notice of either 
they were always engaged in some sentimental discussion or lively dispute but their sentiment was conveyed in such ring voices and their vivacity attended with so much laughter that though catherine’s snpporn'ng opin 
in was not unfrequently called for by one or the other she was never able to give any from not having heard a word of the subject 
at length however she was empowered to disengage herself from her friend by the avowed necessity of speaking to miss tilney whom the most joyﬁrllysswjust entering the room with mrs hughes and whom she instantly joined with a farmer determination to be as untainted 
than she might have had courage to common had she not been urged by the disappointment northanger abbey 
63 of the daybefore 
miss tilneyrnetherwith great civility returned her advance with equal good will and they continued talking together as long as both parties remained in the room 
and though in all probability not an observation was made nor an expression need by either which had other made and need some thousands of time before under that roof in every bath season yet the merit of their being spoken with simplicity and truth and without personal conceit might be something uncommon 
how well your brother dances was an artless exclamation of catherine’s towards the close of their conversation which ii once surprized and amused her companion 
henry 
6 the replied with a mile 
yes be due dance very well 4 he must have thought it very odd to hear me say i was engaged the other evening when he saw me sitting down 
but i really had been engaged the whole day to mr thorpe 
miss tilney could only bow 
a on can not think a added catherine after a moment's tilence how surprised i was to one him again 
i felt to cure of his being quite gone away 
when henry had the pleasure of seeing you before he wan in bath but for a couple of days 
he came only to engage lodging for us 
a that never occurred to me 
and of course not seeing him anywhere i thought he must be gone 
was not the young lady he danced with on monday 3 mia 
smith 
7 a yes 
an acquaintance of mr hughes 
i dare lay the was very glad to dance 
do you think her pretty i 7 a not very 
he never come to the pump-room i suppose 2 a yet 
sometimes 
but he has rid out thin morning with my father go on e by northanger abbey 
mr hughes now joined them and make miss tilneyiflhewaereadytogo 
i hopelehallhave the place of seeing you again soon a laid catherine 
shall you he at the cotillion ball to-morrow 3” 1 perhaps we 
yes i think we certainly half a i am glad of it or we shall all be there 
civility was duly returned and they parted on miss tilney’s side with some knowledge of her nevucquninunce e feelings and on catherine’s without the smallest oonecioutneu of having explained them 
she went home very happy 
the morning had answered all her hopes and the evening of the following day was now the object of expectation 
the future good 
what gown and what head-dreehe ahould weoron the occasion became her chief concern 
she can not be united in it 
dress in at all times a drive 
long distinction and expensive solicitude about it often enjoy its own aim 
catherine knew all thin very well 
her great aunt had rather alectureon the subject only the christmas before 
and yet she lay awake ten minutes on wednesday night debating between her spotted and her tambour mullin 
and nothing but the ahnrtneu of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening 
thin would have been an error in judgment great though not uncommon from which one of the other year rather than her own a brother rather than i great aunt might have warned her 
for man only can be aware of the insensibility of man towards a new gown 
it would be mortifying to the feelings of many ladies could they be made to understand how little the heart of man ll affected by what is costly or new in their fire 
how little it ll misused by the mixture of their muslin and how unaueeeptihle of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted 
the argued the full or the jnclroner 
woman ll one for her own satisfaction alone 
no man will admire her the more no northanger abbey 
-5 woman will like her the better for it 
neatness and fashion are enough for the former and a something of dnabbinete or impropriety will be most endearing to the later 
but not one of these grave reﬂectiontroubled the tranquillity of catherine 
she entered the rooms on tuesday evening with feelingvery different from what had attended her thither the monday before 
she had then been exulting in her engagement to thorpe and was now chiefly anxious to avoid his night 
lest he should engage her again 
for though the could not dared not expect that mr tilney should all her i third time to dance her wishes hopes and plans all centered in nothing less 
every young lady may feel for my heroine in thin critical moment for every young lady has at some time or other known the name agitation 
all have been or at learn all have believed themselves to be in danger from the pursuit of some one whom they wished to avoid 
and all have been anxious for the attention of some one whom they wished to please 
as soon an they were joined by the the s catherine’s agony began 
the fidgeted about if on thorpe came toward her hid herself at much as possible from his view and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear him 
the cotillione were over the country-dancing beginning and the saw nothing of the tilney 
a do not be frightened my dear catherine a whisper isabella but i am really going to dance with your brother again 
i declare pouitively it in quite shocking 
i tell him he ought to he ashamed of himself but you and john must keep us in countenance 
make hate my dear creature and come to an 
john in just walked off but he will be back in a moment 
catherine had neither time nor inclination to answer 
the other 
walked away 
john to was mill in view and the gave herself up for in 
she might be northanger abbey 
not appear however to observe or expect him she kept her eyes intently fixed on her fan 
and a self-condemnation for her folly in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet with the tilney in any reasonable time had just ued through her mind when she suddenly found be addressed and again solicited to dance by mr t ilney himself 
with what sparkling eyes and ready motion she granted his request and with how pleasing a letter of heart she went with him to the set may be easily imagined 
to escape and as she believed so narrowl escape john thorpe and to be asked so immediate s on his joining her asked by mr tilney as if he had sought her on purpose l 
— it did not appear to her that life could supply any greater felicity 
scarcely had they worked themselves into the quiet possession of a place however when her attention was claimed by john thorpe who stood behind her 
heyday miss morland 
a said he what is the meaning of this 
i thought you and i were to dance together 
a 1 wonder you should think so for you never asked me 
“thatissgoodone by jove 
i sskedymassoou as i came into the room and i was just going so ask on again but when i turned round you were gone 
his is a curtsey shabby trick 
i only came or the sake of dancing with you and i firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since monday 
as 
i remember i asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak 
and here have i been telling all my acquaintance that i was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room 
and when they see you standing up with somebody else they will quiz me famous you a oh 
no 
they will never think of use after such s description as that 
rout-tans” 
abbey 
-5 “by heavens 
if they do not i will kick heart of the room for blackheads 
what chapel have you there 3 a catherine aatiaﬁed his curiosity 
a tilney 4 he repeated 
hum 
i do not know him 
a good figure of a man 
well put together 
does he want a horse 
here is a friend of mine sam fletcher us got one to sell that would suit anybody 
a famous clever animal or the road 
only forty guineaa 
i had ﬁfty minds to buy it myself for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when i meet with one 
but it would not answer my purpose it would not do for the old 
i would give any money for a real good hunter 
i have three now the best that ever were held 
i would not take eight hundred guinea for them 
fetch and i mean to get a house in leicestershire against the next season 
it 
is so d 
uncomfortable living at an in this was the last sentence by which he could weary catherine’s attention for he was just then born of by the naistlees pressure of a long string of passing ladies her partner now drew near and said that gentleman would have put me out of patience had he staid with you half minute longer 
he has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me 
we have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the place of an evening and all our agreeablenest belongs toler to each other for that time 
nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one without injuring the rights of the other 
i consider a country-dance as an tumbler of marriage 
civility and complainance are the principal duties of both 
and those men who do not chuse to dance or marry themselves 
have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours a but they are such very different things 
a that you think the can not be compared together 
a to be sure not 
people that marrycan neverpart 68 nona-hanger annrzv 
but must go and keep house together 
people that dance only stand opposite to each other in a long me for half an hour a and such is your decision of matrimony and dancing 
taken in that light certainly their resemblance is not striking 
but i think i could place them in such a view 
you will allow that in both man has the advantage of choice woman only the power of refusal 
that in both it is an engagement between man and woman formed for the advantage of each 
and that when once entered into they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution 
that it is their duty each to endeavour to give no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their new hour or fancying that they should have been better i with any one else 
you will allow this 
a yes to be sure as you rate it all this sounds very well 
but still they are so very different 
i can not look upon them at all in the same light nor think the same duties belong to them 
a in one respect there certainly is a difference 
in marriage the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman 
the woman to make the home agreeable to the man 
he is to pure and she is to smile 
but in dancing their duties are exactly changed 
the agreeableness the compliance are expected from him while she finished the an and the lavender water 
that i suppose was the difference of duties which struck on as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison 
a no indeed i never thought of that when i am quite at i loss 
one thing however i must observe 
this disposition on your side is rather alarming 
you totally swallow any similarity in the obligations 
and may i not thence infer that your northanger abbey 
69 notions of the duties of the dancing state are not w rtrict no your partner might wish have i not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return or if any other gentleman were to address you there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose 2 
a mr thorpe in such a very particular friend of my brother that if he talk to me i must talk to him again 
but there are hardly three young men in the room heddeo him that i have any acquaintance was a hand it that to being only security 
also 
alas 
nay i urn sure that you can not have a better 
for if i do not know anybody it it impossible for me to talktothem 
and besides i do not want to talk to anybody 
now you have given me a security worth having 
and i shall proceed with courage 
do you and bath a agreeable when i had the honour of making the inquiry 
before i 7 a as quite 
more so indeed more to 
take care or on will forget to be tired of it at the proper time 
on ought to be tired at the end of six weeks 1 i do not think i should be tired if i were to my here six months 1 bath compared with london halittle variety and to everybody and out every year 
for six weeks i allow both is pleasant enough 
but beyond that it in the most tiresome place in the world you would be told so by people of all description who come regularly every winter lengthen their nix week into ten or twelve and go away at last beam they can afford to any no longer 
well other people must judge for themselves and those who go to london may think nothing of bath 
but i who live in a small retired village in the country to northanger abbey 
can never end greater meanness in such a place as this than in my own home 
for here are a variety ofnmnsememe a variety of things to be seen and done all day long which i can know nothing of there 
you are not fond of the country 
a yes i am 
i have always lived there and always been very happy 
but certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a bath life 
one day in the country is exactly like another 
a but then you spent your time so much more rationally in the country a do i pay 
do you not a i do not believe there is much difference 
a here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long a and so i am at home only i do not ﬁndso much of it 
i walk about here and so i do there 
but here i see a variety of people in every street and there i can on go and call on mrs allen 
a fair tilney was very much amused 
a only go and call on mrs allen 
4 he repeated 
a what a picture of intellectual poverty 
however when you sink into this abyss again you will have more to say 
you will be able to talk of bath and of all that you did herself 
oh 
as 
i shall never be in want of something to talk 01’ again to mrs allen or anybody else 
i really believe i shall always be talking of bath when i am at home again 
i do like it so very much 
if i could but have papa and mamma and the rest of them here i in dose i should be too ha y 
james coming my best brother is quite delightful 
and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already 
oh 
who can ever be urged of bath 
7 a not those who bring such fresh feelings of every 9 northanger abbey 
1 
sort to it as you do 
but papa and mamma and brothers and intimate friends are a good deal gone by to most of the frequency of bath 
and the honest relish of balls and plays and everyday sighu is past with them here their conversation closed 
the demands of the dance becoming now too importunate for a divided attention 
soon after their reaching the bottom of the set catherine perceived herself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the 
lockers-on immediately behind her partner 
he was a very handsome man of a commanding aspect past the bloom but not pastthe vigour of life 
and with his eye still directed towards her she saw him presently address mr tilney in a familiar whisper 
confused by his notice and blushing from the fear of its being excited by something wrong in her appearance she turned away her head 
but while she did so the gentleman retreated and her anger coming nearer said i see that you guess what have just been asked 
that gentleman knows your name and you have a right to know his 
his general tilney my father catherine’s answer was only 
oh 
a but it was an 
oh it expressing everything needful 
attention to his words and perfect reliance on their truth 
with real interest and strong admiration‘did her eye now follow the general as he moved through the crowd and a how handsome a family they are 
a was her secret remark in cutting with miss tilney before the evening concluded a new source of felicity arose to her 
she had never taken a country walk since her arrival in bath 
miss tilney to whom all the commonly frequented environs were familiar spoke of them in terms which made her all eagerness to know them too 
and on her 42 northanger abbey 
openly fearing that she might and nobody to go with her it was proposed the brother and sister that they should join in a w k tome morning or other 
a i shall like it she cried beyond anything in the world 
and do not let us put it of let us go to-morrow a thin wan readily agreed to with only 10 of miss tilney’s that it did not rain which ca erine wn tune it would not 
at twelve o'clock they were to call for her in pulteney street and a remember twelve o'clock was her parting punch to her new friend 
of her other her older her more established friend isabella of whose delay and worth the had enjoyed a fortnight experience the names law anything during the evening 
yet though longing to make her acquainted with her ha pineu the cheerfully submitted to the wish of mr a less which took them rather early away and her spirits danced within her no she danced in her chair all the way home 
s cblpttt 3 
he now brought a very sober-looking morning 
the sun making only a few efforts to appear 
and catherine augured from it everything most favourable to her wishes 
a bright morning so early in the year the allowed would generally turn to rain 3 but a cloud one foretold improvement an the day advanced 
he a lie to mr allen for conversation of her hope but 1 allen not having his own skin and barometer about him declined giving any ahoolute promise of sunshine 
she applied to mrs allen and 41 allen’s opinion wan more tive 
a she had no doubt in the world of its being a very one day if the clouds would only go off and the turn in out at about eleven o'clock however a w speck 
of northanger abbey 
43 mall ruin upon the windows caught catherine’s watchful eye and a oh dear 
i do believe it will be wet broke from her in a most derponding woe 
a i thought how it would be a laid mrs allen 
a no walk for me to-day 1 sighed catherine 
a but she 
s it may come to nothing or it may hold up or twelve a perhaps it may 
but then my dear it will be so dirty.” 1 3h 
that will not signify 
i never mind dirt 
a of a liked her friend v said a i know on never mind-en.” cry up my yet after a short pause 1 it comes on faster and faster 
said catherine as the mode laughing at a window 
a so it does indeed 
if it keeps ruining the streets will be very set a there on four umbrellas up already 
how i hate the eight ofln umbrella 
a they are disagreeable things to carry 
i would much rather take a chair at any time a it was such a nice looking morning 
i felt so convinced it would be dry 
a any body would have thought so indeed 
there will be very few people in the pump-room if it rains all the morning 
i hope mr allen will put on his great coat when he goes but i dare say he will not for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a great coat 
i wonder he should dislike it it must be to comfortable 
the rain continued fast though not heavy 
bath 
erine went every live minute to the clock threatening on each return that if it still kept on remaining another five minutes the would give up the matter no hopeless 
the clock muck twelve and it will mind a you will not be able to go my dear 
i do not quite despair yet 
i shall not in it up i 
44 northanger abbey 
till a quarter aﬁer twelve 
this in just the time day for it to clear up and i do think it looks a little lighter 
there it it twenty minutes after twelve and now i 1601/ give it up entirely 
oh 
that we lad inch weather here as they had at udolpho or at lent in susan and the south of f more the night that poor st aubin died 
— 
such heantiﬁxl weather 
at half past twelve when catherine’s anxious attention to the weather was over and she could no longer claim an merit from its amendment the sky began volunta ay to clear 
a gleam of sunshine took her quite surprized 
she looked round the clouds were parting and she instantly returned to the window to watch over and encourage the happy appearance 
ten 
minutes more made it certain that a her hat afternoon would succeed and justify the opinion of mr allen who had always thought it would clear up 
but whether catherine might still expect her friends whether there had not been too much rain for miss tilney to venture must et be a question 
it was too dirty for us allen to accompany her husband to the pump-room he accordingl set off by himself and catherine had barely watch him down the meet when her notice was claimed by the approach of the same two open carriages containing the same three peo let that had surprized her to much a few mornings ck 
a isabella my brother and mr thorpe i declare 
they are coming for me perhaps 
but i shall not go 
i can not go indeed 
for you know miss tilney may still call mr allen agreed toil john thorpe was noon with them and his voice war with them yet sooner for on the stain he was calling out miss morlnndtohequiok 
make haste 
makehaatel” she threw open the door up on your hat this moment 
there is no time to he out 
we are going to bristol 
how cl'ye do mrs allen i northanger abbey 
45 to bring 
is not thatugreat way off 
but however i can not go with you to-day because i am engaged 
i expect some friends every moment that was ofcouree vehemently talked down as no reason it all my allen wan called on to second him and the two others walked in to give their assistance 
a my sweetest catherine in not this delightful 
we shall have a most heavenly drive 
you are to thank your brother and me or the regular it darted into our headn-at breakfast time i verily believe it the same intent 
and we should have been off two hour 
ago if it had not been for thin detettable rain 
but it does not signify the night moonlight and we shall do delightfully 
oh l i am in web estate at the thought of a little country air and quiet 
no much better than gain to the lower room we shall drive directly to clifton and dine there 
and an noon at dinner in over if there it time for it go on to kingrwuton.” 1 i doubt our being able to do to much a mind morland 
a you speaking fellow 
a cried thorpe a we shall be able to do ten times more 
kingsweaton 
aye and size cutle too and anything else we can hear of 
but here your sister says the will not go 
a blaze caltle 
a cried catherine 
a what it that 2” 6 the rest place in england 
worth going forty miles at any time to lee 
a what in it really a case an old cattle l a 6 the oldest in the kingdom 3 but in it like what one reads of 
a exactly the very lane a but now really are there powers and long galleriee 
a by dozen 
then i should like pace it 
but i can not 
cannot go.” 46 northanger abbey 
a not go 
my beloved creature what do you mean he a i can not go because looking down an she spoke fearful of isabella s smile a i expect miss tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk 
they promised to come at twelve only it rained 
but now as it is so fine i dare say they will be here soon 
a not they indeed cried thorpe 
a for no we turned into broad street i saw them 
does he not drive a prison with bright chestnuts or a i do not know indeed yes i know he does 
i saw him 
you are talking of the man you danced with last night are not you 
7 a year a well i saw him at that moment turn up the london road driving a smart-looking girls a did you indeed 
7 a did upon my soul 
knew him again directly 
and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle soon a it is very odd 
but i suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk and well they might for i never saw so much dirt in my life 
walk 
you could no more walk than you could by 
it has not been to dirty the whole winter 
it in mud deep everywhere.” isabella corroborated it 
a my dearest catherine you can not form an idea of the dirt 
come you must go 
you can not refuse going now a should like to see the case 
but may we go all over it 
may we go up every source and into every spite of room 2 yes yes 
every hole and corner 
a but then if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is drive and call by and by 
7 a make yourself easy there in no danger of that 
noxrnrmcnn assay 
-5 for i heard tilney hallooing to a man who was just ‘ng by on horseback that they were going as far as ick rocks.” then i will 
shall i go mrs allen 
a just as you please my dear a mrs allen you must persuade her to go was the general cry 
mr allen was not inattentive to it 
a well my dear said she a suppose you go 
and in two minutes they were of 
catherine’s feelings as she got into the carriage were in a very unsettled state divided between regret for the loss of one great pleasure and the hope of soon enjoying another almost its equal in degree however unlike in kind 
she could not drink the tilney had acted quite well by her in so readily giving up their engagement without sending her any message of excuse 
it was now but an hour later than the time fixed on for the beginning of their walk 
and in spite of what she had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the course of that hour she could not from her own observation help drinking that they might have gone with verylittle inconvenience 
to feel herself slighted by them was very painful 
on the other hand the delight of exploring any advice like udolpho as her fancy represented b aize taste to be was such a counterpoise of good as might console her for almost any thing 
they passed briskly down pulteney street and 
through laura place without the exchange of many words 
thorpe talked to his horse and she meditated by turns on broken promises and broken arches phaeton and false hangin s tilney and trap-doors 
as they entered argyle uildings however she was roused by this address from her companion who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by 2 7 a who 2 where 
a 5 on the right-hand pavement she must be almost 48 newsman anon 
out of right now.” catherine looked round and iv mine tilney leaning on her brother's am walking slowly down the street 
she saw them both looking back at her 
a stop stop mr thorpe 6 the impatiently cried it ll mien ilney 
it it indeed 
how could you tell me they were gone 
stop 
up i will get out thin moment and go to them 
but to what purpose did the peak 
thorpe only asked his home into a brick trot 
the tilney who had soon ceased to look after her were in a moment out of light round the corner of laura place and in another moment the way here whisked into the market place 
still however and during the length of another street the stated him to 
up 1 etc mr to i can not our 
will not go 
ii 
i miss go rckrﬁllﬁu tillie 
g but mr thorpe only laughed marked his whip encouraged his home made odd voices and drove on 
and catherine angry and vexed an the wan having no power of getting away was obliged to give up the point and habit 
her reproach however were not spare 
how could you deceive me so mr thorpe 
how could you i that you saw them driving up the london road i would not have had it happen so for the world 
they must think it to manage no rude of me to go by them too without saying a word 
you do not know how vexed i am 
i shall have no pleasure at clifton nor in anything else 
i had rather ten thousand times rather get out now and walk back to them 
how could you say you saw them driving out in a prison 
thorpe defended himself very stoutly declared he had never seen two men so much alike in his life and would hardly give up the point of in having been tilney hinuelf 
their drive even when this subject was over was not likely to be very agreeable 
catherine complaieance was no longer what it had been in their former northanger abbey 
43 airing 
she listened reluctantly and her replies were short 
blame castle remained her only comfort 
towards that she still looked at intervals with pleasure 
though rather than be disappointed of the promised walk and especially rather than be thought ill of the tilney she would willingly have given up i the happiness which its walls could supply the happiness of a progress through a long spite of lucy rooms exhibiting the remains of magniﬁcent figure though now for many years deserted the happiness of being stopped in their way along narrow winding vaults by a 
low grated door 
or even of having their lamp their only lamp 
extinguished by a sudden gust of wind and of being left in total darkness 
in the meanwhile they proceeded on their journey without any mischanoe and were within view of the town of keynsharn when a ballroom from morland who was behind them made his friend pull up to know what was the matter 
the others then came close enough for conversation 
and morland said a we had better go back thorpe 
it is too late to go on to-day 
your sister thinks so as well as i 
we have been exactly an hour coming from pulteney street very little more than seven miles 
and i suppose we have at least eight more to go 
it will never do 
we set out s gm deal too late 
we had much better put it or till another day and turn round 
a it is all one to me replied thorpe rather angrily 
and instantly turning his horse they were on their way back to bath 
if your brother had not got such a d 
breast to drive a said he soon afterwards a we might have done it very well 
my horse would have trusted to clifton within the hour if left to himself and i have aim broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed brokenwinded jade’s pace 
norland is s fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own so northanger abbey 
a no he is not a said catherine warmly 
for 
am sure he could not afford it 
a and why can not be afford it 
7 a because he has not money enough 1 and whose fault is that 
7 a nobody that i know of 
thorpe then said something in the loud incoherent way to which he had often recourse about its being a d 
— 
thing to be miserable 
and that if people who enrolled in money could not a word things he did not know who could which catherine did not even endeavour to understand 
dian appointed of what was to have been the consolation for her first disappointment she was less and less disposed either to be agreeable herself or to and her companion so 
and they returned to pulteney street without her speaking twenty words 
as she entered the house the 
footman told her that a gentleman and lady had called and inquired for her a few minutes after her setting off 
that when he told them she was gone out with mr thorpe the lady had asked whether any message had been left for her and on his saying no 
had felt for a card but said she had none about her and went away 
pondering over these heart-reading tidings catherine walked slowly upstairs 
at the head of them she was met by mr allen who on hearing the reason of their speedy return said i am glad your brother had so much sense 
i am glad you are come back 
it was a strange wild scheme they all spent the evening together at thorpe’s 
catherine was disturbed and out of spirits 
but isabella seemed to and a pool of commerce in the fate of which she shared by private partnership with morland i very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at clifton 
her satisfaction too in not being at the lower rooms was spoken more than once 
a how northanger abbey 
8 i pity the poor creatures that are going there 
how glad i am that i am not among them 
i wonder whether it will be a full ball or not 
they have not begun dancing yet 
i would not be there for all the world 
it is so delightful to have an evening now and then to one self 
i dare say it will not be a very good hall 
i know the mitchell will not be there 
am sure i pity everybody that is 
but i dare say mr morland you long to be at it do not you 
i am sure you do 
well pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you 
i dare say we could do very well without you but you men think yourselves of such consequence catherine could almost have accused isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her ioitovii is very little did they appear to dwell on her mind and so very inadequate was the comfort she offered 
a do not he so dull my dearest creature she whispered 
a you will quite break my heart 
it was amazingly shocking to he sure but the ’i‘ilneyu were entirely to blame 
why were not they more punctual 
it was dirty indeed but what did that signify 
i am sure john and i should have not minded in i never mind going through anything where a friend it concerned 
that in my disposition and 
john in the name 
he has amazing strong feeling 
good heavens 
what a delightful hand you have got 
kings i vow 
i never was so happy in my life i would ﬁfty time 
rather you should hue them than myself and now i may dismiss my heroine to the sky less coach which it the true heroine’s portion

chapter 33 
a smaller 1 said catherine the next morning 1 will there be any harm in my calling on its tilney to-day 
i shall not be easy 3 i have explained everything a go b all means my dear 
only put on a white gown 
miss tiln always wears white.” catherine chee ly complied 
and being properly equipped was more in atient than ever to be at the pump-room that she might inform herself of general tilney’s lodgings 
for though she believed they were in milsom street she was not certain of the house and mrs allen’s wavering convictions only made it more doubtful 
to milsom street she was directed 
and having made herself perfect in the number hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit explain her conduct and be forgiven tripping lightly through the churchyard and resolutely turning away her eyes that she might not be obliged to see he 
beloved isabella and her dear family who she ha reason to believe were in a shop hard by 
she reached the home without any impediment looked at the number knocked at the door and inquired for miss tilney 
the man believed miss tilney to be at home but was not quite certain 
would she be pleased to send up her name 
she gave her card 
in a few minutes the servant returned and with a look which did not quite confirm his words said he had been mistaken for that miss tilney had walked out 
catherine with a blush of mortification left the house 
she felt almost persuaded that miss tilney war at home and too much offended to admit her 
and as she retired down the street could not withhold one glance at the drawing-room windows in expectation of seeing northanger abbey 
83 her there but no one appeared at them 
at the bottom of the street however she looked back again and then not at a window but issuing from the door she as miss tilney herself 
she was followed by gentleman whom catherine believed to be her father and they turned up towards edward s buildings 
catherine in deep moniﬁcation proceeded on her way 
she could most be angry herself at such angry ineivility 
but she checked the resentful sensation she remembered her own ignolance 
she knew not how such an offence as hers might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness to what a degree of unforgiveness it might with propriety lad nor to what hours of rudeness in return it might justly make her amiable 
dejected and humbled she had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theatre that night 
but it must be confessed that they were not of in continuance 
for she soon collected in the first put act that she was without any excuse for staying at home 
and in the second that it was a play the wanted very much to see 
to the theatre accordingly they all went 
no tilney appeared to plague or please her 
she feared that amongst the many perfections of the family a fondness for plays was not to be ranked but perhaps it was because they were hesitated to the anger rforrnances of the london age which she knew on aabella’s authority rendered everything else of the kind 
quite horrid.” she was not deceived in her own expectation of pleasure the comedy so well suspended her care that no one observing her during the first four acts would have supposed she had any wretchedan about her 
on the beginning of the fifth however the sudden view of mr henry tilney and his father joining a party in the opposite box recalled her to anxiety and distress 
the stage could no longer excite genuine meri-iment1 no longer keep her whole attention 
every other look upon an voyage was 84 “common sonny 
directed towards the of polite box 
and for the space of two entire scenes did she thus watch hen tilney without being once able to catch his eye 
i longer could he he s of indifference for a play 
his notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes 
at length however he did look towards her and he bowed but such a bow 
no smile no continued observance attended it his eyes were immediately returned to their former direction 
catherine was restlessly miserable 
she could almost have run round to the box in which he sat and forced him to hear her explanation 
feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her 
instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation 
instead of mudly resolving in conscious innocence to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation and to enlightened him on the post only by avoiding his sight or flirting with somebody else she took to herself all the shame of misconduct or at least of its appearance and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause 
the play concluded the curtain fell 
henry tilney was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto eat but his father remained and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box 
she was right in a few minutes he appeared and making his way through the then turning rows spoke with like calm politeness to mrs allen and her friend 
not with such calmness was he answered by the latter 
a oh mr tilney i have been united wild to speak to you and make my apologies 
or must have thought me so rude 
but indeed it was not my own fault 
was it mrs allen 2 did not they tell me that mr tilney and his sister were gone out in s barton together 
and then what could i do 
but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you 
now had not i mrs allen 3 a flat a no i northanger new 
-5 a my dear you ramble my gown a was mrs allen 
133. 
her assurance however standing sole as it did was not thrown away 
it brought a more cordial more natural smile into his countenance and he replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve a we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in style street 
on were so kind as to look back on purpose 
a but indeed i did not wish you a pet pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing 
but i begged mr thorpe so earnestly to stop 
i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you 
now mrs allen did not oh 
you were not there 
but indeed i did 
and if mr thorpe would only have stopped i would have jumped out and run after you is there a henry in the world who could be insensible to such adeclaration 
henry tilney at least was not 
with a yet sweeter smile he said everything that need be said of his sisters concern regret and dependence on catherine’s honour 
oh do not say miss tilney was not angry a cried catherine because i know she was 
for she would not see me this morning when i called 
i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it 
i was hurt but i was not aﬂ'ronted 
perhaps you did not know i had been here i was not within at the time but i heard of it from eleanor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to england the reason of such civility 
but perhaps i can i it as well 
it was nothing more than that my father 
they were just preparing to walk out and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put all made a point of her being denied 
that was all i do assure you 
she was very much vexed and meant so make her apology as soon as possible 
so northanger abbey 
catherine s mind was greatly asked by thin information yet a something of solicitude remained from which sprang the following question thoroughly ardent in itself though rather distressing to the gentleman 3 but mr tilney why were you less general than your litter 
if the felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be only a mistake why ehould‘jou he to ready to take oﬁence 
7 a me 
i take oﬂ'ence 
7 a nay i am sure by your look when you came into the box you were angry a i an i i could have no right 
a was nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face he replied by taking her to make room for him and talking of the play 
he remained with them some time and wan only too agreeable for catherine to be contented when he went away 
before they parted however it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken at man at possible 
and setting aside the misery of his quitting their box the was upon the whole left one of the happiest creatures in the world 
while talking to each other the had observed with some surprise that john thorpe who wan never in the same part of the house for ten minutes together was engaged in conversation with general tilney 
and the felt something more than surprize when she thought 
she could perceive herself the object of their attention and ditcour‘se 
what could they have to may of her 
she feared general tilney did not like her appearance 
she found it was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter rather than postpone his own walk a few minutes 
a how came mr thorpe to know your father 
a wan her anxious inquiry at the ointed them out to her companion 
he knew nothing about it 
northanger abbey 
37 but his father like every military man had a very large as ummance 
hen the entertainment was over thorpe came to first them in getting out 
catherine wan the immediate object of his gallantry 
and while they waited in the lobby for a chair he prevented the inquiry which had travelled from her heart almost to the top of her tongue by taking in a comequemial manner whether the had seen him talking with general tilney 
4 he is a fine old fellow upon my soul 
stout active 
look as young at still in 
i have a great regard for him i 380m you 
a gentleman-like good sort of fellow at ever lived a but how came on to know him 2 7 a know him 
here are few people much about lawn that i do not know 
i have met him for ever at the bedford 
and i knew his face again to-day the moment he came into the billiard-room 
one of the best players we have both 
bye 
and we had a little touch together though i was almost afraid of him at lint 
the nods were live to four against me 
and if i had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever wan made in this world 
i took his ball exactly 
but i could not make you understand it without a table however i it 
beat him 
a very one fellow 
at rich as a few 
i should like to dine with him 
i darcy he give famoua dinners 
but what do you think we have been talking of 3 you 
yes by heaven 
and the general think you the rest girl in both a oh nonnenle 
how can you nay to e 7 a and what do you think i laid 
a lowering llll voice 
well done general a laid ii 8 i am quite of or mind a ere catherine who was much let gratified by hiadmiration than bﬁgeueral tilney was not sorry to be called away by 1 allen 
thorpe however would are her to her chair and till the entered it continued 88 won-rumour assay 
the same kind of delicate matter in spite of her entreating him to have done 
that general tilney instead of disliking should admire her was very delightful 
and she joyfully thought that there was not one of the family whom she need now fear to meet 
the evening had done more 
much more for her than could have been expected chapter 33 
only tuesday wednesday thursday friday and saturday have now passed in review before the reader 
the events of each day its hopes and fears mortiﬁcstions and pleasures have been separately stated and the pangs of sunday only now remain to be described and close the week 
the clifton scheme had been deferred not relinquished 
and on the aﬁemoon’s crescent of this day it was brought forward again 
in a private consultation between isabella and james the former of whom had particularly set her heart upon going and the latter no less anxious placed his upon pleasing her it was agreed that avoided the weather were fair the party should take place on the following morning 
and they were to set off very early in order to be at home in good time 
the affair thus determined and hopes approbation secured catherine only remained to be surprized of it 
she had left them for a few minutes to speak to miss tilney 
in that interval the plan was completed and as soon as she came again her agreement was demanded 
but instead of the gay acquiescence expected by isabella catherine looked grave was very sorry but could not go 
the engagement which ought to have kept her from joining in the former attempt would make it imnoumsnonn abbey 
8 possible for her to accompany them now 
she had that moment settled with miss tilney to take their promised walk to-rnorrow 
it was quite determined and she would not upon any account retract 
but that she mr and could retract wan instantly the eager cry of both the thorpe 
they must go to clifton to-morrow they would not go without her it would be nothing to put of a mere walk for one day longer and they would not hear of a refusal 
catherine was distressed but not subdued 
a do not urge me isabella 
i am engaged to miss tilney 
i can not go this availed nothing 
the same arguments assailed her again 
she must go she should go and they would not hear of a refusal 
it wouldbeaoeasytotell mile tilneythatyouhad just been reminded of a prior engagemengand must only beg to put on 
the walk till tuesday no it would not be easy 
i could not do it 
there has been no prior engagement but isabella became only more and more urgent 
calling on her in the most affectionate manner 
addressing her by the most endearing names 
she was sure her dearest sweetest catherine would not seriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so dearly 
she knew her beloved catherine to have no feeling a heart sweet a temper to he so easilypersuaded b those she loved 
but all in vain 
catherine felt hene f to be in the right and though pained by such tender such ﬂattering mpplieation could not allow it to influence her 
isabella then tried another method 
she reached her with having more affection for miss illness though the had known her so little i while than for her best and oldest friends 
with being grown cold and indifferent in short towards herself 
a i cannoti help being jealous catherine when i see myself bled for strange 
i who love you so excessively 
hen once my affection are placed it in not in the g 30 northanger abbey 
power of anything to change them 
but i believe my feelings are stronger than any body s 
i am sure they uremo strong for my own peace 
and to see myself supplanted in your friendship'llsy strangers does cut me other quick 0 
these ilneys seem to swallow up everything else catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind 
was it the part of a friend thus to expose her feelings to the notice of others 
isabella appeared to her ungenerous and selfish regardless of everything but her own gratification 
these painful ideas crossed her mind though she said nothing 
isabella in the meanwhile had applied her handkerchief to her eyes 
and morland miserable at such a sight could not help saying “nay catherine i think you can not stand out any longer now 
the sacrifice is not much 
and to oblige such a friend i shall think you quite unkind if you still refuse 
this was the first time of her brother s openly siding against her 
and anxious to avoid his displeasure she proposed a compromise 
if they would only out of their scheme till tuesday which they might yet do as it depended only on themselves she could go with them and everybody might then be satisfied 
but a no no no i a was the immediate answer 
that could not be for the did not know that he might not go to town on t y 
catherine was sorry but could do no more 
and a short silence ensued 
which was broken by isabella who in a voice of cold resentment 
said very well then there is an end of the party 
if catherine does not go i can not 
i can not be the chief woman 
i would not upon any account in the world do so improper a thing a catherine you must go a said james 
a but what can not mr thorpe drive one of his other sisters 
i 11 say either of them would like to go 
northangir abbey 
9 
a thank e 7 cried thorpe 
but i did not come to bath to ve my sisters about and look like i fool 
no if you do not go d 
me if i do 
i only go for the sake of driving you a that is a compliment which give no pleasure but her words were lost on thorpe who had turned abruptly away 
6 the three others still continued together walking in a most uncomfortable manner to poor catherine 
sometimes not a word was said sometimes she was again attacked with supplications or reproaches and her arm was still linked within isabella’s though their hearts were at war 
at one moment she was softened at other irritated 
always distressed but always steady 
i did not think you had been so obstinate catherine 1 said james 
you were not used to be so hard to persuade 
you once were the kindest best-tempered of m sisters 
hope i an not less so now a she replied very feelingly 
but indeed i can not go 
if i am wrong i am doing what i believe to be right 
i suspect a mind isabella in a low voice a there is no real struggle.” gather-he’s heart swelled 
she drew away heart and isabella made no opposition 
thus lasted a long ten minutes till they were again joined by ho who coming to them with s gayer look said a we i have settled the matter and now we may all go to-morrow with a safe conscience 
i have been to miss tilney and made your excuse you have not 
a cried catherine 
a i have upon my soul 
left her this moment 
told her you had sent me to say that having just recollected a prior engagement of going to clifton with us so-morrowélyou could not have the pleasure of walking with her tuesday 
she said very well tuesday 32 horn[ anger “rey 
wasjustss convenient to her 
so there is an end of all our difficulties 
a pretty good thought of mine has 2 isabella s countenance was once more all smiles and good-humour and james too looked ha y again 
a most heavenly thought indeed 
now my sweet catherine all our distresseare over 
you are honour 
my acquitted and we shall have a most delightful this will not do said catherine 
a i can not submit to this 
i must run after mine tilney directly and set her right isabella however caught hold of one hand thorpe of the other 
and remonstnnces poured in from all three 
even james was quite angry 
when everything was settled when miss tilney herself said that tuesday would suit her as well it was quite ridiculous quite absurd to make an further objection 
i do not care 
1 thorpe had no business to invent an such message 
if i had thou but it right to at it or i could have spoken to miss lgilney myself 
his is on doing it in a reader way 
and how do i know that s thorpe has 
he may be mistaken again perhaps 
he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on friday 
let me go mr thorpe 
isabella do not hold me thorpe told her it would be in vain to go after the tilney they were turning the corner into brock street when he had overtaken them and were at home by this time 
a then i will go after them said catherine 
wherever they are i will go after them 
it does not signify talking 
if i could not be persuaded into doing what thought wrong i never was be tricked into it 
and with these words she broke awe and hurried off 
thorpe would have darted after her at morland with northanger abbey 
33 held him 
let her go let her go she will go 
she is as obstinate as 
a thorpe i never finished the smile for it could hardly have been a proper one 
away walked catherine in great agitation as fast as the crowd would permit her fearful of being pursued yet determined to persevere 
as she walked she reflected on what had passed 
it was painful to her to disappoint and displease them particularly to please her brother 
but she could not repent her resistance 
setting her own inclination apart to have failed a second time in her engagement to miss tilney to have resented a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before and on a false pretence too must have been wrong 
she had not been withstanding them on selﬁsh principles alone she had not consulted merely her own gratification 
him might have been ensured in some degree by the excursion itself by seeing blaize castle 
no she had attended to what was due to others and to her own character in their opinion 
her conviction of being right however was not cut i to restore her composure till she had spoken to so tilney she could not be at ease 
and quickening her pace when she got clear of the crescent 
she almost ran over the remaining ground till she gained the top of milsom street 
so rapid had been her movements that in spite of the tilney’s advantage in the outside they were but just turning into their lodgings as she came within view of them 
and the servant still remaining at the open door she used only the ceremony saying that she must speak with miss tilney that moment and hurrying by him proceeded up stairs 
then opening the first door red her which ha end to be the right she immediately found he in the drawing-room with general tilney his son and daughter 
a her explanation 
defective only in being 
from her 44 northanger abbey 
irritation of nerves sud shortness of breath 
no explanation at all was instantly given 
i am come in a great hurry 
it was all i mistake 
i never promised toga 
i wldthemfrom the first i could not go 
i ran away in a great hurry to explain it 
i did not care what you thought of me 
i would not stay for the servant 
the business however though not perfectly elucidated by this speech soon ceased to he a puzzle 
catheﬁnetfound that john thorpe bad given the message 
and miss tilney had no scruples in owning herself greatly surprized by it 
but whether her brother had still exceeded her in resentment catherine though she inductively addressed herself as much to one as to the other in her vindication had no means of knowing 
whatever might have been felt before her arrival her eager declarations immediately made every look and sentence as friendly as she could desire 
the affair thus happily settled she was introduced l1 miss tilney to her father and received by him wi such ready such solicizous politeness as recalled thorpe’s information to her mind and made her think with pleasure that he might he sometimes depended on 
to such anxious attention was the general’s civility carried that not aware of her extraordinary softness in entering the house he was quite angry with the servant whose neglect had reduced her to of the door of the a moment herself 
what did illiam mean by it 
e should make a point of inquiring into the matter and if catherine had not most warmly asserted his innocence it seemed likely that william would lose the favour of his master for ever if not his place by her rapidity 
sitting withthems usrterofsnhour she northanger abbey 
33 prized by general tilney’s asking her if she would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest the day with her 
miss tilney added her own wishes 
catherine was greatly obliged 
but it wan quite out of her power mr and mrs allen would expect her back every moment 
the general declared he could say no more 
the claims of mr and mrs allen were not to be superseded 
but on some other day he trusted when longer notice could be given they would not refuse to me her to her friend a oh no 
catherine was sure they would not have the least objection and she should have great pleasure in coming 
the general attended her himself to the street door saying everything gallant as they went down stairs admiring the elasticity of her walk which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her dancing and making her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld when they parted 
catherine delighted by all that had passed proceeded gain to pulteney street walking as she concluded with great elasticrty though she had never thought of it before 
she reached home without seeing anything more of the offended party 
and now that she had been triumphant throughout had carried her point and was secure of her walk she began as the latter of her spirits subsided to doubt whether she had been perfectly right 
a sacrifice was always noble 
and if she had given way to their entreaties she should have been spared the distressing idea of friend a brother angry and a scheme of great ha ideas to both destroyed perhaps through her means 
of ease her mind and ascertain by the of union of an unprejndiced person what her own conduct d really been she took occasion to mention before mr allen the half-settled scheme of her brother and the thorpe for the following day 
mr allen caught at it directly 
well a said he and doyouthinkofgoingmo 
go nonmnuonn ennnv 
no 
i had just engaged myoelfto walk with miss tilney before they told me of it 
and therefore you know i could not go with them could i pay a no certainly not 
and i am glad you do not think of it 
these schemes are not at all the thing 
young men and women driving about the country in open carriages 
now and then it in very well 
but going to in and public places together 
it is not right 
and i wonder my horse would allow it 
i am glad you do not think of going 
i am sure mr morland would not be pleased 
mrs allen are not you of my way of thinking 
do not you think there kind of projects objectionable 
a yes very much so indeed 
open carriages are nuty things 
a clean gown is not five minutes wear in them 
you are placed getting in and getting out 
and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction 
i hate an open carriage myself i know you do 
but that not the question 
do not on think it has an odd appearance if young ladies are hequently driven about in them by young men to whom they are not even related 
a yes my dear a very odd appearance indeed 
i not bear to see it 
dear madam 1 cried catherine then why did not you tell me so before 
i am sure if i had known it to be in proper i would not have gone with mr thorpe at l 
but i always hoped you would tell me if you thought i warn doing wrong 1 and so i should my dear you may depend on it 
for as i told mrs morland at parting i would always do the heat for you in my power 
but one must not be over particular 
young pen he will be young people as your good mother aye heme f. you know wanted you when we in came not to buy that qnigged muelin 
but you would 
young people do not like to be always thwarted.” horn[ anger abbey 
44 3 but this was something of real consequence 
and is notthinkyou wouldhavefonnd me hard unpermade.” as far as it has gone hitherto there is no harm done said mr allen 
a and i would only advise you my dear not to go out with mr thorpe any more that is just what i was going to by a added his wife 
catherine relieved for herself felt uneasy for isabella 
and after a moment s thought asked mr allen whether it would not be both proper and kind in her to write to miss thorpe and explain the indecorum of which she must be as insensible as herself 
for she considered that isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to clifton the next day in spite of what had passed 
mr allen however discouraged her from doing any such thing 
a you had better leave her alone my dear she is old enough to know what she is about and if not has a mother to advise her 
mrs thorpe is too indulgent beyond s doubt 
but however you had better not interfere 
she and your brother chose to go and you will be only getting ill-will.” 
catherine submitted 
and though sorry to think that isabella should be doing wrong felt greatly relieved by mr allen’s approbation of her own conduct and truly rejoiced to be preserved by his advice from the danger of falling into such an error herself 
her escape from being one of henry to clifton was now an escape indeed 
for what would the tilney have thought of her if she had broken her promise to them in order to do what was wrong in itself if she had been guilty of one breach of propriety only to enable her to be guilty of another

33 member wishing it in two days my hair standing on end the whole time a as a added miss tilney 
and i remember that a undertook to read it aloud to me 
and that when was called away for only five minutes to answer a note instead of waiting for me you took the volume into the hermitage walk and i was obliged to stay an you had finished it 
thank you eleanor 
a most honourable bestimony 
you see miss morland the injustice of your suspicions 
here was i in my senses to get on meaning to wait only five minutes for my sister 
making the promise i had made of reading it aloud and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part by running away with the volume which you are to observe was her own particularly her own 
i am proud when i reflect on it and i think it must establish me in your good opinion a i very glad to hear it indeed 
and now i shall never be ashamed of liking udolpho myself 
but i really thought before young men despised novels amazingly 
a it is amazingly it may well nugget past if they do for they read nearly as many as women 
i must have read hundreds and hundreds 
do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of julia and cousins 
if we proceed to particulars and engage in the never-ceasing inquiry of a ve you read this 
and‘haveyon read that i shallsoon leave you as far behind me as 
what shall i say 
i want an a private simile 
as far as your friend emily herself poor valancoun when she went with her aunt into italy 
consider how many years i have had the motion 
had altered onmymdientoxford whileyotlsylerengoodlittlegirl working yoursnmpler a home 
a look norwgeb abbey 
not very i am afraid 
but now really do not you think dolpho the nicest book in the we d i 
6 the nicest 
by which i suppose you mean the greatest 
that must depend upon the finding a hen 1 said miss tilney a you are very impertinent 
miss morland he is treating you exactly as he does his sister 
he is for ever ﬁnding fault with me for some correctness of an go and now he in taking the same liberty with you 
he word a nicest a as you used it did not suit him 
and you had better change it as soon as you can or we shall be overpowered with johnson and blair all the rest of the way 
7 a i am sure a cried catherine 1 i did not mean to say an in whom 
but anicebook nndwh shlmldyilntl call it so 2 
yes a very true a said henry and this is a very nice day 
and we are taking a very nice walk 
and you are two very nice young ladies 
oh 
it is a very nice word indeed 
it does for everything 
originally per 
ha a it was a lie only to express neatnese propriety de icacy or me nement 
people were nice in their dress in their sentiments or their choice 
but now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word a while in fact 
cried his sister a it ought only to he applied to you without any commendation at all 
you are more nice than wise 
come miss morland let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction while we praise udolpho in whatever terms we like best 
it is a most interesting work 
you are fond of that kind of reading 
7 a to say the truth i do not much like any other a indeed l a 
a that is i can read try and plans s and things of that sort and do not i like travels 
put history real eolemn history i can not be interested in 
can you 
a nortean ger abbey 
10 
a yes i am fond of history i wish i were too 
i read it a little as acutely 
but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me 
the quarrels of hopes and kings with was or pestilences in every page 
the men all so good for nothing and hardlfyzzny women at all it is very tiresome 
and yet i i think it odd that it should be so dull for a great deal of it must be invention 
the best that are put into the horses mouths their thoughts and designs the chief of all this must he invention and invention is what delights me in other looks a historians you think a said miss tilney a are not happy their rights of fancy 
they display imagination without raising interest 
i am fond of history and am very well contented to take the false with the true 
in the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and regards which may be as much depended on i conclude as anything that does not actually pass under one own observation 
and as for the little embellishment you speak of they are embellishments and i like them as such 
if a speech be well drawn up i read it with pleasure by whomsoever it may be made and probablyiwith much greater if the production of mr home or s robertson than if the spine words of csractacus agricola or altered the rear 
a you are fond of history 
and so are mr allen and my father 
and i have two brothers who do not dislike it 
so man instances within my small circle of friends is remarkably at this rate i shall not pity the writer of history any longer 
if people like to read theirbooks itis allverywell 
but to be at so much trouble in calling great volumes which as i used to think nobody would willingly ever look into to he labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls to 
northanger abbey 
away a much meunhnrdfate 
and both know it in very right and necessary i have often wondered at the person courage that could sit down on purpose to do it that little boy and girl should be tormented said henry is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilised state can deny 
but in behalf of our most distinguished historians i must observe that they might well be offended at being an and mr 
have no higher aim 
and that by their to at and less they are ctly well qualified to torment readers of the most a vanced reason and mature time of life 
i used the very a to torment 1 an i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct 1 supposing them not be now admitted an synonimoue.” 
you think me foolish to call instruction 2 torment 
but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then assuming to spell if you had ever seen how stupid they car 
be for a whole morning together and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it an i am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home you would allow that to torment and to inflict 
might sometime be used an cynonimoue words.” 
very probably 
but histories are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read 
and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very mere very intently application ma perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very we worth while to be tormented for two or three year of one life for the lake of being able to read all the nest of it 
consider if reading had not been taught mrs radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all 
catherine muted 
and a very warm panegyric from her on that lady merite cloud the subject 
the i 7 r t northanger abbey 
19 tilney were soon engaged in another on which the had nothing to say 
they were viewing the country with the eyes of persons accustomed to drawing 
and decided on its capability of being formed into pictures with all the eagerness of real taste 
here catherine was quite lost 
she knew nothing nfdrawing 
nothing of taste 
and she listened to them with an attention which brought her little pratt for they talked in phrases which conveyed scarcely any idea to her 
the little which she could understand however appeared to contradict the very few notions she had entertained on the matter before 
it seemed as if a good view were no longer to be taken from the top of on high hill and that a clear blue sky was no loss or a proof of a one day 
she was he s ashamed of her ignorance 
a misplaced shame 
where people wish to attach they should always be ignorant 
to come with a well-informed mind is to come with an inability of administering to the vanity of others which a sensible person would always wish to avoid 
a woman especially if she have the misfortune of knowing any thing should conceal it as well as she can 
the advantages of natural folly in a beautiful girl have been already set forth by the capital pen of a sister author 
and to her treatment of the subject i will only add injustice to men that though to the larger and more trifling part of the sex imbecility in females is a great engagement of their personal charms there is a portion of them too reasonable and no well-informed themselves to desire anything more in woman than ignorance 
but catherine did not know her own advantages 
did not know that a good-looking rl with an affectionate heart and a very ignorant mind can not fail of attracting a clever young man unless circumstances are particularly untoward 
in the present instance the confessed and lamented her want of knowing northanger abbey 
ledge 
declared that she would give anything in the world to be able to draw 
and a lecture on the picturesque immediately followed in which his instructions were so clear that she soon to see beauty in everything admired by him 
and her actions was so earnest that he became perfectly satisfied of her having a great deal of natural taste 
live talked of fore-grounds dances and second distances 
side-screens and perfect tives 
lights and shades 
and catherine was so hopeful a scholar that when they gained the top of beechen claim she voluntarily rejected the whole city of bath as unworthy to make part of a landscape 
delighted with her progress and fearful of marrying her with too much wisdom at once henry suffered the subject to decline and by an easy transition from a piece of 
lucky frames and the withered oak which he had placed near it summit 
to oaks in general 
to foresee the enclosure of them waste lands crown lands and government 
he shortly found himself arrived at litics 
and from limits it was an step to since 
the general pause which succeeded his short dilquiliﬁon on the state of the nation was put an end to by catherine who in rather a solemn tone of voice uttered these words a i have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in london miss tilney to whom this was chiefly addressed was startled and hastily 
indeed 
and of what nature 
a that i do not know nor who is the author 
i have only heard that it is to he more horrible than nothing we have met with yet a good heaven 
where could you bar of arch a thin 
a heap particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter london yesterday 
it is to be uncommonly dreadful 
i shall expect murder and'everything of the kind 14 
northanger abbey 
105 3 you with astonishing composure 
but i hope your end’s accounts have been exaggerated 
and if such a design is known beforehand proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to expect 
“government 1 said henry endeavouring not to smile a neither desires not dares to interfere in such matters 
there must be master and government cares not how much the ladies stared 
he laughed and added a come shall i make you understand each other or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can 
no i will be noble 
i will prove myself a man no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head 
i have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours 
perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen 
perhaps they may want observation discernment judgment 
are genius and wit 
miss morland do not mind what he says 
but have the goodness to satisfy me as no thisdresdful riot.” 1 riot 
— what riot 
7 a my dear eleanor the riot is only in your own brain 
the confusion there is scandalous 
miss morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out in three duodecimo volumes two hundred and seventeen pages in each with a fmntispiece to the rest of two tombstones and a later 
do you understand 
and you miss morland 
my star did sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions 
or talked of expected hours in london 
and instead of instantly conceiving as any rational creature would have done that such words could relate only to a circulating library 
she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men xog nonmanosn annm 
assembling in st george’s fields 
the bank attacked the power threatened the meets of london glowing with blood a attachment of the the light dragoons the hopes of the nation called up from northampton to sell the insurgents and the gallant captain frederick tilney in the moment of changing at the head of his troop knocked off his horse by a brick-hat from an upper window 
forgive her stupidity 
the fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman 
but she is by no means a simpleton in general catherine looked grave 
a and now henry a said miss tilney that you have made us understand each other you may as well make miss morland understand yourself unless you mean to have her think you intolerath rude to your sister and a great brute in you opinion of women in general 
miss morland is not used to your add ways i shall he most happy to make her better acquainted with them 
no doubt 
but that is no explanation of the present what am i to do 
you know what you ought to do 
clear your character handsomely before her 
tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women 
miss morland i think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world especially of those whoever they may be with whom i happen to be in company 
that is not enough 
be more serious 
a miss morland no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than i do 
in my opinion nature has given them so much that they never end it use a use more than half 
a we shall get nothing more serious from him now miss morland 
he is not in a sober mood 
but i northanger abbey 
oh assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all or an unkind one of me it was no effort to catherine to believe that henry tilney could never be wrong 
his manner might sometimes surprize but his meaning must always be just 
and what she did not understand the was almost as ready to admire as what she did 
the whole walk was delightful and though it ended too soon its conclusion wasdelightfultoo 
her friends attended her into the house and miss tilney before they parted addressing herself with respectful form as much to mrs allen asto catherine petitioned for the pleasure of her corn ay to dinner on the day after the next 
no defect say was made on mrs allen’s side and the only difficulty on catherine’s was in concealing the excess of her leisure 
the morning had passed away so chan-ninng us to banish all her friendship and natural affection 
for no thought of isabella or amuses crossed her mind during their walk 
when the tilney were gone she became amiable again but she was amiable for some time to little expect 
mrs allen had no intelligence to give that could relieve her anxiety 
she had heard nothing of any of them 
towards the end of the morning however catherine having occasion for some indispensable yard of ribbon which must be bought without a moment's delay walked out into the town and in bond street overtook the second miss thorpe as she was loitering towards edward buildings between two of the sweetest girls the world who had been her dear friends all the morning 
from her she soon learned that the party to clifton had taken place 
the set of 
at eight this morning said miss anne a and em tune i do not envy them theirdrive 
i think you so i are verywell offs be out of the scrape 
it must he the dullest thing in the world for there is not a soul it clifton at this 108 nonmanoen new 
time of the 
balls went with your brother and john drove aria.” catherine spoke the pleasure she really felt on hearing thin part of the amngernent 
a oh 
yes a rejoined the other a maria is one 
she was quite wild to go 
she thought it won d be something very one 
i can not say i admire her taste 
and for my part i was determined from the first not to go if they pressed me ever in much 
catherine a little doubtful of this could not help answering 8 i wiahayou could have gone too 
it in a pity you could not i go thank you but it in quite a matter of indifference to me 
indeed i would not have gone on any account 
i wan saying no to smile and sophia when you overtook up 
a catherine was still unconvinced 
but glad that anne should have the friendship of an early and 3 sophia to console her the bade her adieu without much uneasiness and returned home pleased that the party had not been prevented by her refusing to join it and very heartily wishing that it might be too pleasantly to allow either men or isabella m resent her redatanca any longer 
chapter 13 
early the next day a note from isabella speaking peace and tenderness in every line and entreating the immediate presence of her friend on a matter of the utmost importance hastened catherine in the map lent state of confidence and curiosity to edward 
b 1 dings 
the two youngest miss thorpe were by themselves in the parlour and on anne s quitting it to call her deter catherine took the opportunity of asking northanger abbey 
11 the other for some particular of their yesterday’s rty 
x“mariaderirud no greater plemrethnntoepeakofit 
and catherine immediately learned that it had been altogether the most delightful scheme in world that nobody could imagine how charming it had been and that it had been more delightful 
than an body could conceive 
such was the information of the rat five minutes 
the second unfolded thus much in detail that they had driven directly to the york hotel ate some son and spoke an early dinner walked down to the room tasted the water and laid out some shillings in hunters and spare 
thence adjourned to eat ice at a pastrycook’s and hurrying back to the hotel swallowed their dinner in haste to prevent being in the dark and then had a delightful drive back only the room was not up and it rained a little and mr morland’s home was no tired he could hardly get it along 
catherine listened with heartfelt satisfaction 
it appeared that blame castle had never been thought of and as for all the rest there wan nothing to regret for half an instant 
maria s intelligence concluded with a tender effusion of pity for her sister anne whom the represented an ineupponably cross from being excluded the party 
a she will never forgive me i am sure 
but you know how could i help it 
john would have me go for he vowed he would not drive her because she had inch thick uncles 
i dare say the will noble in good humour again this month 
but i am determined i will not be cross 
it is not a little matter that put me out of temper 
isabella now entered the room with so eager a step and a look of wet happy importance an engaged all her friends notice 
maria was without ceremony sent away and isabella embrncing catherine thus began 
i 10 horn[ anger all“ 
yes my dear catherine it so indeed 
your penetration has not deceived you. oh that arch eye of yours 
it sees through everything.” catherine only by a look of wondering ignoronce 
a nay my beloved 
friend a eondnmgd’the other “compose youne 
am amazing suit as a 
relive 
let us sit down and taking comfort 
e and so you guessed it the moment you had my note 
sly creature 
oh 
dear catherine you alone who know my hem can judge of my present happiness 
your brother is the most charming of men 
only with i were more worthy of him 
but what will your excellent father and mother say 
oh heavens 
when i think of them i am so agitated 
catherine’s understanding began to awake 
an idea of the truth suddenl darted into her mind 
and with the natural blush of so new an emotion she cried out good heaven 
my dear isabella what do you mean 
can you 
can you really be in love with james 
a this hold surmise however she soon learnt enmprehended but half the fact 
the anxious affection which she was accused of having continually watched in isabella’s every look and action had in the course of their yesterday’s received the delightful confession of an e was over 
her hurt and faith were alike engaged to arms 
never had catherine listened to anything so full of interest wonder and joy 
her brother and her friend en gedl new to such circumstances the importance or it appeared umpeaknbly great and she contemplated it as one of those grand events of which the ordinary course of life can hard afford a return 
the strength of her feelings she could not express 
the nature of them however contented her friend 
the happiness of having such a sister was their northanger abbey 
l i l lint effusion and the fair ladies mingled in embrace 
and then of joy 
delighting however 8 catherine sincerely did in the person of the connexion it must be acknowledged that is lla far surpassed her in tender anticipation 
a you will be no infinitely dearer to me my catherine thpneitheranneormaria 
feel that i shall be to much more attached to my dear morland’s family than to my own 
this was a pitch of friendship beyond catherine 
a you are to like your dear brother continued isabella a that i quite doted on you the hint moment i saw you 
but no it always is with me the arm moment settled everything 
the very lint day that morland came to us last christmas the very hint moment i beheld him my heart was irrevocably gone 
i remember i wore my yellow gown with my hair done up in braida 
and when i came into the drawing-room and john introduced him i thought i never my anybody so handsome before.” here catherine secretly acknowled end the power of love 
for though exceedingly fond of her brother and partial to all his endowments the had never in her life thought him handsome 
a i remember too mine andrews drank tea with up that evening and wore her price-coloured mraenet 
and iii looked to heavenly that i thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her 
i could not keep a wink all night for thinking of it 
oh 
catherine the many sleepless night i have had on our brother account 1 i would not have you ruii'er ha f what i have done 
i am grown wretchedly thin i know 
but i will not pain you by describing my anxiety 
you have seen enough of it 
i feel that i have betrayed myself perpetually 
so unguarded in speaking of m partiality for the church 
but my secret i was way 
we would be safe with you i 12 northanger abbey catherine felt that nothing could 
have been safer 
but ashamed of an ignorance little expected the dared no longer confess the point nor refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate sympathy as isabella chose to consider her 
her brother she found was preparing to set off with all speed to fullerton to make known his situation and ask consent 
and here was a source of some real agitation m the mind of isabella 
catherine endeavoured to persuade her as she was herself persuaded that her father and mother would never oppose their son’s wishes 
a it is impossible 1 said the 1 for parents to be more kind or more desirous of their children happiness 
i have no doubt of their consenting immediately 
7 a morland says exactly the same a replied isabella 
and yet i dare not expect it 
my fortune will be so small 
they never can consent to it 
your brother who i but marry anybody 
a ere catherine again dispersed the force of love 
a indeed isabella you are too humble 
the miller 
once of fortune can be nothing to signify a oh 
my sweet catherine in your generous heart i know it would signify nothing but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many 
as for myself i am sure i only wish our situations were rehearsed 
had i the command of millions were i mistress of the whole world your brother would be my only choice this charming sentiment recommended as much by sense as novelty gave catherine s most pleasing remembrance of all the heroism of her acquaintance 
and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than in uttering the grand ides 
a i am sure they will consent a was her frequent declaration 
a i am sure they will be delighted with you 
a for my own part a mind isabella a my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in more would horn[ anger abbey 
13 be enough for me 
where people are really attached poverty itself in wealth grandeur i detest i would not scale in london for the naivete 
a cottage in some retired village e would be excary 
there are some charming little a about richmond a richmond 
a cried catherine 
a you must settle near fullerton 
you must be near us “lunsureishallbemieei-ableifwedonot 
if i can but be near you i shall be satisfied 
but this is idle talking 
i will not allow myself to think of such things till we have your father never 
morland says that sending it to-night to salisbury we may have it to-morrow 
to-morrow i know i shall never have courage to open the letter 
i know it will be the death of me a reverie succeeded thin conviction and when isabella spoke again it was to resolve on the quality of her wedding-gown 
their conference was put an end to by the anxious young lover himself who came to breathe his parting sigh before he set of for wilmhire 
catherine wished to congratulate him but knew not what to say and her eloquence was only in her eyes 
from them however the i but pomp of speech shone out most expressively and arms could combine them with ease 
impatient for the relation of all that he hoped at home his adieu were not long 
and they would have been yet shorter had he not been frequently detained by the urgent entreaties of his fair one that he would go 
twice was he called almost from the door by her eagerness to have him gone 
indeed morland i must drive you away 
consider how far on have to ride 
i can not hear to see you linger so 
pyonheaven’s sake waste no more time 
there go go 
i insist on it the two friends with hear now more united than ever wereimepnnbleforthe day 
and in schemes of i it northanger abbey 
sisterly happiness the hours ﬂew along 
mrs thorpe and her son who were a mind with everything and who seemed only to want r morland’s consent to consider isabella’s engagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for their family were allowed to in their counsels and add their quota 
of signiﬁcant solely and mysterious expressions to all up the measure of curiosity to be raised in the nnpri eged younger sisters 
of catherine’s aim e feelings this a sort reserve seemed neither lrin y meant nor consistently supported 
and its unkindness she would hardly have forborn pointing out had its inconsistency been less their friend 
but anne and maria soon set her heart at use by the sagacity of their 8 i know what 3 a and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit a display of family ingenuity 
on one side in the mystery of an affected secret on the other of undeﬁned discovery all equally acute 
catherine was with her friend again the next day endeavouring to support her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the delivery of the letters a need exertion 
for as the time of reasonable expectation drew near isabella became more and more desponding and before the letter arrived had worked herself into a spite of real distress 
but when it did come where could distress be found 
a i have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kind parents and am promised that everything in their power shall be done to forward my happiness 1 were the first three lines mud in one moment all was joyful security 
the brightest glow was instantly spread over isabella s centres 
all care and anxiety seemed removed her spirits became almost too high for controlled and she called herself without scruple the happiest of mortals 
mrs thorpe with tears of joy embraced her due her her son her visitor and could have embraced f the northanger abbey 
i 5 inhabitants of bath with nu'efaetion 
her heart was overflowing with tenderness 
it was dear john 1 and dear catherine at every word 
dear anne and dear maria a most immediately be made share in their felicity 
and two “dents 
at once before the name of isabella were not more than that beloved child had now well earned 
john him was no speaker in joy 
he not only bestowed on mr morland the high commendation of being one of the rest fellow in the world but were off many sentence in his raise 
the letter whence sprang felicity was short containing little more than this assurance of success 
and every particular we deferred till james could write again 
but for niculara isabella could well afford m wait 
the s was come raised in mr morland’s promote his honour we play get to make everything easy 
and by what mean their income wan to be formed whether landed property wet 
to be resigned or funded money made over was a matter in which her disinterested spirit took no concern 
she knew enough to feel secure of an honourable and ready establishment and her imagination took a rapid ﬂight over its intended felicities 
she saw herself at the end of a few weeks the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance at fullerton the envy of every valued old friend in pulteney with a carriage at her command a new name on her tickets and a brilliant exhibition of hope rings on her in her 
hen the contents of the letter were entertained john thorpe who had only waited its arrival to begin his journey to london prepared to set off a well miss morland 1 said he on finding her alone in the parlour 8 i am come to bid you good-by.” catherine wished him a good journey 
without appearing to hear her he walked to the window fidgeted about hundred a tune and seemed wholly elf-occupied 
1 16 northanger abbey 
shall not you be late at devizes pay a said catherine 
he made no answer 
but 
after a minute's silence burst out with 7 a famous good thing this marrying scheme was my soul 
a clever fancy of morland’s and bella 
hat do you think of it miss morland 
i say it is no bad notion 
a i am sure i think it a very good one 
do you i 
that honest 
by heavens 
i am glad you are no enemy to matrimony however 
did you ever hear the old song going to one wedding brings on another a 
i say you will come to balls wedding i ho up a as 
i have promised your sister to he with her if possible 
a and then you know 
— trusting himself about and forcing a foolish laugh 
i say then you know we may the truth of this same old sought a yes we 
but i never sing 
well i wish you a good journey 
i dine with miss ’i‘ilney to-day and must now be going home 7 a nay but there is no such confounded hurry 
who knows when we may be together again put not but that i shall be down again by the end of a fortnight and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me 
then why do you my away so long 
a replied catherine finding that he waited for an answer 
that is kind of you however 
kind and good 
natured 
i shall not forget it in a hurry 
but you have more good-nature and all that than anybody living i believe 
a monstrous deal of good-nature and it is not only good-nature but you have so much 
so much of everything 
and then you have such 
upon my soul i do not know any body like you a oh dear 
there are a great many on he like me i darensay only a great deal better 
brood morning to you 
northanger abbey 
i i 7 a but i nay miss morland i shall come and pay my respects at fullerton before it in long if not his 
agrmhle.” 1 pray do 3 my father and mother will be very glad to see you 
a and i hope hope miss morland you will not be sorry to see me 
oh dear 
not at all 
there are very few people i am sorry to see 
company it always cheerﬁzl.’ 1 that is not my way of thinking 
give me but 1 little cheerfulj company let me only have the company of the people i love let me only be where i like and with whom i like and the devil take the rest my i 
and i am heartily glad to hear you say the name 
but i have a notion miss morland you and i think pretty much alike upon most mature 1 perhaps we may 
but it is more than i ever thought of 
and as to mark martin to say the truth there are not many that i know my own mind about by love no more do i 
it is not my way to other in brains with what does not concern me 
my notion oly thin in simple enough 
let me only have the girl like any i with a comfortable house over my head and what care i for all the rest 
f fortune in nothing 
i am sure of a good income of my own 
and if the had not a pen why no much the better ever me 
i think kite you there 
if there is a good fortune on one side there can be no occasion for any on the other 
no matter which has it so that there it enough 
hate the idea of one great fortune looking out or another 
and to marry for money i think the wicked thing in existence 
good day 
we shall be very glad to see you at fullerton whenever it is convenience and was she went 
it wan not in the power of all his entry to detain her longer 
with such new to communicate 
and inch 3 visit to 118 rsonmmcen sneer 
prepare for her departure was not to be delayed by anything in his nature to urge 
and she hurried away leaving him to the undivided consciousness of his own ha s address and her explicit encouragement 
he agitation which she had herself experienced on first learning her brother's engagement made her e ct to raise no inconsiderable emotion in mr and rs allen by the communications the wonderful event 
how great was her disappointment 
the in rank affair which many words of preparation ushered us had been foreseen by them both ever since her brother's arrival 
and all that the felt on the occasion_was comprehended in a wish or the young people happiness with a remark on the gentleman a side in favour of isabella’s beauty and on the lady of her great good luck 
it was to catherine the most surprising insensibility 
the disclosure however of the great secret of james going to lfullerwn the day before did raise name emotion in mrs allen 
she could not listen to that with perfect calmness but me eatedly regretted the necessity of its concealmengwishe she could have known his intention wished she could have seen him before he went as she should certainly have troubled him with her best regards to his father and mother and her kind compliments to all the sisters 
than 14 
catherine expectations of pleasure from her visit in milsom street were so very high that disappointment was inevitable 
and accordingly though she was most politely received by general tilney and kindly welcomed by his daughter 
though henry meat home and no one else of the party she found on her mum without spending many hours in the northanger abbey 
l 19 examination of her feelings that she had gone to her s appointment preparing for happiness which it had not rded 
instead of finding herself improved in acquaintance with miss tilney from the intercourse of the day she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before 
instead of seeing henry tilney to greater advantage than ever in the ease of a family party he had never said so little nor been so little agreeable 
and in spite of their fathers great civilities to her in spite of his thanks invitations and compliments it had been a release to get way from him 
it puzzled her to account for all this 
it could not be general tilney’s fault 
that he was perfectly agreeable and good-natured and altogether a very charming man did not admit of a doubt 
for he was tall and handsome and henry’s father 
he could not be accountable for his children want of s merits or for her want of enjoyment in his company 
he former she hoped at last might have been accidenml and the latter she could only attribute to her own stupidity 
isabella on hearing the class of the visit gave a different explanation 
a it was all pride pride 
insufferable haughu'ness and pride 
she had long suspected the family to be very high and this made is certain 
such insolence of behaviour as miss tilney’s she had never heard of in her life 
not to do the honours of her house with common good breeding 
to behave to her guest with such supeteiliousnessl hardly even to speak to her 
a but it was not so bad as that isabella 
there was no in rciliousness 
she was very civilly 4 he done defend her 
and then the brother he who had appeared so attached to you 
good heavens well some people's feelings are incomprehensible 
and so he hardly looked once at you the whole day 2

how contemptihlel of all things in the world inconstancy in my aversion 
let me entreat you never to think of him again my dear catherine 
indeed he is unworthy of your unworthy 
i do not suppose he ever think of me a that is exactly what i say 5 he never thinks of you 
such ﬁckleness 
oh how different to your brother and to mine 
i really believe john has the most common heart 
4 but as for general till i assure you it would be impossible for any body to have to me with greater civility and attention 
it seemed to be his only cure to entertain and make me happy “oh 
i know no harm of him 
i do not suspect him of ride 
i believe he is a very gentleman-like man 
one thinks very well of him and john judgment 
a well i shall lee how they behave to me this evening 
we shall meet them at the rooms 
and must i go 
do not you intend it 
i thought it was all nenled.” “nay since you make inch 3 point of it i can refuse you nothing 
but do not insist upon my being very agreeable for my heart you know will be some forty miles off 
and us for dancing do not mention it i beg 
be 
ll quite out of the question 
charles hodges will plague me to death i dare say 
but i shall cut him very short ten to one but he guessed the reason and that in exactly what i want to avoid 
so i shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself 
isabella’s opinion of the tilney did not influence her friend 
she was sure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or sister 
and the did not northanger abbey 
i 2 1 credit there being any pride in their hearts 
the evening rewarded her confidence 
she was met by one with the same kindness and the other with the some attention as heretofore 
miss tilney took pains to be near her and henry asked her to dance 
having heard the day before in milsom street that their elder brother captain tilney 
was expected almost every hour she was at no loss for the name of a very fashionable-looking handsome young man whom she had never seen before and who now evidently belonged w their party 
she looked at him with great admiration 
and even supposed it possible that some people might think him handsomer than his brother though in her eyes his air was more assuming and his countenance less prepossessing 
his taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly inferior 
for within her hearing he not only protested against every thought of dancing himself but even laughed openly at henry for sending it possible 
from the latter circumstance it may be presumed that whatever might be our heroine’s opinion of him his admiration of her was not of a very dangerous kind 
not likely to produce animosities between the brother nor persecutions to the lady 
he can not be the instigator of the three villains in horsemen’s great coats by whom she will hereafter be forced into a travelling chaise and four which will drive of 
with incredible speed 
catherine meanwhile undisturbed by presentiments of such an evil or of any evil at all except that of having but a short set to dance down enjoyed her usual happiness with henry tilney listening with sparkling eyes to everything he said 
and in finding him irresistible becoming so herself 
at the end of the first dance captain tilney came towards them again and much to catherine’s dissatisfaction pulled his brother away 
they retired whispering together 
and though her delicate sensibility did i i 2 2 northanger abbey 
not take immediate alarm and lay it down as fact that captain tilney must have heard some malevolent misrepresentation of her which he now hastened to communicate to his brother in the hope of separating them for ever she could not have her partner conveyed from her sight without very uneasy sensations 
her suspense was of full five minutes duration 
and she was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an hour when they both returned 
and an explanation was given by henry’s requesting to know if the thought her friend miss thorpe would have any objection to dancing as his brother would be most happy he introduced to her 
catherine without hesitation replied that she was ve sure miss thorpe did not mean to dance at all 
he cruel say was passed on to the other and he immediately led away 
your brother will not mind it i know a said she a because i heard him say before that he hated dancing 
but it was very good-natured in him to think of it 
i so pose he saw isabella sitting down a and fancied she might wish for a partner 
but he is quite mistaken for she would not dance upon any account in the world henry smiled and said a how very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people's actions.” a why 
what do you mean is a with you it is not how is such a one likely to be influenced 
what is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person s feelings age situation and probable habits of life considered 
but how should i inﬂuenced 
what would be my inducement in acting so and so pay a i do not understand you a then we are on very unequal terms for i understand you perfectly well north anger abbey 
l 2 3 a me or yes 
i can not speak well enough to be unintelligible a brave 
an excellent satire on modern language 
a us may tell me what you mean a s i indeed 
do you really desire it 
but you are not aware of the consequences 
it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment and certainly bring on a disagreement between us a no no 
it shall not do either 
am not afraid 
a well then i only meant that your attﬁbudng my brother wish of dancing with miss thorpe to goodnature alone convinced me of your being superior in good-nature yourself to all the rest of the world 
catherine blushed and disclaimed and the gentleman’redictions were derived 
there was a something 
never in his word.which repaid her for the pain of confusion 
and that something occupied her mind so much that she drew back for some time forgetting to kiss or to listen and almost forgetting where she was 
till roused by the voice of isabella she looked up and saw her with captain tilney preparing to give them hands across 
isabella charged her shoulders and smiled 
the only explanation of this extraordinary change which could at that time be given 
but as it was not quite enough for catherine’s comprehension she spoke her astonishment in very plain terms to her partner 
a i can not think how it could happen 
isabella was so determined not to dance 
a and did isabella never change her mind before 2 7 a oh 
but because and your brother 
after what you told him from me how could he think of going to ask her i 7 a i can not take surprise to m if on that head 
you bid me be surprized on your friend s account and therefore i am 
but as for my brother his conduct in 124 
northanger abbey 
the business i must own has been no more than i be 
loved him perfectly equal to 
the easiness of your friend was an open attraction 
her firmness you know could only be understood by yourself 3 you are laughing 
but i assure you isabella is very warm in general a it is as much as should be said of any one 
to be always ﬁrm must be to be often obstinate 
when proly to delay is the trial of judgment 
and without reference to my brother i really dunk miss thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present house the friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse all all the dancing was over 
but then as they walked about the room arm in arm 
isabella thus explained herself i do not wonder at your surprise 
and i am really fatigued to death 
he is such a rattle 
amusing enough if my mind had been disengaged 
but i would have given the world to sit still 
a then why did not you pay a oh 
my dear it would have looked so particular 
and you know how i abhor doing that 
i refused him as long as i possibly could but he would take no denial 
you have no idea how he pressed me 
i begged him to excuse me and get some other partner 
but no not he 
after assuring to my hand there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of 
and it was not that he wanted merely to dance he wanted to be with me 
oh such nonsense 
i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me 
for of all things in the world i hated ﬁne speeches and compliments 
— 
and so 
and so then i found there would be no peace if i did not stand up 
besides i thought mrs hughes who introduced him might take it ill if i did not 
and your dear brother i am sure he would have been miserable if i had sat down the whole evening 
i “orthanger abbey l 25 am so glad it is over 
my spirits are quite added with listening to his nonsense 
and then being such a smart young fellow i saw every eye was upon us 
4 he is very handsome indeed 
handsome 
yes i suppose he may 
i dare nyaﬁeople would admire him in general 
but he is not at in my style of beauty 
i hate a word complexion and dark eyes in a man 
however he is very well 
amazingly conceited i am sure 
i took him down several times you know in my way when the young ladies next met they had a far more interesting subject to discuss 
james morland’s second letter was then received and the kind intentions of his father fully ex lained 
a living of which mr morland was himself patron and incumbent of about four hundred pounds yearly value was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old enough to take it 
no trifling deduction from the family income no niggardly assignment to one often children 
an estate of at least equal value moreover was assured at his future inheritance 
james expressed himself on the occasion with becoming gratitude 
and the necessity of waiting between two and three years before they could marry being however unwelcome no more than he had expected was born by him without discontent 
catherine whose expectations had been as vexed as her ideas of her father income and whose judgment was now entirely led by her brother felt equally well satisfied and hastily congratulated isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled 
a it is very charming indeed said isabella with a grave face 
a mr morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed a laid the gentle mrs the looking anxiously at her daughter 
i only wish would do as much 
one no northanger sunny 
could not expect more from him you know 
if he finds he as do more by-snd-bye i dare say he will 
for i am sure he must be an excellent good-hearted nun 
four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed 
but your wishes my dear isabella are so moderate you do not consider how little you ever want my dear 
it is not on my own account i wish for more 
but i can not hear to be the means of injuring my dear morland making him sit down upon an income hardly en ought to and one in the common necessaries of life 
for myself it is nothing 
i never think of myself i know you never do my dear 
and you will always and your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you 
there never was a young woman so beloved as you are i everybody that knows you 
and i dare say when s morland sees you my dear child 
but do not let us distress our dear catherine by talking of such things 
mr morland has behaved so very handsome you know 
i always heard he was a mostexcellent man 
and you know my dear we are not to suppose but what if you had had a suitable fortune he would have come down with something more 
for i am sure he must be a most liberal-minded man a nobodycnn think better of mr morland than i do i am sure 
but everybody has their failing you know 
and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money 
catherine was hurt by these insinuations 
i am very sure a said she that my father has promised to do as much as he can aﬂord.” inbells recollected herself 
a as to that my sweet catherine there can not be a doubt and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me 
it is not the want of more money northanger abbey 
i 2 7 that makes me just at present a little out of spirits 
i hate money 
and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a m i should not have a wish unsatisﬁed 
ah 
my catherine you have found me on there the sting 
the long long endless two years and a half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living a yes yes my darling isabella a said mrs thorpe a we perfectly see into your heart 
you have no disguise 
we rfectl understand the present vexation 
and even my must love you the better for such a noble honest affection.” catherine’s uncomfortable feelings began to lessen 
she endeavoured to believe that the delay of the marriage was the only source of isabella’s regret 
and when she saw her at their next interview as cheerful and amiable as ever endeavoured to forget that she had for a minute thought otherwise 
james soon followed his letter and was received with the most gratifying kindness 
chapter 13 
he allen had now entered on the sixth week of their stay in bath 
and whether it should be the last was for some time a question to which catherine listened with a beating heart 
to have her acquaintance with the tilney end so soon was an evil which nothing could counterbalance 
her whole happiness seemed at stake while the affair was in use and every thing secured when it was determined that the loss gings should be taken for another fortnight 
what this additional fortnight was to prove due to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing henry tilney made but a small part of catherine’s r 28 northanger sassy 
speculation 
once or twice indeed since james’s engagement had taught her what mold be done she had got so far as to indulge in a secret perhaps a but in general the felicity of being with him for the present bounded her views the present was now comprised in another three weeks and her happiness being remains for that period the rest of her life was at such s distance is to excite but little interest 
in the course of the morning which saw this business arranged she visited miss tilney and poured forth her joy ful feelings 
it was doomed to he a day of trial 
i sooner had she expressed her delight in mr allen’s lengthened stay than miss tilney told her of her father s having determined upon quitting bath by the end of another week 
here was a blow 
the past suspense of the morning had been ease and quiet to the present disappointment 
catherine’s countenance fell 
and in a voice of most sincere concern she echoed miss tilney’s concluding words a by the end of another week 
a yes 
my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what i think a fair trial 
he has been disappointed of some friends arrival whom he expected to meet here and as he is now pretty well is in s hurry to get home a i am very sorry for it a said catherine dejectcdly 
a if i had known this before a 1 perhaps a said miss tilney in an embarrassed manner you would be so good 
it would make me very happy if 4 he entrance of her father put a stop to the civility which catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding 
after addressing her with his usual politeness he turned to his daughter and said a well eleanor may i congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend or a northanger abbey 
l 29 i was just beginning to make the request sir as you came into 
well proceed i all means 
i know how much your been is in it 
my daughter miss morland 4 he continued without leaving his daughter time to s at a has been forming a very bold wish 
we leave earth as she has perhaps told you on saturday se'ennight 
a letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted at home 
and being disappointed in m hope of seeing the martins of london and general ourteney here some of my very old friends there is nothing to detain me longer in bath 
and could we csrryour selﬁsh point with you should leave it without a single regret 
can you in short be prevailed on to it this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend leaves with your company in gloucestershire 
i am almost ashamed to make the request though its presumption would certainly appear greater to buy crea 
sure in bath than yourself 
modesty such as your 
but not for the world would i pain it by open praise 
if a can be induced to honour us with a visit you willyhmke us happy beyond expression 
this true we can makes you nothing like the gaieties of this livel place 
we can tern t you neither by amusement nor splendour for our m e of living as you see is plain and unpretending at no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make onhanger abbey not wholly disagreeable 
northanger abbey 
these were trifling words and wound up catherine’s feelings to the highest points of extasy 
her grateful and gratified heart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language of tolerable calmness 
to receive so flattering an invitation to have her company so warmly solicited 
everything honourable and soothing every present enjoyment and every future hope was contained in it and he acceptance with only the saving cause of papa and 12 northanger abbey 
mamma approbation was eagerly given 
a i will write home direct yes a said she a and if they do not object as i dare say they will not 
general sneyd was not less sanguine having already waited on her excellent friends in pulteney street and obtained their sanction of his wishes 
7 a since they can consent to part with you said he we may expect philosophy from all the world 
miss t sneyd was earnest though gentle in her secondary civilities and the affair became in a few minutes as nearly settled as this necessary reference to fullerton would allow 
the circumstances of the morning had led catherine’s feelings through the varieties of suspense security and disappointment but they were now safely lodged in perfect bliss 
and with s merits elated to rapture with henry at her heart and orthanger abbey on her i she hurried home to write her letter 
mr and i morland relying on the discretion of the friends 
s whom they had already entrusted their daughter felt no doubt of the propriety of an acquaintance which had been formed under their eye and sent therefore by return of post their ready consent to her visit in gloucestershire 
this indulgence though not more than catherine had hoped for completed her conviction of being favoured beyond every other human creature in friends and fortune circumstance and chance 
everything seemed taco-operate for her advantage 
by the kindness of her first friends the allen she had been introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met her 
her feelings her preference had each known the happiness of a return 
wherever the felt attachment she had been able to create it 
the affection of isabella was to be secured to her in a sister 
the tilney they by whom above all she desired to be favourably thought of outstripped even her wishes in the 24 northanger abbey 
i 3 i ﬂattering measures by which their intimacy was to be continued 
she was to be their chosen visitor she was to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose society she mostly prized 
and in addition to all the rent this roof was to be the roof of an abbey 
her passion for ancient dances was next in degree to her passion for henry tilney and castles sod sbhiea mode usually the charm of those reveries which his image did not all 
to see and explore either the ramparts and keep of the one or the sisters of the other had been for many weeks a darling wish though to be more than the visitor of an hour had seemed loo nearly impossible for desire 
and yet this was to happen 
with all the chances against her of house hall place park court and cottage northanger turned up an abbey said she was to be its inhabitant its ong damp passages its narrow wells and ruined chapel 
were to be within her daily reach and she could not entirely subdue the hope of some traditional legends some awful memorials of an injured and illfsted nun 
it was wonderful that her friends should seem so little elated by the possession of such a home 
that the consciousness of it should be so weak born 
the power of early habit only could account or it 
a distinction to which they had been born gave no pride 
their superiority of abode was no more to them than their superiority of person 
man were the inquiries she was eager to make or miss lzilney 
but so active were her thoughts that when these inquiries were lowered she was hardly more assured than before of northanger abbey having been s richly endowed convent at the time of the reformation of its having fallen into the hands of an actor of the tilney on its resolution of a large portion of the ancient building still making a part of the 1 32 v northanger abbey 
resent dwelling although the rest was delayed or of its standing low in a valley sheltered from the north andeastby rising woodso oak 
chapter 33 
it 
a mind thus full of happiness catherine was hardly aware that two or three days had passed away without her seeing isabella for more than a few minutes together 
she began trust to be sensible of this and to sigh for her conversation as the walked along the pump-room one morning by mrs allen’s side without anything to say or to hear 
and scarcely had she felt a five minutes longing of friendship before the object of it appeared and inviting her to a secret conference led the way to a seat 
this is my favourite place said she as they sat down on a bench between the doors which commanded a tolerable view of everybody entering at either it is so out of the way catherine observing that isabella’s eyes were continually bent towards one door or the other as in eager expectation and remembering how often she had been falsely accused of being arch thought the present a one rtunity for being really so and therefore gaily said a i not be uneasy isabella 
james will soon be here 
she 
my dear creature 1 she replied 1 do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to convince him to my elbow 
it would be hideous to be always together 
we should be the jest of the place 
and so you are going to northanger 
i am amazingly glad of it 
it is one of the finest old places in england i understand 
i shall depend upon a most particular description of it 
northanger abbey 
1'33 3 you shall certainly have the best in my power to give 
but who are you looking for 
are your sister coming 
7 a i am not looking for anybody 
one eyes must be somewhere and you know what a foolish trick i have of fixing mine when my thoughts are an hundred miles 011 
i am amazingly about 
i believe i am the most absent creature in the world 
tilney says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp.” 3 but i thought isabella you had something in particular to tell me up 7 a oh yes 
and so i have 
but here is a proof of what i was saying 
my poor head 
i had quite forgot it 
well the thing is this i have just had a letter from john 
you can guess the contents a no indeed i can not he a my sweet love do not be so abominably aﬁected 
what can he write about but yourself 
you know he is over head and ears in love with you a with me dear isabella 
7 a no my sweetest catherine this is being quite absurd 
modesty and all that is very well in its way but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming 
i have no idea of being so overstmined 
it is wishing for compliments 
his attentions were such as a child must have noticed and it was but half an hour before he left bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement 
he says so in this letter 
says that he as good as made you an offer and that you received his advances in the kindest way and now he wants me to urge his suit and say all manner of pretty things to you 
so it is in vain no object ignorance 
catherine with all the earnestness of truth expressed her astonishment at such a charge protesting her innocence of every thought of mr thorpe s being in love with her and the consequent impossibility of her having 
34 northanger abbey 
ever intended to encourage him 
as to any attentions on his side i do declare upon my honour i never was sensible of them for a moment except just his asking me to dance the hint day of his coming 
and as to making me an offer or any thing like it there must be some unaccountable mistake 
i could not have mieundemood a thing of that kind you know 
and up i ever wish to be believed i solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us 
the last half hour before he went away 
it must be all and completely a mistake for i did not see him once that whole morning 
but bad or certainly did for you spent the whole morning in goddard s buildings 
it was the day your father s consent came and i am pretty sure that you and john were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house 
are you 
well if you say it it was so i dare say 
but for the life of me i can not recollect it 
i do remember now being with you and seeing him an well an the rest 
but that we were ever alone for five minutes 
however it is not worth arguing about for whatever might pass on his side you must be convinced by my hair g no recollection of it 
that never thought nor expected nor wished for anything of the kind from him 
i am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side 
i never had the smallest idea of it 
pray undeceive him as soon as yours and tell him i beg his pardon 
that is i do not know what i ought to say 
but make him understand what i mean in the properest way 
i would not speak disrespectfully of a rather of ours isabella i am sure but you know very well that i could think of one man more than another it is not the person isabella was silent 
a my dear friend you must not be angry with me 
i can not supply northanger linear 
135 pose your brother cares so very much about me 
and you know we shall still be sisters yes yes a selfish a blush there are more ways than one of our ‘ng sisters 
but where am i wanderingto 
well my dear catherine the case seems to be 
that you are determined against poor john is not it so 
a i certainly can not return his aﬂ‘ecﬁ'on and as certainly never meant to encourage it since that is the case i am sure i shall not tease you any further 
john desired me to speak to you on the subject and therefore i have 
but i confess as soon as i read this letter i thought it a very foolish t imprudent business and not likely to promote the good of either 
for what were you to live upon supposing you came together 
you have both of you something to be sure but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays 
and after all that romancers may say there is no doing without money 
i only wonder john could think of it 
he could not have received my last 
you do acquit me then of anything wrong 
you i are convinced that i never meant to deceive your brother never suspected him of liking me till this moment 
a oh 
as to that answered isabella laughingly 8 i do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been 
all that is best known to yourself 
a little harmless station or so will occur and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by 
but you may be assured that i am the last s in the world to judge you severely 
all those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirit 
what one man one day you know one may not mean the next 
circumstances change opinions alter 
but my opinion of your brother never did alter 
it l 36 northanger abbey 
was always the same 
you are describing what never happened 3 my dearest catherine continued the other without at all listening to her a i would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about 
i do not think an long would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice as your happiness merely to oblige my brother because he is my brother and who perhaps after all you know might be just as happy without you 
for people seldom know what they would be at young men espeda‘l’ly they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant 
hat i say is why should a brother happiness be dearer to me than a friend 
you know i carry my notions of friendship pretty high 
but above all things my dear catherine do not be in a hurry 
take my word for it that if you are in too great a hurry you will certainly live to repent it 
tilney says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections 
and i believe he is very right 
ah 
here he comes 
never mind he will not see us i am sure a catherine looking up perceived captain tilney 
and isabella earnestly fixing her eye on him as she spoke soon caught his notice 
he approached immediately 1 and took the seat to which her movements invited him 
his first address made catherine start though spoken low she could distinguish a what 
always to be watched in person or by proxy 
a push nonsense 
a was isabella’s answer in the same half whisper 
a why do you put such things into my head 
if i could believe it l 
my spirit you know is pretty independence a i wish your heart were independent 
that would be enough for me my heart indeed 
what can you have to do with hearts 
you men have none of you any hearts.” northanger assay 
34 if we have not hearts we have eyes 
and they give us torment enough to they 
i am sorry for it 
i am sorry they and an g so disagreeable in me 
i will look another way 
hope this pleases you a turning her back on him 
a i hope your eyes are not tormented now a never more so forth edge of a blooming cheek is still in view 
at once too much and too little catherine heard all this and quite out of countenance could listen no longer 
amazed that isabella could endure it and jealous for her brother she rose up and saying she should join mrs allen proposed their walking 
but for this isabella showed no inclination 
she was so amazingly tired and it was so odious to parade about the pump-room 
and if she moved from her seat she should miss her sisters she was expecting her sisters every moment so that her dearest catherine must excuse her and must sit quietly down again 
but catherine could be stubborn too 
and mrs allen just then coming up to propose their returning home she joined her and walked out of the pump-room leaving isabella still sitting with captain tilney 
with much uneasiness did she thus leave them 
it seemed to her that captain tilney was falling in love with isabella and isabella unconsciously encouraging him 
unconsciously it must be for isabella’s attachment to james was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement 
to doubt her truth or good intentions was impossible 
and yet during the whole of their conversation her manner had been odd 
she wished isabella had talked more like her usual self and not so much about money 
and had not looked so well pleased at the light of captain tilney 
how strange that she should not perceive his admiration 
catherine longed to give her a hint of it to put her on her guard and prevent ill the pain which her too lively behaviour k r 38 nonmnuozn abbey 
might otherwise create both for him and her brother 
the corn liment of john thorpe’l affections did not make men for thin thoughtlemeu in his sister 
she was almost as far from believing as from wishing it to be sincere 
for the had not forgotten that he could minalte 
and his assertion of the offer and of her encouragement convinced her that his mistaken could mmetirnee be very gracious 
in vanity therefore the gained but little her chief pratt was in wonder 
that he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in love with her war a matter of lively anoniahment 
isabella talked of hit attendant 
no had never been sensible of any 
but isabella had said many things which the hoped had been spoken in hate and would never be laid again 
and upon this the was glad to rest together for present ease and comfort 
cbtnm 13 ﬂ 
few days passed away and catherine though not allowing herself to inspect her friend could not help watching her closely 
the result of her obeervan'one was not agreeable 
isabella seemed an altered creature 
when the raw her indeed surrounded only by their immediate friend 
in edward buildings or pulteney street her change of manners was to trying that had it gone no farther it might have passed unnoticed 
a something of languid indifference or of that boasted absence of mind which catherine had never heard of before would coca-ionally come across her 
but had nothing worse appeared ibo might only have spread a new grace and inquired a warmer interest 
but when catherine saw her in nonmanonn abbey 
33 public admitting captain tilney’s attentions as readily as they were offered and allowing him almost an equal share with james in her notice and smiles the alteration became too positive to be past over 
what could be meant by such unsteady conducrtwhat her friend could be at was beyond her 
comprehendon 
isabella could not be aware of the pain she was inviting 
but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which catherine could not but resent 
james was the sufferers 
she saw him grave and uneasy 
and however careless of his present comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart to over it was always an object 
for poor captain tilney too she was greatly concerned 
though his looks did not please her his name was a passion to her goodwill and she thought with sincere companion of his approaching disappointment 
for in to of what she had believed herself to overhear in thengumproom his behaviour was so incompao'bh with a knowledge of isabella’s engagement that she could not upon reﬂection imagine him aware of it 
he might be jealous of her brother as a rival but if more had seemed implied the fault must have been in her misapprehension 
she wished by a gentle remonatrance to remind isabella of her situation and make her aware of this double unkindness 
but for remonmnce either of utility or comprehension was always against her 
able to suggest a hint isabella could never under it 
in this distress the intended do nature of the tilney family became her chief conso ation 
their journey into gloucestenhire was to take place within a few days and captain tilney’s removal would at lean restore peace to every heart but his own 
but captain tilney had at present no intention of removing 
he was not to be of the state northanger he was to continue at bath 
hen catherine knew this her resolution was directly made 
she spoke to henry 16 northanger abbey 
till on the subject regretting his brother evident ﬂ try for miss thorpe and entreating him to make own her prior engagement 
a my brother does know it a was henry’s answer 
does he i then why does he stay here i 
he made no reply and was beginning to talk of something else 
but she eagerly continued a why do i not you persuade him to go away 
the longer he stays the worse it will be for him at last 
pray advise him for his own take and for everybody sake leave bath directly 
absence will in time make him comfortable again 
but he can have no hope here and it is only at no to be miserable henry smiled and said a am sure my brother would not wish to do that 
a then you will persuade him to go away 
a persuasion in not at command 
but pardon me if i can not even endeavour to persuade him 
i have myself told him that miss thorpe is engaged 
he knows what he in about and must be his own master 
a no he does not know what he in about a cried catherine 
4 he does not know the pain he is giving my brother 
not that james has ever told me so but i am sure he is very uncomfortable 1 and are you sure it is my brother doing 2 7 a yes very sure 
is it my brother attention to miss thorpe or miss 
rhorpe’s admission of them that gives the in a play a it not it the same thing 
7 a i think mr morland would acknowledge a difference 
no man in offended by another man admiration of the woman he loves 
it in the woman only who can make it a torment.” catherine blushed for her friend and said a isabella in wrong 
but i am sure she can not mean to torment northanger abbey 
14th for she is very much attached to my brother 
she has been in love with him ever since they first met and while m father’s consent was uncertain she fretted herself most into a fever 
you know she must be attached to him 
a i understand 
she is in love with james and hints with frederick 7 a oh no not ﬂirts 
a woman in love with one man can not dirt with another 
7 a it is probable that she will neither love no well nor first so well as she might do either bingley the gentlemen must each give up a little 
after a short pause catherine resumed with 
then you do not believe isabella so very much attached to my brother a i can have no opinion on that subject but what can your brother mean 
if he knows her engagement what can he mean by his behaviour s 
a you are a very close uestioner.’ a am i 
only ask to want be told 
but do you only ask what i can be expected to tell 7 a yes i think so 
for you must know your brother heart 
7 a my brother heart as you term it on the present occasion i assure you i can only guess at 
well 
a well 
nay if it is to be guesswork let us all guest for ourselves 
to be guided by second-hand conjecture is pitiful 
the premises are before you 
my brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man 
he has had about a week s acquaintance with your friend and he has known her engagement almost a long as he has known her well a said catherine sir some moments conideration “_yssmaybesblemguess at your brother 42 northanger abbey 
inteno’nnl from all thin 
but i am me i can not 
but in not or father uncomfortable about it 
does not he want captain tilney to go away 
sure if your father were to speak to him he would go my dear miss morland 1 laid henry in thin amiable solicitude for your brother comfort may you not be a little mistaken 
are you not carried a little too far 
would he thank you either on his own account or miss thorpe’n for supposing that her affection or at least her good behaviour is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of captain l‘ilney 
ii he safe only in solitude 
or in her heart constant to him only when solicited by any one else 
he can not think this and on my be sure that he would not have you think it 
will not say do not be on a because i know that you are so at this moment 
t be an little uneasy at you can 
you have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend 
depend upon it therefore that real jealouly never can exist between them 
depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration 
their hearts are open to each other at neither heart can be to on they know exactly what in required and what can home 
and you may be certain that one will never tune the other beyond what in known to be extant.” perceiving her ill to look doubtful an grave he added “though frederick does not leave bath with us he will probably remain but a very short time perhaps i only a few days behind us 
his leave of absence soon sex and he must return to his regiment 
and what then be their acquaintance the nuns-room will drink isabella thorpe for a fortnight and she will laugh with your brother over poor tilney passion for a month catherine would contend no longer againn comfort she had resisted it approacheo during the whole length northanger a boy 
i 43 of a speech but it now carried her caprice 
henry tilney must know best 
she blamed herself for the extent of her fears and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject again 
her resolution was support by isabella’s behaviour in their parﬁnéinterview 
the horses spent the last evening of tben'ne’s stay in pulteney street and nothing passed between the lovers to excite her uneasiness or make her it them in up rehension 
james was in excellent spirits and isabella most engagineg placid 
her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart but that at such a moment was allowable 
and once she gave her lover a hat contradiction and once she drew back her hand but catherine remembered henry’s instructions and placed it all to judicious affection 
the embraces tears and promises of the parting fair ones maybe fancied 
charm 5 
s and mrs allen were sorry to lose their young friend whose good humour and chuse news had made her a valuable companion and in the promotion of whose enjoyment their own had been gently increased 
her happiness in going with miss tilney however prevented their wishing it otherwise 
and as they were to remain only one more week in bath themselves her quitting them now would not long be felt 
mr allen attended her to milsom street where she was to breakfast and saw her seated with the kindest welcome among her new friends 
but so great was her agitation in finding herself as one of the family and so fearful was she of not doing exactly what was right and of not being able to preserve their good x 44 northanger abbey 
opinion that in the embarrassment of the first live minutes she could almost have wished to return with him to pulteney street 
miss tilney’s manners and henry’s smile soon did away some of her pleasant feelings but still she was far from being at ease 
nor could the incessant attentions of the general himself entirely re-assnre her 
nay perverse as it seemed she doubted whether she might not have felt less had she been less attended to 
his anxiety for her comfort his continual solicitations that she would eat and his often-expressed fears of her seeing nothing to her taste though never in her life before had she beheld half such variety on a breakfast-table made it impossible for her to forget for a moment that she was a visitor 
she felt utterly unworthy of such respect and knew not how to reply to it 
her tranquillity was not i roused by the general’s impatience for the appearance of his eldest son nor by the displeasure he expressed at his happiness when captain tilney at last came down 
she was quite pained by the severity of his father reproof which seemed disproportionatc to the offence 
and much was her concern increased when she found herself the principal cause of the lecture 
and that his steadiness was chiefly resented from being disrespectful to her 
this was placing her in a very uncomfortable situation and she felt great com passion for ca tain tilney without being able to hope or his good wife 1 
he listened to his father in silence and attempted not any defence which confirmed her in fearing that the inquietude of his mind on isabella’s account might by keeping him long sleepless have been the real cause of his rising late 
it was the first time of her being decided in his company and she had hoped to be now able to arm her opinion of him but she scarcely heard his voice while his father remained in the room 
and xmr'rmrtosk abbey 
45 even afterwards so much were his spirits affected she could distinguish nothing but these words in a whisper to e lesson a how glad i shall be when you are all or 
6 the bustle of going was not pleasant 
the clock struck ten while the trunks were carrying down and the general had fixed to be out of milsom street by that hour 
his great coat instead of being brought for him to put on directly was spread out in the curricle in which he was to accompany his son 
the middle seat of the chaise was not drawn out though there were three people to go in it and his daughters maid had so crowded it with parcels that miss morland would not have room to sit 
and so much was he intended by this apprehension when he handed her in that she had some difficulty in saving her own new writingodeslt from being thrown out into the street 
at last however the door was closed upon the three females and they set of at the sober pace in which the handsome highly-fed four horses of a gentleman usually perform a journey of thirty miles such was the‘distance of northanger from bath to be now divided into two equal stages 
catherine’s spirits revived as they drove from the door 
for with miss tilney she felt no restraint 
and with the interest of a road entirely new to her of an abbey before and a curricle behind she caught the last view of bath without any regret and met with every milestone before she expected it 
the tediousness of a two hours wait at petty farce in which there was nothing to be done but to eat without being hungry and later about without anything to see next followed 
and her admiration of the style in which they travelled of the fashionable chaise and four postillions handsomely liveried rising so regularly in their stirrups and numerous outriders properly mounted sunk s little under this consequent inconvenience 
44 northanger sassy 
their 8 been perfectly agreeable the delay would have nothing 
but general tilney though so charming a man seemed always a check upon his children spirits and scarcely anything was said but by himself 
the observation of which with his discontent at whatever the inn afforded and his angry impatience at the waiters made catherine grow every moment more in awe of him and appeared to lengthen the two hours into four 
at last however the order of release was given 
and much was catherine then surprised by the general’s proposal of her taking his place in his son’s cnrricle for the rest of the journey 
the day was one and he was anxious for her seeing as much of the country as possible 
the remembrance of mr allen’s opinion respecting young men’s open carriages made her blush at the mention of such a plan and her first thought was to decline it but her second was of greater deference for general tilney’s judgment he could not propose anything improper for her 
and in the course of a few minutes she found herself with hen in the curricle as happy i being as ever existed 
very short trial convinced her that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world 
the chaise and four whee led off with some grandeur to be sure but it was a heavy and troublesome business and she could not easily forget its having stopped two hours at petty farce 
half the time wo d have been enough for the curricle 
and so simply were the light horses disposed to move that had not the general chosen to have his own carriage lead the way they could have passed it with ease in half a minute 
but the merit of the curricle did not all belong to the horses henry drove so well so quietly without making any disturbance without para rug to her or staring at them 
so different from the only gentleman-coaehman whom it was in her power to northanger scan 
44 compare him with 
and then his hat sat so well and the innumerable capes of his great coat looked so becoming important 
to be driven by him next to being dancing with him was certainly the greatest ha illness in the world 
in addition to every other de right she had now that of listening to her own praise 
of being thanked at least on his sister's account for her kindness in thus becoming her visitor 
of hearing it ranked as real friendship and described as creating real gratimde 
his sister he said was uncomfortable circumstanced 
she had no female companion and in the frequent absence of her father was sometimes without any companion at all 
a but how can that be 
a said catherine 
a are not you with her 
a “northanger is not more than half my home 
i have an establishment at my own house in woodston which is nearly twenty miles from my father and some of my time is necessarily spent there a how sorry you must be for that 
7 a i am always sorry to have eleanor 2 yes 
but besides your affection for her you must be so fond of the abbey 
after being used to such a home as the abbey an ordinary parsonage-house mustbe ve disagreeable 
a e smiled and said a you have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey to be sure i have 
it not it a fine old place just like what one reads about 
a and are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as what one reads about may produce 
have you s stout heart 
nerves it for slidin planets and tapestry e 7 a girl yes i do not think i should be easily frightened because there would be so many people in the home 
and besides it has never been inhabited and 12 45 nonrrrarioiéiz asset 
left deserted for years and then the family come back to it unawares without giving any notice as generally happens.” 7 no certainly 
we shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring members of a wood lire nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows doors or furniture 
but you must be aware that when a young lady is by whatever means introduced into a dwelling of this kind she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family 
while they snugly repair to their own end of the house she is formally conducted by dorothy the ancient housekeeper up a different staircase and along many gloomy passages into an apartment never used since some cousin or in died in it about twenty s before 
can you stand such a ceremony as this 
ill not your mind give you when you and yourself in this gloomy chamber too lofty and extensive for you with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size 
its walls hung wish to my exhibiting guess as large as life and the bed or dark green stuff or put le velvet presenting even a funeral appearance 
ill not your heart sink within you 
7 a oh 
but this will not happen to me i am sure a how fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment 
and what will you discern 
not tables toilettes wardrobes or drawers but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken late on the other a generous chasm which no efforts can open and over the fireplace the permit of some handsome warrior whose features will so incomprehensiny strike you that on will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it 
brother meanwhile no less struck by your appearance gaze on you in great agitation and drops a few unintelligible hints 
to raise your spirits moreover she gives you reason to suppose that the party the abbey you a set ..ame non'rmuczn 1mm r49 inhabit it undoubted haunted and informed you that you will not have a thing e domestic within call 
with this parting cordial the cure of you listen to the sounds of her reception footsteps as long an the lame echo can reach on an when with fainting spirits you attempt to listen your door you discover with increased alarm that it has no lock 
a oh i mr tilney how frightful 
this ll just like a book 
but it can not really ha pen to me 
i m sure your housekeeper in not real y dorothy 
well what then it a nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the hint night 
after amounting your manqueer horror of the bed you will retire to rest and get a few hours unqur'et slumber 
but on the second or at farthest the third night after our arrival you will probably have a violent itorm 
all of under so loud as to seem to shake the advice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountaint 
and during the frightful guns of wind which accompany it you wi lprobably think you dance for your lamp in not extinguished one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest 
rumble of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it you will instantly rise and throwing your dreuing-gown around you proceed to examine this mystery 
after a very short eenrch you will discover a division in the tapestry to artfully constructed at to defy the minute inspection and on opening it a. door will immediately apply which door being only secured by matey burn an a padlock you will after a few eﬁ'oru succeed in opening and with your lamp in your hand will pass through it into a small vaulted room a no indeed 
i illdilld be too much frightened to do my such thing a what 
not when dorothy be given you to under so forth anger abbey 
stand that there is a secret subterranean communication between your a moment and the chapel of st anthony scarcely two s of 
could you shrink from so simple an adventure 
no no 
you will proceed into this small vaulted room and through this into several others without perceiving anything very remarkable in either 
in one perhaps there may he a dagger in another a few drops of blood and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture 
but there being nothing in all this out of the common way and your lamp being nearly exhausted you will return towards your own apartment 
in me 
passing through the small vaulted room however your eyes will be attracted towards a large old-fashioned cant of body and gold which though narrowly examining the furniture before you had passed unnoticed 
impelled by an in'esisu'ble preacntiment you will eagerly advance to it unlocked it folding doors and search into every drawer 
but or sometimes without discovering age of importance perhaps nothing but a considerbonrd of diamonds 
at st however by touching a secret spring an inner compartment will open a roll of paper appears you seize it 
it contains many sweets of manuscript 
you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber but scarcely have you been able to decipher a oh thou whomsoever thou mayst be into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched matilda may fall a when your lamp suddenly expires in the packet and leaves you in total darkness 
a oh no no 
do not say so 
well go on but henry was too much amused by the interest he had raised to be able to carry it farther he could no longer command solemnity either of subject or voice and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancy in the perusal of matilda’s woes 
catherine recollecting herself grew ashamed of her eagerness and began earnestly to assure him that her attention had been fixed without northanger abbey 
is i the smallest ap extension of really meeting with what be related 
a miss tilney she was sure would never put her into such a chamber as he had described 
she was not at all am a as she drew near the end of their journey her impatience a sight of the abbey for some time suspended by his conversation on subjects very different returned in full force and every bend in the road was expected with solemn sum to afford a glimpse of its massy walls of grey stone rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks with the last bars of the sun playing in beautiful splendour on its high gothic windows 
but so low did the building stand that she found herself passing through the great gates of the lodge into the very grounds of northanger without having discerned even an antique chimney 
she knew not that she had any right to be surprized but there was something in this mode of approach which she certainly had not expected 
to pass between lodges of a modern appearance to and herself with such case in the very presents of the abbey and driven so rapidly along a smooth level road of line gravel without obstacle alarm or solemnity of any kind struck her as odd and inconsistent 
she was not long at leisure however for such considerations 
a sudden study of rain driving full in her face made it impossible for her to observe anything further and vexed all her thoughts on the welfare of her new straw bonnet and she was actually under the abbey walls was springing with henry’s assistance from the carriage was beneath the shelter of the old coach and had even passed on to the hall where her friend and the general were waiting to welcome her without feeling one artful foreboding of future to herself or one moment suspicion of any past scenes of horror being used within the solemn ediﬁce 
the breeze had not seemed to walk the sighs x 42 northanger abbey 
of the ordered to her 
it had wanted nothing worse than a thick mizzling rain and having given a good shake to her habit she was ready to be shown into the common drawing-room and capable of considering where she was 
an abbey 
yes it was delightful to be really in an abbey 
but she doubted as she looked round the room whether anything within her observation would have given her the consciousness 
the furniture was in all the profusion and elegance of modern taste 
the fireplace where she had expected the ample wit and pémdemue carving of former times was contracted to a crawford with sobs of plain though handsome marble and ornaments over it of the prettiest english china 
the windows to which she looked with peculiar dependence from having heard the general talk of his preserving them in their notice form with reverential care were yet less what her fancy had portra ed 
to be sure the pointed arch was preserved the arm of them was gothic they might be even engagements but every page was so large so clear so light 
to an imagination which had hoped for the smallest divisions and the heaviest stone work for painted glass dirt and powers the difference was very distressing 
the general perceiving how her eye was employed began to talk of the smallness of the room and simplicity of the furniture where everything being for daily use pretended only to comfort c. flattering himself however that there were some apartments in the abbey not unworthy her notice and was proceeding to mention the cost gilding of one in particular when taking out his watch he stopped short to pronounce it with surprize within twenty minutes of live 
this seemed the word of separation and catherine found herself hurried away by miss tilney in such a manner as convinced her that the strictest 21 
my fortune nanny 
1 5 3 ﬁnctuality to the family hours would be expected at orthanger 
returning through the large and lofty hall they amended a broad m of shining oak which after many might and many landing-places brought them upon a long wide gallery 
on one side it had a image of doors and it was lighted on the other by windows which catherine had only time to discover looked into a quadrangle before miss tilney led the way into a chamber and scarcely staying to hope the would end it comfortable 
left her with an anxious entreaty that the would make no little alteration an possible in her draw 
china 5 
momentary glance wan enough to satisfy catherine that her apartment was very unlike the one which henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the description of 
it war by no means unreasonably large and contained neither tapestry nor velvet the walk were spared the door was completed the windows were neither less perfect nor more dim than than of the drawing-room below 
the furniture though not of the latest fashion was handsome and comfortable and the air of the room altogether far from uncheerful 
her heart instantaneously at case on this point the resolved to lose no time in particular examination of anything a she greatly dreaded obliging the general by an dela 
her habit therefore was thrown off with as possible hate and the wan preparing to upon the linen passage which the chaireaeat had conveyed for her immediate accommodation when her eye uddenly fell on a large high cheat standing back in a deep receu on one side of the fireplace 
l i 44 northanger abbeythe n‘ghtofit made her start 
“dforgetﬁng every thing else she stood gazing on it in motionless wonder while these thoughts crossed her 
this is strange indeed i did not expect such a sight as this 
an immense beuvy chest 
what can it hold 
why should it be placed here 
pushed back too as if meant be out of sight 
i will look into it 
coat what it nut still looking it and directly too 
by daylight 
i my till evening my candle may go out a she advanced and examined it closely 
it wan of cedar curiously inlaid with some darker wood and raised about a foot from the ground on acarved mudofthe same 
the lockwas silver though banished from age 
at each end were the imperfect remains of hands also of silver hmken perhaps prematuer by some strange violence 
and on the centre of the said was a mysterious cipher in the same metal 
catherine bent over it intently him without being able to anything with certain 
she could not in whatever direction she took it be eye the laetletterto be at 
and yctthatit shouldbeanything else in that house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment 
if not originally theirs by what strange events could it have fallen into the tilney family 
her fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater 
and seizing with trembling bands the harp of the lock 
the resolved at all hazards to satisfy herself at last as to its contents 
with difficulty for something seemed to resist her efforts she raised the said a few inches 
but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her starting quit her hold and the said closed with alarming violence 
this illtimed intruder was mist tilney’s maid sent by her mistress to be of use to miss morland 
and though catherine immediately dismissed her it recalled her to northanger abbey 
13 the sense of what she ought to he doing and feared her in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery to proceed in her dressing without further delay 
her progress was not quick for her thou bets and her eyes were still bent on the object so well c called to interest and alarm 
and though she dared not waste a moment upon a second attempt she could not reason many‘eaces from the best at length however having paper one arm into her gown her toilet seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity miss t safely be indulged 
one moment surely might spared 
and so desperate should be the exertion of her strength that unless secured by supernatural means the said in one moment should be thrown back 
with this spirit she sprang forward and her confidence did not recur ve her 
her resolute effort threw back the said and gave to her astonished eyes the view of a white cotton counterpane properly folded reposing at one end of the best 
in undisputed possession 
she was gazing on it with the first blush of so rize when miss tilney anxious for her friends ready entered the room and to the rising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation was then added the shame of being caught in so idle i search 
that is a curious old cheek is not it 
a said miss tilney as catherine hastily closed it and turned away to the glass 
a it is impossible to say how many generations it has been here 
how it came to be first put in this room i know not but i have not had it moved because i thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hat and bonuets 
the worst of it is 
that its weight makes it difficult to open 
in that corner however it is at least out of the way 
catherine had no leisure for speech being at once blushing 
trying her gown and forming vise resolutions 156 uon'rxmozk sunny 
with the most violent dispatch 
miss til till a hinted her fear of being late 
and in half a no down stairs together in an alarm not wholly unfounded or general tilney was pacing the drawing-room his watch in his hand and having on the very instant of their entering pulled the hall with violence ordered 
dinner to be on table rim-lb 
catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke and at pale and breathless in s most humble mood concerned for his children and detecting old chests 
and the general recovering his politeness as he looked at her spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend who was absolutely out of breath from haste when there was not the least occasion for he in the world 
but catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simplewn herself till they were happily seated at the dinner-table when the general’s complaisant smiles and a good appetite of her own restored her to peace 
the dining-parlour we a noble room suitable in its dimen 
donsto a much larger drawing-room than the one in common use and lined up in a style of luxury and ease which was almost lost on the unpmctised eye of catherine who saw little more than its graciousness and the number of their attendants 
on e former she spoke around her admiration 
said the general with a very gracious countenance acknowledged that it was by no name an ill-sized room 
and further confessed that though as careless on such subjects as most people he did look upon a tolerably large sitting-room as one of the neeemries of life 
he sup however that she must have been used to much better sized apartments at mr allen s 
a no indeed a was catherine’s honest assurance 
a mr allen’s dining-parlour was not more than half as northanger abbey 
1 5 7 large 
and she had never seen so large a room as this in her life 
the general’s good-humour increased 
why as he bad such rooms he thought it would be simple not to make use of them 
but upon his honour he believed there might be more comfort in rooms of only half their size 
mr allen’s house he was sure must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness 
the evening passed without any further disturbance and 
in the occasional absence of general tilney with much sir ve cheerfulness 
it was only in his presence t catherine felt the smallest fatigue from her journey 
and even then even in moments of languor or mind a sense of general happiness preponderated and she could think of her friends in bath without one wish of being with them 
the night was stormy 
the wind had been rising at intervals the whole afternoon 
and by the time the party broke up it below and rained violently 
catherine as she crossed the hall listened to the temper with sensations of awe 
and when she heard it rage round a corner of the ancient building and close with sudden in s distant door felt for the first time that she was yet in an abbey 
yes these were characteristic sounds they brought to her recollection a countless variety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes which such buildings had witnessed and such storms ushered in 
and most heartily did she rejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within walls so solemn 
so had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or dnmken gsllsnts 
henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had told her that morning 
in a house so furnished and so guarded she could have nothing to explore or to supper and might go to her bed-mom as securely as if had been her own chamber at fullerton

39 though in a situation conspicuous enough had never change her notice before 
henry’s words the tone of the body cabinet which was to escape her observation at my immediately rushed across her 
and though there could be nothing really in it there was something whimsical it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence 
she took her candle and looked closely at the cabinet 
it was not absolutely boy and gold 
but it was japan black and yellow jargon of the handsomest kind 
and as she held her candle the yellow had very much the object of gold 
the key was in the door and she had strange fancy to look into it 
not however with the smallest expectation of finding anything but it was so very odd after what henry had said 
in short she could not sleep till shehadexaminedir 
smpladngthecandlewith greatcautiononachair seized the keywitha verytrernulons hand and tried to turn it 
hutitrcsisted her utmost strength 
alarmed but not discouraged she tried it another way 
a bold pew and she believed herself successful 
but how strangely mysterious 
the door was still immovable 
she paused a moment in breathless wonder 
the wind roared down the chimney the rain beat in torrents against the windows and everything seemed to speak the fullness of her situation 
to retire to bed however unsatisﬁed on such a point would be vain since sleep must be impossible with the consciousness of s misery so mysteriously closed in her immediate again therefore she applied herself the key said after moving it in e possible way for some insult with the determined ce purity of hopes last eeomlhedoor suddenly to her hand her but seated with adair at such a victory and having thrown open each folding door the second being secured only balls of less wonderful conmwﬁon thanthelock ughinthathcreye could notdiscern 16 northanger abbey 
anything unusual a double range of small drawers apin view with some larger drawers above and below them and in the centre a all door closed also with lock and key secured in all probability a civility of importance 
catherine heart beat quick but her courage did not fail her 
with a cheek washed by hope and an eye mingling with curiosity her anger praised the handle of a drawer and drew it forth 
it was entirely empty 
with lets alarm and greater eagerness she seized a 
second a third 3 fourth 
each was equally empty 
not one was left unaearehed and in not one was anything found 
well read in the art of concealing a creature the possibility of false linings to the drawers did not escape her and she felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain 
the place in the middle alone remained now unexplored 
and though she had a never from the hint had the smallest idea of finding anything any part of the cabinet and wan not in the least disappointed at her ill success thin far it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while she was about it it was some dine however before she could unfam the door the same difﬁculty occurring in the management of this inner lock an of the outer 
but at length it did open 
and not win 1 hitherto was her search 
her quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed back into the further part of the civility apparently for concealment and her feelings at that moment were indescribable 
her heart ﬂuttered her knees trembled and her cheeks grew pale 
she seized with an unsteady hand the precious manuscript for half a glance addicted to ascertain written characters 
and while she acknowledged with awful sensations this striking urempliﬁcntion of what henry had foretold reenlved instantly to persuade every line before she attempted on m

but therewas danger of itssudden extinction it had some hours to burn

alas 
it was suffered and extinguished in one 
a lamp could not have excited with more awful effect

it was done completely 
not a remnant of light in the wicked could give hope to the rekindling brmth 
darkness impenetrable and immovable called the room 
a violent gust of wind rising with sudden fury added fresh honor to the moment 
catherine trembled from head to four 
in the pause which succeeded a sound like reading from 
and the closing of a distant door struck on her a bed ear 
human‘namre could support no more 
a cold sweat stood on her foresee the manuscript fell from her hand and dropping her way to the bed she jumped hastily in and sought some suspension of son by creeping far underneath the clothes 
so close her eyes in sleep that night she felt must be entirely out of the question 
with a curiosity so justly 
awakened and feelings in every way so agitated repose must be absolutely impossible 
the storm too abroad sodreadful 
shehadnotbeenusedtofeelslamﬁ'om wind but now every blast seemed fraught with awful intelligence 
the manuscript so wonderfully found so wonderfully accomplish the morning prediction how was it to be accounted for 
what could it contain 
to whom could it relate 
by what means could it have been so long concealed 
and how singularly strange that it should fall to her in to discover it till she had made herself mistress of its contents however she could have neither repose nor comfort 
and withtbesun s first she was determined to persuade 12 northanger am

the smallest curiosity about it 
this was the only comfort that occurred 
impatient to get rid of those hateful evidence of her folly those detestable papers then scattered over the bed she rose directly 
and falling them up as nearly as possible in the same shape as red returned them to the same spot within the cabinet with a very hearty wish that no untoward accident might ever bring them forward again to disgrace her even with herself 
why the lock should have been so difficult to open however was still something remarkable for she could now manage them with perfect ease 
in this there was surely something mysterious and she indulged in the ﬂattering suggestion for half a minute till the possibility of the doors having been at first unlocked and of being herself its fastener darted into her head and cost her another blush 
she got away as soon as she could from a room in which her conduct produced such unpleasant reflection and found her way with all speed to the breakfastlour as it had been pointed out to her by miss lucy the evening before 
henry was alone in it 
and his immediate hope of her having been undisturbed by the temper with an arch reference to the character of the building they inhabited was rather distressing 
for the world would she not have her weakness suspected 
and yet unequal to an absolute falsehood 
was constrained to acknowledge that the wind had kept her awake a little

the mere habit of learning to love is the thing 
and a desirableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing 
has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction 
a catherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the entrance of the general whose smiling compliments announced a happy use of mind but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not advance her composure 
the elegance of the breakfast-set forced itself on catherine’s notice when they were seated at table 
and luckily it had been the general’s choke 
he was enchanted by her approbation of his tale confirmed it to be neat and simple thought it right to encourage themanuﬁcmreofhiscounttyaandforhispart to his uncritical the tea was as well ﬂavoured from theclayof taffordshireasfromthatofdmdenor ill of northanger annoy

but this was wise an old setpurchased two year-ago

he trusted however that an opportunity might ere long occur of selecting one though not for himtdf.” catherine was probably the only one of the party who did not understand him 
shortly after breakfast henry left them for woodston where business required and would keep him two orthreedays

a and when they had gone over the home he promised himself more 
over the secure of accompanying her into the climbheriel an garden.” she cried her acquiescence 
but perhaps it might be more agreeable to her to make those her first object 
the weather was at present favourable and at thin time of year the uncertainty was very great of its continuing to 
which would she prefer 
he was equally at her service 
which did his daughter think would most accord with her fair friend wiehel

but when did she jumped amine 
the would he any of and dry

he left the room and catherine with a anxious face began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his own inclination under a mistaken idea of pleasing her 
but she was stop by miss tilney’s saying with a little confrmion “ibelieveitwillbewrsestto takethe morning while it is some 
and do not be uneasy on my mother's account he always walks out at thin time of days catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood 
why was miss tilney embarrassed 
could there be any unwillingness on the general’s side to show her over the abbey 
the proof was his own 
and was it not odd that he she always take his walk so early 
neither her father nor mr allen did so 
it was certainly very provoking 
she was all impatience to see the house and had merely any curiosity about the grounds 
if henry had been with them indeed 
but now she should not know what was picturesque when she saw it 
such were her thoughts 
but she kept them to herself and put on her bonnet in patient discontent she was struck however beyond her expectation by the grandeur of the abbey as she saw it for the first time from the lawn 
the whole building enclosed a large court 
and two sides of the quadrangle rich in this ornaments stood forward for admiration 
the remainder was shut off by roll of old trees or luxuriant plantations and the steep woody hills rising behind to give it shelter were beauties even in the clearness month of march 
catherine had seen nothing to compare with it 
and her feelings of delight were so strong 
that without waiting for any better authority she boldly bum ford in wonder and praise 
the general listened with assentin gratitude and it seemed as if his own estimation of danger had waited unﬁxed all that hour

the number of acnea contained in this garden was such as catherine could not listen no without dismay being more than double the extent of all mr allen’s an well as her father including churchyard and orchard 
the walls accrued countless in number endless in length 
a village of hot-home seemed to smile among them and a whole partial to be at work within the enclosure 
the general was ﬂamered by her look of ride which told him almottaeplainly a he soon for her to tell him in words that the had neverseen anygardensat all equal to them before 
and then modestly owned that without any ambition of that sort himself without any solicitude about it he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom

mr allen had only one mall hot-home which mr allen had the use offer her plan in winter and there wan a are in it now and there is northanger abbey

a said the general with a look of very happy contempt having taken her into every division and led her under every wall till she was heartily weary of seeing a and wondering he suffered the girls at last to seize the advantage of an outer door and then expressing his wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about the tea-house put it as no unpleasant extension of their walk if miss morland were not tired 
a but where are you going eleanor 
why do you chose that cold damp path to it 
miss morland will wet 
our best way is across the par 5 this is so favourite a walk of mine a said miss tilney that i always think it the best and nearest way 
but perhaps it may he damp.” t was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old scotch ﬁrs 
and catherine struck by its gloomy aspect and eager to enter it could not even by the general’s disapprobation be kept from stepping forward 
he perceived her inclination and having again urged the plea of health in vain was too polite to make further opposition 
he excused himself however from attending in 6 the rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him and he would meet them by another course he turned away 
and catherine was shocked to and how much her spirits were relieved by the separation 
the shock however being less real than the relief offered it no injury 
and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired 
a i am particularly fond of this a said her companion with a sigh 
it was my mother's favourite walk catherine had never heard mrs tilney mentioned in the family before 
and the interest excited by this tender remembrance shewed itself directly in her altered as northanger abbey

the general certainly had been an unkind hudmrd 
he did not love her walk 
could he therefore have loved her

and besides handsome as he was there was a something in the turn of his fame which spoke his not having behaved well to her

a portrait very like of a departed wife not used by her husband 
he must have been dreadfully came to her 
catherine after ted no longer to hide horn herself the nature of the songs which in spite of all his attentions he had previously excited 
and what had been terror and dislike before was now absolute aversion 
yes aversion 
his cruel to such a charming woman made him odious to her 
he had often read of such characters 
characters which mr allen had been used to call unnatural and overdnwn 
but here was proof positive of the contrary 
she had settled this point when the end of the path brought them directly upon the general 
and in spite of all her virtuous indignation she found herself again obliged to walk with him listen to him and even to smile when he smiled 
being no longer able however to receive pleasure from the surrounding objects the soon began to walk with lassitude the general perceived it and with a concern for her health which seemed so reproach her for her opinion of him was most urgent for returning with his daughter the house 
he would follow them in a quarter of an hour 
again they parted 
but eleanor was called back half minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend horn{ anger abbey 
it 
round the abbey till his return 
this second instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck catherine as very remarkable 
emma still 
a hour passed away before the general came in 
t on the part of his young guest in no very vounhle consideration of his character 
a this lengthened absence these solitary rambles did not sped a mind at ease or a conscience void of reproach at length he appeared 
and whatever might have been the me of his meditations he could still smile with 15m

and her father being contrary to catherine’s expectations unprovided with any pretence for further delay beyond that of stopping five minutes to order refreshments to be intheroombytheirretum was last rendyto escort them 
they set forward 
and with a grandeur of air a digniﬁed step which caught the eye but could not shake the doubts of the well-bred catherine he led the way across the hall through the common drawing-room and one useless ante-chamber into a room magniﬁcent both in size and furniture the real drawing-room used only with company of consequence 
it was very noble very grand very charming was all that catherine had to say for her indiscriminsn'ng eye scarcely discerned the colour of the mind 
and 41 minuteness of guise all praise that had much meaning was nipped by the general the costlinen or elegance of any room’n_ﬁtting up could be nothiugtqher 
she cared for no furniture of more l 44 northanger abbey 
modern date than the'ﬁfnemth century 
when the generalhadntisﬁedhilown curiosity inaclose examination of every well-known ornament they proceeded to the library an apartment in it way ofequal magniﬁcence exhibsu'ng a collection of books on which an humble man might have looked with catherine heard admired and wondered with more genuine feeling than before gathered all that she could from this storehouse of knowledge by running over the title of half shelf was ready to proceed 
but states of apartments did not spring up with her wishes 
large as was the building she had already visited the part 
though on being told that with the addition of thekitehen thesixorseven room she had now seat surrounded three sides of the court she could scarcely believe it or overcome the suspicion of there being many chambers secreted 
it was some relief however that they were to return to the rooms in common use by passing through a few of less importance looking him the court which with occasional passages not wholly unintricate connected the different sides 
and she was farther soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading what had once been a sister having traces of cells pointed out and observing several doors that were neither opened nor explained to her 
by finding herself successively in a billiard-room and in the general’s private apartment without comprehending their connexion or being able to turn aright when she left them 
and lastly by passing through a dark little room owning henry’s authority and screwed with his litter of books guns and great-coats 
from the dining-room of which though already seen and always to be seen at five o'clock the general could not forego the pleasure of pacing out the length for the more certain information of allies morland as what she neither doubted nor cared for they pronorthanger abbey 
i 44 cheered by quick communication to the kitchen 
the ancient kitchen of the concert rich in the many walls and spoke of former days and in the gloves and hot close of the present 
he genenl’e improving hand had not scattered here 
every modern invention to facilitate the labour of the cooks had been within thin their spacious theatre 
and when the general of other had failed his own had often produced the perfection wanted 
his enjoyment of this spot alone might at any time have placed him high among the benefactor of the concert 
with the walls of the kitchen ended all the activity of the abbey 
the fourth side of thequadrangle having on account of its decaying state been removed by the general’s father and the present expected in its place 
all that was venerable ceased here 
the new building was not only new but declared itself to be no 
intended only for offices and enclosed behind by stable-yards no uniformity of architecture had been thought neoeenry 
catherine could have raved at the hand which had swept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest for the purposes of mere domestic economy 
and would willingly have been spared the mortification of a walk through ioenee no fallen had the general allowed it but if he had a vanity it was in the arrangement of his office 
and as he was convinced that 
to a mind like miss morland’s a view of the accommodations and comforts by which the labour of her inferior were softened must always be sanitizing he should make no apology for leading her on 
hey took a slight survey of all 
and catherine was impressed beyond her expectation by their multiplicity and their convenience 
he purpose for which a few thapelen parties and a comfortable icullery were deemed sufﬁcient at fullerton were here carried on in appropriate diviaionl commodious and roomy 
the number of servants continually 24 northanger am

they so get through it all had often amazed mrs allen 
and when catherine saw what was necessary here she began to be amazed herself 
they returned to the hall that the chief ctain‘aae might be ascended and the beauty of its wood and moments of rich carving might be pointed out having gained the top they turned in an opposite direction m the gallery in which her room lay and shortly entered one on the lame plan but superior in length and bath 
she was here shewn eucceasively into three large bed-chambers with their dressing-rooms most completely and handsomely fitted up everything that money and taste could do to give comfort and elegance to apartments had been bestowed on these 
and being furnished within the last five years they were perfect in all that would be generally pleasing and wanting in all that could give pleasure to catherine 
as they were surveying the last the general after slightly naming a few of the distinguished characters by whom they had at times been honoured turned with a smiling countenance to catherine and ventured to hope that henceforward some of the earliest tenants might be a our friend from fullerton she felt the trout ted compliment and deeply regretted the impossibility 
of thinking well of a man so kindly do towards herself and so hall of civility to all her family 
the gallery was terminated by folding doors which north le abbey

and what was there more to he seen 
had not miss morland already seen all that could be worth her notice 
and did she not up her friend might be glad of some refreshment s so much exercise 
miss tilney drew hack directly and the heavy doors were closed upon the married catherine who having seen in a momentary glance beyond them a narrower passage more numerous opening and symptoms of a windin staircase believed herself at last within the reach of something worth her notice 
and felt as she unwillingly paced hack the gallery that she would rather he allowed to examine that end of the house than see all the misery of all the rest 
the general s evident desire of preventing such an examination was an additional stimulant 
something was certainly to be concealed her fancy though it had trespassed lately once or twice could not mislead her here 
and what that something was a short sentence of miss tilney’s as they followed the general at some distance down stairs seemed to point out 
a i was going to miss you into what was my mother s room the room in which she died 
were all her words 
but few as they were they conveyed pages of intelligence to catherine 
it was no wonder that the general should shrink from the sight of such object a that room must contain 
a room in all ymlnbility never entered by him since the dreadful scene had which repeated his suffering wife and left him to the sting of conscience 
she secured when next alone with eleanor to express her wishofheing permitted to seek a wellasall 48 northanger abbey

a yes entirely 
and how long ago may be that your mother died pay a “shehasbeendmd these nine years 
and nine years catherine knew was a trifle of time compared with what generally elapsed after the death of an injured wife before her room was put to rights 
you were with her i suppose to the last 
a not a said miss tilney sighing 
i was unfortunately from home 
her illness was sudden and short 
and before i arrived it was all over catherine’s blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions which naturally sprang from these words

it was the air and attitude of a nlontoni

unhappy man 
and the anxiousnesa of her spirits directed her eyes towards his figure so repeatedly as to catch miss tilney’s notice 
a my father she whispered 
often walks about the room in this way 
it is nothing unusual 
a so much the worse 
thought catherine such ill-timed exercise was of a piece with the strange unnorthanger abbey 
l 19 smallness of his morning walls and bowed nothing after an during the little variety and seeing length of which made her peculiarly ierm'ble of henry’s impomnoe among them was heartily ladto be dismissed 
though it was a look from the general not designed for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell 
when the butler would have lit his master andle however he was forbidden 
the latter was not going to retire i have many pamphlets to finish aid he to catherine 1 before i can close my eyes

to be up hours after the army were in bed by rapid pamphlm we not very likely 
there must be some deeper came something was to be done which could be done only while the household slept 
and the probability that mr tilney yet lived shut up for causes unknown and receiving from the pitiless hands of her husband a mighty supply of coarse food was the conclusion which necessarily followed 
shocking as was the idea it war at least hemrthanadeath nufairlyhastened a in the natural course of things she must ere long be released 
the suddenness of her reputed illness the sense of her daughter and probably of her other children at the time all favoured the supposition of her imprisonment

of monastic division 
in the high-arched pause passed with stone which already the had trodden with peculiar awe the well remembered the door of which the general had given no account 
to what might not these door 
lead 
in support of the possibility of this conjecture it further occurred to her that the forbidden gallery in which lay the apartments of the unfortunate man tilney must he an certainly at her memory could guide her exactly over thin w rangeofcelle 
and the staircase the tide of those apartment 
of which the had caught a trantient glimpse communicating by name secret meanwith those cells might well have favoured the barbaroue proceedings of her husband

but they were supported by such appearances as made their dismissal in the tide of the quadrangle in which the supposed the guilty scene to be acting being according her he 
lief opposite her own it struck her that if judicioualy watched some lay of light from the geneml’a lamp might glimmer through the lower windows ii he passed to the priory of his wife 
and twice before she stepped into bed she stole gently from her room to the correlponding window in the gallery to see if it appeared but all abroad was dark and it most yet he too early 
the various ascending noises convinced her that the tenants mun m ll be up

bustle when the clock had struck twelve and all was quiet she would if not quite appeased by darkness nee 
out and look once more 
the clock struck twelve and catherine had been half an hour asleep 
they ﬁﬁl‘ﬁ‘ 
he next day afforded no opportunity for the proposed examination of the mysterious apartment 
it viii sunday and the whole time between morning and afternoon service was required by the general in exercise abroad or eating cold meat at home 
and great as was catherine’s curiosity her courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner either by the finding light of the sky between six and even of clock or by the yet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp 
the day no unmarked therefore by anything to interest her imagination beyond the sight of a very elegant consent to the memory of mrs tilney which immediate from the family pew 
by that her eye was in my caught and long retained 
and the perusal of the highly-strained epitaph in which every virtue was described to henry the inconsolable husband who must have been in come w or other her destroyer affected her even to tears 
hat the general having expected such a moment should be able to face it was not perhaps very range and yet that he could lit to boldly collected within it view maintain i0 elevated an air look no female around nay that he should even enter the church ieerned wonderful to catherine 
not however that many income of being equally hardened in guilt might not be produced 
she could remember dozen182 northanger abbey 
who hadpersevered ineverypossiblevice going from crime to crime murdering whomsoever they chose without any feeling of humanity or remorse till a violent death or s relations retirement closed their black career 
the erection of the moment myself could not in the smallest de affect her doubts of mrs tilney’s acmal deoease 
ere she even to descend into the family vault where her shoes were supposed to slumber were she to behold the cousin in which they were said to be released what could it avail in such a case 
catherine had read too much not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a warmer ﬁgure might be introduced and a supposititious funeral carried on 
the succeeding mnming promised something better 
the general’s early walk ill-timed as it was in every other view was favourable here 
and when she knew him to be out of the house she directly proposed to miss tilney the accomplishment of her promise 
eleanorwas ready to oblige her 
and catherine reminding her as they went of another promise their first visit in consequence was to the traits in her bed-chamber 
it represented a very law my woman with a mild and pensive cormtenance justifying so far the expectations of its new observer 
but they were not in every respect answered for catherine had depended upon meeting with fears sir complexion that should he the very counterpart the very image if not of henry’s of eleanor’s 
the only miss of which she had been in the habit of thinking no always an equal resemblance of mother and child 
a face once taken was taken for generations 
but here she was obliged to look and consider and study for a likeness 
she contemplated it however in to of this drawback with much emotion 
and put r s yet stronger interest would have left it unwillingly 
her agitation as they entered the great gallery was northanger abbey 
8 too great fear any endeavour at diuccume 
she could only look at her companion 
eleanor-’9 countenance wudejected yet-edate 
audit compouureepoke her inured to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing 
again the passed through the folding-doors again her hand was than the important lock and catherine hardly able to breathe wan turning to close the former with fears caution when the cure the dreaded figure of the general himself at the further end of the gallery stood before her 
the name of “elmoor” at the me moment in hill loudest tone resounded through the building giving to his daughter the ears intimation of his presence and to catherine tenor upon tenor 
an attempt at concealment had been her we inlinctive movement on perceiving him yet the could safely hope to have escaped his eye 
and when her friend who with an apologizing look darted hastily by her had joined and disappeared with him she ran for to her own room made loching herself in believed that she should never have courage to go down again 
she remained there at least an hour in the agitation deeply cornmiaerating the rule of her poor friend and expecting a summon herself from the angry general to attend him in hit own apartment 
no immune however arrived 
and at in on seeing a carriage drive up to the abbey she wan emboldened to descend and meet him under the protection of visiting the hreakfart-mom was gay with company 
and the wunamedtothembythegeneraluthe giendof his daughter in a complimentary style which to well conoealedhia relentfnl are a to make her feel secure at sea 
of life for the present 
and eleanor with a command of countenance which did honour to her concern for his character taking an early occasion of saying to her a my father only wanted me to answer a note ahebegan hope that head either been uneeenhy 1810 northanger abbey 
the general or that from some consideration of lucy she should be allowed to suppose herself so 
upon this trust she dared still to remain in his presence after the company left them and nothing occurred to disturb it 
in the course of this moment's reflection she came so a resolution of making her next attempt on the forbidden door alone 
it would be much better in every respect that eleanor should know nothing of the matter 
to involve her in the danger of a second detection to court her into an apartment which must bring her hurt could not be the notice of a friend 
the general’s utmost anger could not be to herself what it might be to a daughter and besides she 
thought the examination itself would be more satisfactory if made without any companion 
it would be impossible to explain to eleanor the suspicious from which the other had in all likelihood been hitherto happily exempt 
nor could she therefore in bar resence search ﬁir those proofs of the general’s me say which however they might yet have escaped discovery she felt contents of somewhere drawing or in the shape of some fragmented journal continued to the last gasp 
of the way to the apartment she was now perfectly mistress and as she wished to get it over before henry’s return who was six on the morrow there was no time so be lost 
the day was bright her courage high 
at forno’cloclt the sun was now two hours about the horizon and it would be only her retiring to dress half an hour earlier than usual 
it was done 
and catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the clock had ceased to strike 
it was no time for thought she hurried on slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors and without stopping to look or breathe rushed forward to the one in question 
the look yielded to her hand and northanger abbey 
18 5 luckin with no sullen sound that could alarm a human being 
on tiptoe the entered the room was before her but it was some minutes before she could advance another step 
she beheld what vexed her to the spot 
and agitated every future 
she saw a large well-proportioned apartment an handsome dimity bed arranged as occupied with an housemaid’t care a bright bath stove mahogany wardrobe and neatly-painted chain on which the warm bars of a western sun gaily poured through two sath windows 
catherine had expected to have her feelings worked and worked they were 
punishment and doubt first teiled them and a short mooeeding day of common sense added some bitter emotions of shame 
she could not be mistaken as to the room 
but how grossly mistaken in everything else in miss tilney’s meaning in her own calculation 
this apartment to which the had given a date so ancient 
a in so awful proved to be one end of what the eral’s father had built 
there were two other doors in the chamber leading pmhablyinto dressing-clooeu but the had no inclination to open either 
would the evil in which mrs tilney had last walked or the volume in which the had it read remain to tell what nothing else was allowed to whisper 
no 
whatever might have been the general s crimes he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for detection 
she was sick of exploring and desired but to be safe in her own room with her own heart only privy to its folly and the was on the point of retreau'ng as softly as she had entered when the sound of footsteps she could hardly tell where made her pause and tremble 
to be found there even by a servant would he unpleasant but by the general and he seemed always at hand when last wanted much worse 
she listened the sound had ceased and resolving not to lose a moment the passed through and closed the door 
at that invent a 28 northanger abbey

did not afford

and you are not now in bath 
no that no room to prepare for

she lent you to look at it i suppose 
7 a no 
a it ha been your own doing entirely 
a catherine 188 northanger abbey 
said nothing 
after a short silence during which he had closely preserved her he added a as there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother s character as described by eleanor which does honour to her memory 
the world i believe never saw a better woman 
but it it not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this 
the domestic unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours 
eleanor i suppose has talked ofher agreatdesl 2 2 yes a great deal 
that is 
no not much but what she did my was very interesting 
her dying so suddenly 1 slowly and with hesitation it was spoken a and you 
none of you being at home 
and your father i thought perhaps had not been very fond of her a and from these circumstances he replied his quick eye fixed on hers 
a you infer the probability of some negligence

a very respectable man and one in whom she had always i placed great confidence 
upon his opinion of her change two others were called in the next day and remained in almost constant attendance for four-and-twenty hours 
on the fifth day she died 
during the progress of her disorder frederick and i we were both at home saw her repeatedly 
and from our own observation can bear wishes to her having received northanger abbey 
189 every possible attention which could spring from the selection of those about her or which her situation in life could command

he loved her i am waded as well an it w possible for him to e have not all you know the name tenderness of disposition 
and i will not pretend to say that while the lived the might not often have had much to bear 
but though his turn r injured her his judgment never did his value her was sincere 
and if not permanently he was truly affected by her death

than tiff 
he visions of romance were over 
catherine was completely awakened 
henry’s address short as it had been had more thoroughly opened her eyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several disappointments had done 
most grievously was she humbled 
most bitterly did the cry 
it was not only with herself that shewas sunk but with henry 
her folly which now seemed even criminal 
was all exposed to him 
and he must despise her for ever 
the liberty which her imagination had dared to take with the character of his father could he ever forgive it 
the absurdity of her curiosity and her fears could they ever be forgotten 
she hated herself more than she could express 
he had in thought he had once or twice before this fatal morning she something like affection for her 
but now 
in short she made herself as miserable as a e for about half an hour went down when the c ock muck ﬁve with a broken heart and could scarcely give an intelligible answer to elinor in sir if she was well 
the formidable hen soon for owed her into the room and the only i presence in his behaviour to her was that he paid her rather more attention than usual 
catherine had never wanted comfort more and he looked as if he was aware of it 
the evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness 
and her spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity 
she did not learn either to forget or defend the past 
but she learned to hope that it would never transpire farther and that it might not cost her henry s entire regard

than that it had been all a volume self-created deluaian each triﬂing circumstance receiving importance from an imagination relolved an alarm and everything forced to bend to one p1 one by a mind which before she entered the abbey been craving to be frightened 
she remembered with what feelings she had prepared for a knowledge of northanger 
she saw that the infatuation had been created the mischief aettled long before her quitting bath and it seemed an if the whole might be traced to the insolence of that can of reading which the had there indulged

among the england the believed in their ham and able there was a general though unequal mixture of good and bad 
upon thin conviction the would not be surprized if even in henry and eleanor til come alight imperfection might hereafter appear 
am 19 northanger abbey 
this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual packs in the character of their father who though cleared from the grossly injurious suspicions which the must ever blush to have entertained she did believe upon serious consideration to be not perfectly amiable 
her mind made on these several point and her resolution formed i 
always judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense she had nothing to do but to forgive herself and be his her than ever 
and the sentiment hand of time did much or her by insensible gradations in the course of another day 
henry’s astonishing generosity and nobleness of conduct in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed was of the greatest assistance to her 
and sooner than she could have supposed it possible in the beginning of her distress her spirits became absolutely comfortable and capable as heretofore of continual improvement by anything he said 
there were still some subjects indeed under which she believed they must always tremble 
the mention of a check or a cabinet for instance and she did not love the sight of james in any 
shape but even 5 could allow that an occasional memento of past folly however painful 
might not be without use 
the anxieties of common life began soon to seemed to the alarms of romance 
her desire of hearing from label 
grew every day greater 
she was quite impatient to know how the bath world went on and how the rooms were amended 
and especially was she anxious to be assured of isabella’s having matched some one netting cotton on which she had left her intent 
and of her continuing on the best terms with james 
her only dependence for information of any kind was on isabella 
james had protested against writing to her till his return to of 
and mr allen hadgtven hernolmpcsofalettertilllhehadgotbackto 
northanger abbey 
19 fullerton 
but isabella had promised and promised again 
andwhenshepromisedathing she so scrupulous in performing it 
this made it so particularly strange 
for nine succest mornings catherine wondered over the repetition of s disappointment which each morning became more severe 
but on the tenth when she entered the breakfast 
room her first object was s letter held out by henry’s willing hand 
she thanked him as heart as if he had written it himself 
a t is only from james however a no she looked at the direction 
she opened it it was from oxford 
and so this purpose 
“dns currants 
though god knows with little inclination for writing i think it my duty to sell you that everything is st an end between miss thorpe and me 
i left her and bath yenrday never so see either again 
i shall not enter into particulars they would only pain you more 
you will soon hear enough from another manner on know where lies the blame 
and i hope was l acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned 
thank god 
i am deceived in time 
but it is a he blow 
after my father consent had been so in my hen 
but no more of this 
she has made me miserable e for ever 
let me soon hear from you dear catherine 
you are my only friend 
per love i do build upon 
i wish your visit it northanger may be over before captain tilney makes his engagement known or you will be uncomfortable circumstanced

laughed at my fears 
i am ashamed to think how long iborewithit 
but ifeverman reason to believe himself loved i was that man 
i must understand even now what she would be at for there could he no need of my being played at 
no make her secure of tilney 
we parted at last by mutual consent 
happy for me had we never met 
i can never expect to know such another woman i dearest catherine aware how you give your hem 
believe me etc.” catherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of countenance and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder declared her to be receiving unpleasant news 
and henry earnestly watching her through the whole letter uw plainly that it ended no better than it began 
he was prevented however from even looking his mrprize by his father entrance they went to breakfast directly 
but catherine could hardly eat anything 
tea called her and even in down her cheeks as she eat 
the letter waaone momentinher hand then in her lap and then in her pocket 
and she looked as if she knew not whatshe did 
the general between his social and his newspaper had luckily no leisure for noticing her 
but to the other two her dim-es wan equally visible as soon as she dared leave the table she hurried away to her own room 
but the housemaids were buy in it and the war obliged to come down again 
she turned into the drawing-room for privacy but henry and eleanor had likewise retreated thither and were at that moment d in consultation about her 
she drew back trying to g their pardon but was with gentle violence forced to return 
and the then withdrew after eleanor had affectionately expressed a with of being of me or comfort 
to her 
after half an hour’free indulgence of grief and norwgir um 
35 reﬂecu'on catherine felt equal to encounter her friends 
but whether she should make her dimers known to them was another consideration 
perhaps if earned the might just give an idea just dimntly hint at it 
but not more 
not expose a friend such a friend as isabella hadbeento her 
and then their own brother 30 deeply concerned in it 
she believed the man wave the subject altogether 
henry and eleanor were by themselves in the breakfast room

and having expressed also her concern and surprize began to inquire into miss thorpe connexionand fortune 
her mother is a very good sort of woman a wan catherine’s answer 
a what was her father 
a 7 a lawyer i believe 
they live at putney.” a are they a wealthy family 2 
no not very 
i do not believe isabella hat any fortune at all 
but that will not signify in your family 
your father ll no very liberal 
he told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the of hit children the brother and sister looked at each other 
a but a rapid eleanor after a short pause could it be to promote his happiness to enable him to marry inch 3 girl 
she must be an unprincipled one or the could not have need your brother in 
and how mange an infatuation on frederick’l ride 
a who before his eyes it visiting an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man 
is not it inconceivable henry 2 frederick too who always wore his heart no mudlyl who found no wound good enough to be in a that in the meet unpmmiﬁng circumstance the manners presumption against him 
when i think of his plan declarationa i give him up 
moreover i have too good an opinion of mill thorpe’e prudence to suppose that the would part with one gentleman before the other was secured 
it it all over with frederick indeed 
he in i deceased man 
defect in understanding 
prepare for your sister-in-law eleanor 
and such i liner-in-iaw us you must delight in 
open candid mien guilelen with affections strong but 48 northanger abbey 
simple forming no pretensions and knowing no disguise such a sister-in-law henry i should delight in a said eleanor with a smile 
but perhaps a observed catherine though she has behaved so ill by our family she may behave better by yours 
now she has really got the man she likes she may be constant a indeed i am afraid she will replied henry 
a i am afraid she will be very constant unless a baronet should come in her way 
that is frederick’s only chance 
i will get the bath paper and look over the arrivals 3 you think it is all for ambition then 
and upon my word there are some things that seem very like it 
i can not forget that when she first knew what my father would do for them she seemed quite disappointed that 
it was not more 
i never was so deceived in any one character in my life before 
among all the great variety that you have known and studied 
a my own disappointment and loss in her is very get 
but as for poor james i suppose he will hardly ever recover is your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present 
but we must not in our concern for his sufferings made us yours 
you feel i suppose that in losing i la you lose half yourself you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy 
society is becoming irksome 
and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at bath the very idea of them without her is abhorrent 
you would not for instance now go to a ball for the world 
you feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve 
on whose regard you can place dependence 
or whose counsel in any difficulty you could rely on 
you feel all this 
northanger abbey 
19 into a said catherine after a few moments reflection i doubt ought i 
to by the truth though i am hurt and grieved that i can not will love her that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again i do not feel so very very much affected 3 one would have thought you feel as you always do was m is most to the credit of human nature 
such feelings ought to he inveetigated that they may know themselves.” catherine by some chance or other found her spirits so very much relieved by thin conversation that she could not regret her being led on though i unaccounuhly to mention the circumstance which had produced it 
hum £5173 
from this time the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young people 
and catherine found with some surprize that her two young friends were perfectly agreed in considering itahella’l want of consequence and fortune as likely to throw great diﬂiculu'es in the way of her marrying theirbrother 
their persuaded that the general would upon this ground alone independent of the objection that might be raised against her character oppose the connexion turned her feeling 
moreover with some alarm towards herself 
she was at insigniﬁcant and perhaps ii portionleu as isabella 
and if the heir of the gallery property had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself at what point of interest were the demands of his younger brother to rest 
the very relations to which this thought led could only he by a dependence on the effect of that part partiality 
which an the was given to understand by his words as well as his actions 200 northanger abbey 
she had from the first been so fortunate as to excite in the general 
and by a recollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the subject of money which she had more than once heard him utter and which tempted her to think his disposition in such matters misunderstood by his children 
they were so fully convinced however that their brother would not have the courage to 1 play in person or his father consent and so repea assured her that be had never in his life been less likely to come to northanger than at the present time that she suffered her mind to be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of her own 
but as it was not to be supposed that captain tilney whenever he made his application would give his father any idea of isabella s conduct it occurred to her as highly expedient that henry should lay the whole business before him as it really was enabling the general by that means to form a cool and impartial opinion and pay his objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations 
she proposed it to him accordingly 
but he did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she had expected 
a no a said he 
my father hands need not be strengthened and frederick confession of folly need not be forestalled 
he must tell his own story 
a but he will tell only half is a quarter would be enough 
a day or two passed away and brought no tidings of captain tilney 
his brother and sister knew not what to think 
sometimes it appeared to them as if his silence would be the natural result of the suspected engagement and at others that it was wholly incom table with it 
the general mean while though i did every morning by frederick’s remilsneu in writing was free from any real anxiety about him 
and had no more pressing solicimde than that of making miss morland’s .-‘

every day s society and employment would disgust her with the place wished the lady frauen had been in the country talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancing people in the neighbourhood 
but then it was such a dead time of year no wild-fowl no game and the lady frauen were not in the country anditallended last in his telling henry one morning that when he next went 
to woman they would take him by surprize there some day or other and eat their mutton with him 
henry wan greatly honoured and very happy and catherine wan quite delighted with the scheme 
and when do you think air i may look forward to this pleasure 
i must be at woman on monday to attend the meet and shall probably be obliged to my two or three a well well we will take our chance some one other day 
thereienoneedto ﬁx 
you are not to put yourself at all out of your way 
whatever may happen to have in the house be enough 
think i can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor table 
let me see 
monday will be a busy day with you 
we will not come on monday 
and tuesday will be 1 buy one with me 
i expect my lurveyor from wickham with his report in the morning 
and afterwards i can not in decency fail attending the club 
i really could not face my acquaintance if i mind away now 
for an i am known to be in the country it would be taken exceedingly amine 
and it is 1 rule with me miss morland never to give offence to any of my neighbour 
if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it 
they are a net of very worthy men 
they have half a brick from northanger twice a or not northanger abbey 
year 
and i dine with them whenever i can 
tuesday therefore we my my is out of the question 
but on wednesday i think henry you may expect us 
and we shall be with you early that we may have arm to look about us 
two hours and three-quarters will carry to woman i suppose 
we shall be in the carriage by ten 
so about a quarter before one on wednesday you may look for us a ball itself could not have been more welcome to catherine than this little excursion so strong was her desire to be as united with woodman 
and her heart was still bonn g with joy when henry about an hour afterwards came boot and great-coated into the more where she and eleanor were sitting and said i am come young ladies in a very moralizing strain to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage giving ready-monied actual ha 
new for a draws on the future that may not be honoured witness myself at this present hour 
because i am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at woman on wednesday which bad weather or twenty other causes may prevent i must go away directly two days before i intended it go away a said catherine with a very long face 1 and why 
7 a why 
how can you ask the question 
because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wit because i must go and prepare a dinner for you to be sure “0h 
not seriously 
a ay and sadly too 
for i had much rather say a but how can you think of such a thing after what the general said 
when he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble e because myrbing would do 
northanger abbey 
23 henry only smiled 
i am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister's account and mine 
you must know it to be so 
and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary 
besides if he had not said half so much as he did he has always much an excellent dinner at home that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify 
a i i wish i could reason like you for his sake and my own 
good-bye 
as to-morrow is sunday eleanor i shall not return he went 
and it being at any time a much simple relations to catherine to doubt her own judgment than enry’s she was very soon obliged to give him credit for being right however disagreeable to her his going 
but the inexplicability of the general’s conduct dwelt much on her thoughts 
that he was very particular in his eating she had by her own unassisted observation already discovered 
but why he should so one thing no positively and mean another all the w e was most unaccountable 
how were people at that rate to be understood 
who but henry could have been aware of what his father was at 
from saturday to wednesday however they were now to be without hen 
this was the sad name of every reflection 
and spring tilney’s letter would certainly come in his absence and wednesday she was verysure would bewel the st present and future were all equally in gloom 
her brother so unhappy and her loss in isabella so 
and eleanor spirits always affected by henry a absence 
what was there to interest or amuse her 
she was tired of the woods and the shrubberies always so smooth and so dry 
and the abbey in itself was no more to her now than any other house 
the painful remembrance of the folly it had helped to yours and perfect was the only emotion which could spring from s consideration 20 northanger abbey 
of the building 
what a revolution in her ideas 
she who had so longed to he in in abbey 
now there was nothing so charming to her imagination as the unpretending comfort of a well-connected parsonage something like fullerton but better 
fullerton had its faults but woodston probably had none 
if wednmday should ever come 
it did come and exactly when it might be reasonably looked for 
it came 
it was one and catherine trod on air 
b ten o'clock the chaise-and-ibur conedthetwo mother and after e drive of almost twenty mdpégthey entered wmoodston a large and populous village in i situation not unpleasant catherine was ashamed to say how pretty shethoughtigathegeneralseernedwthinkan apology necessary for the names of the country and the size of thevillage 
but in her heartshe preferred to anypgce she had ever beeoagand looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage and at all the little chandler’s shops which they embed 
at the further end of the village and were by disengaged from the rest of it stood the parsonage a new-built substantial stone house with its semi-circular my and green gates 
and as they drove up to the door henry with the friends of his solitude a large newfoundland happy and two or three tempers was ready to receive and make much of them 
catherine’s mind was too full as the entered the house for her either to observe or to lay a great deal 
and till called on by the general for her opinion of it she had very little idea of the room in which the was using 
upon looking round it then she perceived in a moment that it was the most comfortable room in the world 
but she was too guarded to say no and the coldness of her praise disappointed him 
we are not calling it a good home said he 
northanger abbey 
-5 we are not comparing it with fullerton and northanger 
we are considering it as a mere parsonage small and contained we allow but depend perhaps and habitable 
and altogether not inferior to the generality 
or in other words i believe there are few country personages in england half so good 
it may admit of improvement however 
far be it from me to say otherwise 
and anything in reason 
s how thrown out perhaps 
though between ourselves if there is one thing more than another my aversion it is a patched-up bow.’ catherine did not hear enough of this speech us understand or he by it 
and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by henry at the same time that a my full of refreshmentswas introduced byhis servant the general was shortly restored to his complacency and catherine to all her usual ease of spirits 
the room in question was of s commodious wellproportioned size and handsomely fitted up as a dining par our 
and on their quitting it to walk round the grounds she was shewn burst into a smaller apartment belonging peculiarly to the master of the house and made unusually tidy on the occasion 
and afterwards into win was to be the drawing-room with the appearance of which though unfurnished 
catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the general it was s prettily-sha room the windows reaching to the ground and e view from them pleasing though only over green meadows 
and she expressed her admiration at the moment with all the honest with which she felt it 
oh 
why do not you lit up this room mr tilney 
what i pity to have ﬁttedupl itisthepretdestroornleversswﬁtisthe prettiest room in the world 
i trust said the general with s most satisfied 206 non-ransom abbey 
smiles “thatitwillvuyqreedilybeﬁxminhcd wait only for a lady lasted a well if it wan my horse i should never it anywhere else 
oh what a sweet little cottage there in among the trees 
apple tree too 
it in the prettiest me it you like it you approve it as an object it ll enough 
henry remember that robinson is spoken to about it 
the cottage remain 
such a compliment recalledall catherine’s conaeioueneu and silenced her directly 
and though pointedly applied to by the game for her choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hanging nothing like an opinion on the subject could be drawn from her 
the insolence of fresh object and fresh air however w of great we in dissipating these embamuing associations and having reached the amamental part of the promise consisting of a walk round two indeed of a down on which henry’s geniue had begun to act about half a year ago she was mﬂiciendy recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure-ground she had ever been in before though there was not a shrubs in it higher than the green bench in the corner 
a winter into other meadows and through part of the village with a visit to the rules to examine some improvements and a charming game of play with a litter of puppies able to roll about 
brought them to four o'clock when catherine scarcely thought it would be three 
at four they were to dine and at six to set or 
on their return 
never had any day passed so quickly 
she could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem to create the smallest anoniihmen in the general 
nay that he was even looking at the ride 
table for cold meat which was not there 
his son and daughter obaervationt were of a different kind 
they had seldom seen him eat no heart at any able northanger abbey 
2 on but his own 
and never before known him so little bias concerted by the melted butter’a being oiled 
at six o'clock the general having taken his coffee the carriage again received them 
and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct throughout the whole visit to well natured wan her mind on the subject of his expectations that could the have felt equally confident of the wishes of union catherine would have quitted woodston with little anxiety at to the how or the when the might return to it

a catherine was limented out of further hitterneas frederick d not be in bath guilty while henry made herself so agree e. she resolved on not answering inbella’t letter and tried to think no more of it 
hum h1713 
on am this the general found himself obliged to go to london for a week 
and he left northanger earneetly regretting that any necessity would rob him even for an hour of mill morland’s company and anxious recommending the study of her comfort and amusement to his children a their chief object in his absence 
his departure gave catherine the hint experimental conviction that a loss may be sometimes a gun 
the happiness with which their time now passed every employment voluntary every laugh indulged every meal a scene of ease and good-humour walking where they liked and when they liked their hours pleasures and fatigue at their own com 
and made her ihomughly smile of the remains which the general’s presence had improved and most thankfully feel their preterit release from it 
such ease and such delights made her love the place and the 2 i 2 northanger abbey 
peoplemoreandmoreeveryday 
and had itnoe been for a dread of in not becoming expedient to leave the one and an apprehension of not being equally beloved by the other the would at each moment of each hay have been perfectly happy 
but the way now in the fourth week of her visit 
before the general came home the fourth week would be turned 
and perhaps it might seem an intrusion if she italdmuch longer 
thin was a painful consideration whenever it occurred 
and eager to get rid of such a weight on her mind the very soon resolved to speak no eleanor about it at once propoae going away and be guided in her conduct by the mannerin which her proposal might be taken 
aware that if the game herself much time the might feel it difficult to bring forward so unpleasant a subject she took the hint purity of being suddenly alone with eleanor and eleanor’l being in the middle of a speech about something verydiﬁerengto start forth her obligation of going away very soon 
eleanor looked and declared herself much concerned 
she had a hoped for the pleasure of her company for a much longer time 
had been misled perhaps by her wishes to suppose that a much longer visit had been promised and could not but think that if mr and mrs morland were aware of the pleasure was to have her there they would be too general to harden her return catherine explained 
a oh 
an to that papa and mamma were in no hurry at all 
as long an the wan happy they would always be aatisﬁ 7 a hen why might she ask in such a hurry merely to leave them 
7 a oh 
because the had been there so long says ifyoucanuae such words i an urge you no farther

oh no

for my own pleasure i could stay with you as long again 
and it wan northanger abbey

inhavingthiemureofunurine to learn yrernoved the force the other was likewise weakened 
the kindness the earnestness of eleanor’r manner in pressing her to my and henry’s gratiﬁed look on being told that her my was determined were such sweet proof of her importance with them up left her only just so much solicitude up the human mind can never do comfortably without 
she did almost always believe that henry loved her and quite aware that hit father and litter loved and even winked herto belong to them 
and believing to far her doubt and mxieu'el were merely eponive irritation henry was not able to oheyhit father't injunction of remaining wholly at northanger in attendance on the ladies during his absence in london 
the engagement of hit cunteat woodmn ohliging him to leave them onsamrdayforaooupleof nights 
his lot war not now what it had been while the general was at home 
it launched their gaiety but did not mind their comfort 
and the two girls agreeing in occupation and improving in intimacy found themede l0 well-mlﬁcient for the time to themselves that it wan eleven o'clock rather i late hour at the before they quitted the rooms on the day of henry they ha just reached the head the stain when it seemed far a the richness of the wall 
would allow them to judge that a carriage was driving up to the door and the next momentoonﬁmedtheideahytheloudnoiseofthe house-hell 
after the hint perturbation of surprize had passed away in a 
good heaven 
what can he the matter 
it war quickly decided by eleanor to be her eldest brother whose arrival wan often an mdden if not quite to unneeeonable and accordingly the hurried down to welcome him 
2 14 northanger abbey 
catherine walked on to her chamber making up her mind as well as she could to a further acquaintance with captain tilney and comfort herself under the unpleasant impression his conduct had her and the persuasion of his being by far too line a gentleman approve of her that at least they should not meet under such circumstances as would make their meeting materially painful 
she trusted he would never speak of miss shot and indeed as he must by this time be ashamed of the part he had acted there could he no danger of it 
and as long as all mention of bath scenes were avoided she thought she could behave to him very civilly 
in such considerations time passed away and it was certainly in his favour that eleanor should he so glad to see him and have so much to say for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival and eleanor did not come up 
at that moment catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery and listened for its continuance but all was silent 
scarcely however had she convinced her fancy of error when the noise of something moving close to her door made her start 
it seemed as if some one was touching the very doorway and in another moment a slight motion of the lock proved that some hand must he on it 
she trembled a little at the idea of anyone’s approaching so cautiously but resolving not to be again overcome by trivial appearances of alarm or misled by a raised imagination she stepped uietly forward and opened the door 
eleanor and only eleanor stood there 
catherine’s spirits however were mnquillized but for an instant for eleanor’s cheeks were pale and her manner greatly agitated 
though evidently intending to come in it seemed an effort to enter the room and a still greater to speak when there 
catherine supposing some uneasiness on captain tilney’s account could only express her concern by 1 it 
how northanger abbey 
3 i 5 silent attention obliged her to be seated rubbed her temples with lavender water and hung over her with aﬁ'ecu'onate solicitude

7 a you are mistaken indeed a normed eleanor looking at her most compassionately 
it is no one from woodston 
it is my father himself 
her voice faltered andhereyesweremmdtothegroundas she mentioned his name 
his unlocked-for return was enough in itself to make catherine’s heart sink and for a few moments shehardly supposed there were any thing worse to he told 
she aid nothing 
and eleanor endeavouring to collect herself and speak with calmness but with eyes su ll cut down soon went on 
a you are too good i am sure to think the worse of me for the part i am obliged to perform 
i am indeed a most unwilling messenger 
after what has so lately passed so lately been settled between us how joyfully how thankfully on my side 
as to your continuing here as i hoped for many many weeks longer how can i tell you that your kindness is not to he accepted and that the happiness your company hashitherto given us is to be repaid by butimustnottmstmyselfwithwords

a 6 0h 
this is nothing 
do not think about that 
and a we are to part a fey/hours sooner or later you know makes no difference 
i can be ready by seven 
let me be called in time eleanor saw that she wished to be alone 
and believing it better for each that they should avoid any farther conversation now left her with a i shall see you in the morning catherine’s swelling heart needed relief 
in eleanor presence friendship and pride had equally restrained her tears but no sooner was she gone than they burst forth in torrents 
turned from the house and in such a walk without any reason that could justify any apology that could atone for the abruptness the rudeness nay the insolence of it 
henry at a distance 
not able even to bid him farewell 
every hope every expectation from him suspended at least and who could say how long 
who could say when they might meet again 
and all this by such a man as general tilney so polite so well-bred and heretofore so particularly fond of her 
it was as incomprehensible as it was mortifying and grievous 
from what it could arise and where it would end were considerations of equal perplexity and alarm 
the manner in which it was done so grossly uncivil hurrying her away without any reference to her own convenience or allowing her even the appearance of choice as to the time or mode of her travelling 
of two days the earliest fixed on and of that almost the earliest hour as if resolved to have her be before he was stirring in the morning that he might not be obliged even to see her 
what could all this mean but an invention affront 
by some means or other she must have had the misfortune to offer him 
eleanor had wished to speak her from so painful a notion but catherine could not believe it possible that northanger abbey 
2 i 9 any injury or any misfortune could provoke such ill-will against a person not connected or at least not supposed to be connected with it 
heavily passed the night sleep or repose that deserved the name of sleep was out of the question 
that room in which her disturbed imagination had tormented her on her first arrival we again the scene of agitated spirits and quiet slumbers 
yet how different now the source of her inquietude from what it had been then 
how mournfully superior in reality and substance 
her anxiety had foundation in fact her fears in probability 
and with a mind so occupied in the contemplation of actual and natural evil the solitude of her situation the darkness of her chamber the activity of the building were felt and considered without the smallest emotion and though the wind was high and often produced strange and sudden noises throughout the house she heard it all as she lay awake hour after hour without curiosity or terror 
soon after six eleanor entered her room eager to show attention or give assistance where it possible 
but very little remained to be done 
catherine had not loitered 
she was almost dressed and her packing almost wished 
the possibility of some conciliatory message from the general occurred to her as his daughter appeared 
what so natural as that anger should pass away and repentance succeed it 
and she only wanted to know how far after what had an apology might properly be received by her 
at the knowledge would have been useless here it was not called for 
neither clemency nor dignity was put to the trial 
eleanor brought no message 
very little passed between them on meeting each found her greatest in silence 
and few and trivial were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs 
catherine in busy agitation completing her dress and eleanor with more good-will dun experience intent upon filling the 2 northanger abbey 
trunk 
when everything was done they left the room catherine lingering only half minute behind her friend to throw a parting glance on every well-known cherished and went down to the breakfast-parlour where breakfast wan prepared 
she tied to eat unwell to cave herself from the pain of being urged as to make her friend comfortable 
but she had no appear and could not swallow many mouthﬁrls 
the contrast between thieandherlastbreakfastin that room gave her fresh misery and strengthened her distaste for everything before her 
it wan not four-and-twenty hours ago since theyhadmthemmthemempambutin circumstances how different 
with what cheerful use what happy though false security had she then looked around her enjoying everything present and fearing little in future beyond henry’s going to woman for a day 
happy happy breakﬁm 
for henry had been there 
henry had sat by her and helped her 
these reflections were long indulged undisturbed by any address from her companion who eat as deep in thought as herself 
the appearance of the carriage was the first thing to startle and recall them to the recent moment 
catherine’s colour rose at the sight it 
and theindignity with which she was treated striking at that instant on her mind with peculiar force made her for a short time sensible only of resentment 
eleanor seemed now impelled into resolution and speech 
a you my 
write to me catherine 1 she cried 
a you must let me hear from you as soon as possible 
till i know you to be safe at home i shall not have an hour comfort formlemrataumauhawngmu-t entreat 
let me have the ntinﬁcﬁon of knowing that you are safe at fullerton and have found your family well 
and then till i can walk for your cor absence as i ought to do i will not expect more 
direct to me at lord longmwn’s and i must ask it under cover to alice.” northanger abbey 
221 no eleanor if you are not allowed to receive alemer ﬁnmmlammreihadbemrnotwrite 
there can be no doubt of my getting home safe.” eleanor only replied i can not wonder at your feelings 
i will not imporlune you 
i will trust to your own kindness of heart when i am at a distance from you 
but this with the look of sorrow accompanying it was enough to rest catherine’s pride in a moment and she instantly said a oh 
eleanor i will write to you indeed 
a there was yet another point which miss tilney was anxious to settle though somewhat embarrassed in speaking of 
that occurred to her that after so long an absence from home catherine might not be provided with money enough for the expenses of her journey and upon suggesting it to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation it proved to he exactly the case 
catherine had never thought on the subject till that moment 
but upon examining her purse was come since that but for this kindness of her friend she might have been turned form the house without even the means of getting home 
and the distress in which she must have been thereby involved filling the minds of both warper another word was said by either during the time of their remaining together 
short however was that time 
the carriage was soon announced to be ready 
and catherine instantly rising along and affectionate embnoe supplied the b act of language in bidding each other adieu 
and so they entered the hall unable to leave the house without some mention of one whose name had not yet been spoken by either she paused a moment and with quivering lips just made it intelligible that she left her kind remembrance for her absent friend but with this approach to his name ended all possibility of remaining her feelings 
and hiding her 222 northanger abbey 
face as well as she could with her handkerchief she darted across the hall jumped into the chaise and in a moment was driven from the door 
chasm it” 
catherine was too wretched to be fearful 
the journey itself had no terrors for her 
and she began it without either dreading its length or feeling its solitariness 
leaning back in one corner of the carriage in a violent burst tears she was conveyed some miles beyond the walls of the abbey before she raised her head 
and the highest point of ground within the park was almost closed from her view before she was capable of turning her eyes towards it 
unfommately the road she now travelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily passed along in going to and from woodston 
and for fourteen miles every bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects on which she had first looked under impressions so different 
every mile as it brought her nearer woodston added to her suffering 
and when within the distance of live she passed the turning which led to it and thought of dry so near yet so unconscious her grief and agitation were execssive 
the day which she had not at that place had been one of the happy less of her life 
t weathered it was on that day that the general had made use of such expressions with regard to henry and herself had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage 
yes only ten days ago had he wished her by his pointed regard 
had he even confused her by his too signiﬁcant reference 
and now what had the done or what had she omitted to do to merit such a change 
nothing abbey 
2 2 3 the only offence against him of which she could accuse herself had been such as was scarcely possible to reach his knowledge 
henry and her own heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly entermined 
and yet safe did she believe her secret with each 
dear s at least henry could not have betrayed her 
f indeed by any arrange miechanoe his father should have gained intelligence of what she had dared to think and look for of her canoeleu fancies and injurious examinations she could not wonder-stony degreeof his indignation 
if aware of her having viewed him as a murderer she could not wonder at his even turning her from his house 
but a justiﬁcation so full of torture to herself she used would not be in his power 
anxious as were all her conjectures on this into it was not however the one on which she dwelt most 
there was a thought yet nearer 
a more prevailing more impetuous concern 
how henry would think and feel and look when he returned on the morrow or northanger andheardof herheing gone was a question of force and interest to rise of every other to he never-ceding alternately imitating and soothing it sometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence and at other was answered by the sweetest confidence in his regretand resentment 
to the general of course he would not dare to 
but to eleanor what might he not say no eleanor shoot her 
in this unoeasing recurrence of double and inquiries on any one article of which her mind was incapable of more than momentary repose the hours passed away and her journey advanced much faster than she looked for 
the pressing anxieties of thought which prevent her from noticing anything before her when once beyond the neighbourhood of women saved her at the same time from watching her progress 
and though no object 24 northanger abbey 
on the road could engage a moment's attention she found no stage of it tedious 
from this she was preserved too by another cause 
by feeling no eagerness for her journey conclusion 
for to remain in such a manner to fullerton was almost to destroy the pleasure of a meeting with those she loved best even 1 an absence such as hers an elder weeks’ absence 
what had she to say that would not humble herself and pain her family 
that would not increase her own grief by the confession of it 
extend an useless resentment and perhaps involve the innocent with the guilty in undisn'nguishing ill-will 
she could never do justice to henry and eleanor’s merit she felt it too strongly for expression and should a dislike be taken against them should they be thought of unfavourably on their fathers account it would cut her to the heart 
with these feelings she rather dreaded than sought for the first view of that well-known spire which would announce her within twenty miles of home 
salisbury she had known to be her point on leaving northanger but after the first stage she had been indebted to the post-masters for the names of the places which were then to conduct her to it 
so great had been her ignorance of her route 
she met with nothing however to distress or frighten her 
her youth civil manners and liberal pay procured her all the attention that a n-aveller like herself could require 
and stopping only to change horses she travelled on for about eleven hours without accident or alarm and between six and seven o'clock in the evening found herself entering fullerton 
a heroine returning at the close of her career to her native village in all the triumph of recovered reyutation and all the dignity of a countless with a long train of noble relations in their several phaeton and three waiting-maids in a travelling chaise-and~four behind northanger abbey 
35 her is an event on which the pen of the oontriver may well delight to dwell 
it gives credit to every conclusion and the author must share in the glory she so liberally bestowed 
but my affair is widely different i bringbsckrnyheroine to her home in solitude and disgrace and no sweet claim of spirits can lad me into minuteness 
a heroine in a hack post-chaise is sad a blowupon sentiment as no attanptat grandeur or pathos can withstand 
swiftly therefore shall her post-boy drive through the village amid the gaze of sunday cups and speedy shall be her descent from it 
but whatever might be the times of catherine’s mind as she thus advanced towards the parsonage and whatever the humiliation of her biographerin relating it she was preparing enjoyment of no every-day nature for those to whom she went 
trust in the appearance of her carriage and secondly in herself 
the chaise of a traveller being a rare sight in fullerton the whole family were immediately at the window 
and to have itswpatthelweep-gaeewal apleasuretobrighten every eye and occupy every fancy 
a pleasure quite unlocked for by all but the two youngest children a boy and girl of six and four years old who expected abmdnrordsmrineverycarﬁageh the glance that first catherine

35 her father mother sarah george and harriet all assembled at the door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness was a sight to awaken the best feelings of catherine’s heart 
and in the embrace of each as she stepped from the carriage she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed possible 
so surrounded so caressed 
she was even happy 
in the 22nd normangrr ann

but namely within that time could they discover the came or collect the of her sudden return 
there is our being an unsuitable race 
far from an quickness in catching or bitterness in running up 
but here with the whole wan unfolded was an insult not to be overlooked nor for the in half hour to be easily pardoned without altering any romantic alarm in the consideration of their daughter long and lonely journey mr and mr morland could not but feel that it might have been productive of much unpleasanmeu to her 
that it was what they could never have voluntarily tuﬁ'ered 
and that in forcing her on such a return general tilney had acted neither honourath nor feelingly neither a a gentleman nor an a why he had done it what could have proved him to such a breach of hospitality and it suddenly turned all hit regard for their daughter into actual ill-will was a matter which they were at least 
as far from divining an catherine herself but it did not oppress them by my meant so long 
and after a due course of useless conjecture that a it was a range business and that he must be a very strange man a grew enough for all their indignation and wonder 
though sarah indeed still indulged in the sweets of incomprehensibility exclaiming and conjecturing with northanger abbey 
a 2 7 youthful ardour 
a my dear you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble 1 said her mother at last 
a depend upon it it in something not at all worth understandings a i can allow for his wishing catherine away when he recollected this engagement said sarah 
a but why not do it civilly 
a i am sorry for the young he a remedy an morland 
a they must have a some of 
but for anything else it in no matter now catherine is safe at home and our comfort does not depend upon general tilney 
catherine sighed 
well a continued her philosophic mother a i am glad i did not know of your journey at the time 
but now it in all over perhaps there in no harm done 
it is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselvea 
you know my dear catherine you always were a sad little rhatter-brained creature but now you must have been forced to have your fits about you with so much changing of choice and so forth 
and i hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets 
catherine hoped so no andtriedto feelanintereat in her own amendment but her spirits were quite worn down 
and to be silent and alone becoming noon her only wish she readily agreed to her mother next counsel of going early to bed 
her parents seeing nothing in her ill-loch and agitation but the natural consequence of mortiﬁed feelings and of the unusual exertion and fatigue of such a journey 
parted from her without any doubt of their being noon kept away 
and though when they all met the next morning her recovery war not equal to their hopes they were mild perfectly unsuspicious of there being any deeper evil 
they never once thought of her heart which for the payment of a young lady of seventeen just returned from her first excurrion from home war odd enough 
28 northanger sum 
asmasbreakfastwasover shentdownto fulfill her promise to miss tilney whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her friends disposition was already justiﬁed 
for already did catherine reproach herself with having parted from eleanor coldly 
with having never enough led her merit or kindness 
and never enoughoommiseratedherforwbatshehadheenymr 
day left to endure 
the strength of these feelings however was far from assisting her pen 
and never had it been harder for her to write than in addressing eleanor tilney 
to compose a letter which might at once do justice to her sentiments and her situation convey gratitude without sense regret be guarded without coldness and one without resentment 
a letterwhich eleanor might not be b the of 
and above all which she miss bylush week if henry should chance to see was an union to frighten away all her powers of performance 
and after long thought and much perplexity to be very brief was all that she could determine on with any confidence of safety 
the money therefore which eleanor had advanced was enclosed with little more than grateful thanks and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate heart 
this has been a large acquaintance 1 observed mrs morland as the letter was ﬁnidied

catherine took no quite by surprize yesterday evening said she 
she travelled all the way post by herself and knew nothing of coming till saturday night 
for general tilney from some odd fancy or other all of a sudden grew tired of having her there and almost turned her out of the house

a you may lee the home from this window air a wan information on sarah’a side which produced only a bow of acknowledgment from the pen em and a iileneing nod from her mother for mr morland thinking it probable as a secondary consideration in his with of waiting on their worthy neighboun that he might have jane explanation to give of his other behaviour which it must he more pleasant for him to communicate only to catherine would not on any account prevent her accompanying him 
they began their walk and mrs morland wan not entirely inimken in his object in wishing it 
some explanation on hiefnther’eaccounthehad togive 
but hieﬁrutpurpone wan to explain himself 
and before they reached 36 northanger abbey 
mr allen s grounds he had done it in well that catherine did not think it could ever be repeated too often 
she was assured of his affection 
and that heart in return was oolicited which perhaps they pretty equally knew was already entirely his own 
for though henry was now sincerely attached to her 
— though he felt and delighted in all the excellencies of her character and trulyloved her society 
i must confess that his affection originated in nothing better than gratitude 
or in other words thataperxnasionofherpanialityforhhn hadbeenthe only cause of giving her a serious thought 
it is a new circumstance in romance i acknowledge and dreadfully derogatory of an heroine dignity 
but if it be as new in common life the credit of a wild imagination will at least be all my own 
a very short visit to mrs allen in which henry talked at random without sense or connection and catherine wrapt in the contemplation of her own unutterable happiness scarcely opened her dismissed them to the easiest of another tétc-h-téte 
and before it was suffered to close she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority in his present application 
on his return from woodston two days before he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father hastily informed in angry terms of miss morland’s departure and ordered to think of her no more 
such was the permission s which he had now offered her his hand 
the aﬁ'righted catherine amidst all the tenor of expectation as she listened to this account could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious rejecuon by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject 
and as he proceeded to give the particulars and explain the motives of his father s conduct her soon hardened into even a triumphant delight 
the general had had nothing to accuse her of nothing to nonrmxcnn abbey 
37 lay to her charge but her being the involnnury unconscious object of a deep done which his pride could not pardon and which a pride would have been ashamed to own 
she was guilty only of being less rich than he had supposed her to be 
under mirtaken persuasion of her possessions and he had courted her acquaintance in bath iolicited her company at northanger and designed her for his daughter-in-law 
on discovering his error to turn her from the house seemed the best though to his feelings an inadequate proof of his resentment towards herself and his contents of her family 
oh thorpe had first misled him 
the general perceiving his son one night at the theatre to be paying considerable mention to miss morland had accidentally inquired of thorpe if he knew more of her than her name 
the most ha ay to be on speaking terms with a man of general tilney s importance had hem joyfully and proudly communicative 
and being at that time not only in daily expectation of morland engaging isabella but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying catherine himself his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them 
with whomsoever he was or was likely to be connected his own consequence alwayl required thatthein should he got 
and as his intimacy with any acquaintance grew la y grew their four 
the expectations of his mind morland therefore from the hint over-rated had ever since his introduction to isabella been gradually increasing 
and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment by doubting what he chose to think the amount of mr morland’s preferment treating his private fortune bestowing a rich aunt and sinking half the children he was able to represent the whole family to the general in a most respectable light 
2 38 non-mama abbey 
for catherine however the peculiar object or the general’s curiosity and his own speculations he had yet something more in reserve 
and the ten or after thousand pounds which her father could give her would he a pretty addition to mr allen s estate 
her intimacy there had made him seriously determine on her being handsomely legacied hereafter 
and to speak of her therefore as the almost acknowledged ﬁxture piece of fullerton naturally followed 
upon such intelligence the general had proceeded for never had it occurred to him to doubt its authority 
thorpe’s interest in the family by his sister's approaching connection with one of in mother and his own views on another of which he boasted with almost equal openness seemed suﬂicient vouches for his truth 
and to these were added the absolute facts of the allen being wealthy and coldness of miss morland’s being under their care and as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge of their thinking her with parental kindness 
his resolution was soon formed 
already had he discerned a liking towards miss morland in the countenance of hit son 
and thankful for mr thorpe’s communication he almost instantly determined to spare no pains in evening his boasted interest and rising his dearest hopes 
catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all this than his own children 
henry and almost perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their fathers cular respect had seen with astonishment the an entrees continuance and extent of his attention 
and though latterly from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in power to attach her henry was convinced of his father believing it to be an advantageous connection it was not till the be explanation at northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculation 
which had hurried northanger annnv 
39 him on 
that they were false the general had learned from the very person who had suggested them from thorpe himself whom he had chanced to meet again in town 
and who under the insolence of exactly opposite feelings irritated by catherine’s rears and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accept lish a reconciliation between morland and isabella convinced that they were for ever and spending a friendship which so d be no longer rervieeahle happened to contradict all that he had laid before to the advantage of the morland confused himaelfto have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father run of absence and credit whereas the action

for after coming eagerly forward on the first adventure of a marriage between the families with the most liberal proposals he had on being brought to the point by the threwdneu of the relation been confined to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support 
they were in fact a necessitous family 
numerous too almost beyond example 
by no means respected in their own neighbourhood is he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering 
aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant 
seeking to better themselves by wealthy connexion 
a for 
ward bragging scheming race 
the married general pronounced the name of allen with an inquiring look 
and here too thorpe had learnt his error 
the allen he believed had lived nearthem too long and he knew the young man on whom the fullerton eute must devolve 
the general neededno more 
enraged with almost everybody in the world but himself he let out the next day for the abbey where his performances have been seen

catherine at any rate heard enough to feel that in wapecdng general tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife she had scarcely sinned again his character or magniﬁed hit cruelty 
henry in having such things to relate of his father was almost an pitiable as in their first avnwal to him he blushed for the narrow-minded counsel which he was obliged to expose 
the conversation between them at nonlnnger had been the mostunfriendly kind 
henry’s indignation on hearing how catherine had been treated on comprehending his father s views and being ordered to acquiesce in them had been open and hold 
the general accustomed on every ordinary occasion to give the love in his family prepared for no reluctance but of a feeling no desire that should dare to clothe itself in words can d ill brook the opposition of his son ready as the sanction of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it 
but in such a cause his anger though it must ihock could not inﬁmidate henry who was detained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice 
he felt himself bound as much in honour as in affection to miss morland and believing that hurt to be his own which he had been directed to gain no unworthy restrictions of a tacit consent no reversing decree of unjustiﬁable anger could shake his utility or indulgence the resolution it prompted 
he steadily resigned to accompany his father into hertfordshire an engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the disposal of catherine and as northanger abbey 
24 l steadil declared his intention of offering her his hand 
the general was finding in his anger and they parted in dreadful disagreement 
henry in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours were required to compose had returned almost instantly to woman 
and on the afternoon of the following day had begun his journey to fullerton 
hum iii 
s and mr morland’s surprized on being applied to by mr tilney for their consent to hit marrying their daughter was for a few minutes considerable 
it having never entered their heads to expect an attachment on either side 
but as nothing after all could be more natural than catherine being beloved they soon learnt to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratitude pride 
and as far as they alone were concerned had not a single objection to start 
his pleasing manner and good sense were edfevident recommendation 
and having never heard evil of him it was not their way to oppose any evil could he told 
good-will supplying the place of experience his character needed no aueotation 
catherine would make a sad heedleu young housekeeper to be sure a wan her mother foreboding remark 
but quick wit the consolation of there being nothing like practice 
there was but one obstacle in short to be mentioned 
but till that one was removed it must be impossible for them to uncu‘on the engagement 
their tempers were mild but their principals were steady 
and while hiparent no exprenl forbad the connexion they could not allow vexed to encourage it 
that the general should come forward in solicited the 24 northanger abbey 
alliance or that he should even very heartily approve it they were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation but the decent appearance of consent must be yielded and that once obtained and their own hearts made them must that it could not be very long denied their willing approbation was instantly to follow 
his count was all that they wished for 
they were no more inclined than entitled to demand his money 
of a very considerable fortune his son was by marriage settlement eventually secure 
his present income was an income of independence and c on and under every pecuniary view it was a match beyond the claims of their daughter 
the young people could not be surprized at a decision like this 
they 
felt and they deplored but they could not resent it 
and they parted endeavouring to hope that such a change in the general as each believed almost in ssible might yet take c. to unite them again in the fullness of privileged aﬂecﬁou 
henry returned to what was now his only home to watch over his young plantations and extend his improvements for her sake to whose share in them he looked anxiously forward 
and catherine remained at fullerton to cry 
whether the contents of absence were softened by a clandestine correspondence let us not inquire 
mr and mr morland never did 
they had been too kind to exact any promise and whenever catherine received a letter as at that time happened pretty often they always looked another way 
the anxiety which in this state of their attachment must be the portion of henry and catherine and of all who loved either as no its usual event can hardly extend

by which their early marriage was effected can be the only doubt what probable circumstance could work upon a temper like the general’s 
the circumstance which chieﬂy availed was the
